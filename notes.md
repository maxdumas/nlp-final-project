Okay, so the plan of action for today is to basically do as much of your final project for NLP as possible. The first aspect of that is to determine what you're actually required to do for this, beyond just implementing the algorithm. You need to prepare your presentation, obviously, but do you also need to write some sort of paper or something? Yep we do, god damn it.

So we need to do three things:

1) Implement the algorithm
2) Prepare the talk â€” 3 slides (Due December 10)
3) Write a 6-10 page paper on the implementation of the algorithm (Due Dec 15)

Things to write about in the paper:

- Abstract
- The problem
- Explanation of the algorithm
- Explanation of the implementation
- Report on the success of the implementation
- Identify areas of improvement
- Discuss other algorithms and approaches possible

Check the paper you did for Numerical Computing for more inspiration

So I think the goal for today should be to become intimately familiar with the algorithm and get a suitable implementation of it up and running. Additionally you hould begin compiling a list of sources as you do your research. You should also try to get LaTeX up and running and a basic paper template compiled.

- Familiarize self with algorithm
- Implement algorithm (WELL)
    1. Implement baseline algorithm; train using a text annotated with word senses. Always choose the word sense that occurs most frequently.
        1.1. That means we need to (obviously) find a sense-annotated text...
        We found a sense-annotated text and we have the baseline algorithm set up.
- Accrete sources
x Get LaTeX running with paper template <- Save this for when you are dying

Then I think your goal for tomorrow should be to prepare the presentation and get as much of the paper done as possible.

++++ Important obstable to write about! Very difficult to obtain sufficient training data for full coverage!
