The

Modern

have have%2:40:00::

this
fusion

moral
and

largely
because

In
China
,
the
magical
system
par_excellence
was be%2:42:06::
Taoism
.
The
Taoists
were be%2:42:06::
Quietist
mystics
,
who
saw see%2:31:00::
an

unity

the
Tao

It
was be%2:42:06::
this
timeless
unity
that
was be%2:42:03::
all-important
,
and
not
its
temporary
manifestations

The
Taoists
believed believe%2:31:00::
the
unity
could

by
proper
magical
manipulation

in_other_words
,
they
were be%2:42:06::
actually
an
organization
of
magicians

Mahayana_Buddhism
was be%2:42:06::
no
exception
to
these
prevailing
magical
concepts
.
After
this
form
of
Indian_Buddhism
had
been
introduced introduce%2:30:03::
into
China
,
it
underwent undergo%2:31:00::
extensive
changes
.
During
its
flowering
in
the
sixth
to
the
eighth
centuries
,
Mahayana
offered offer%2:40:02::
a
supernatural
package
to
the
Chinese
which
bears bear%2:42:01::
no
resemblance
to
the
highly
digested
philosophical
Zen
morsels
offered offer%2:40:02::
to
the
modern
Western
reader
.
Mahayana
had have%2:42:00::
gods
,
and
magic
,
a
pantheon
,
heavens
and
hells
,
and
gorgeously
appareled
priests
,
monks
,
and
nuns
,
all_of
whom
wielded wield%2:40:00::
power
over
souls
in
the
other
world
.
The
self-realized
Mahayana
saint
possessed possess%2:42:00::
superhuman
powers
and
magic
.
The
Mahayana
that
developed develop%2:42:00::
in_the_north
was be%2:42:03::
a
religion
of
idolatry
and
coarse
magic
,
that
made make%2:30:00::
the
world
into
a
huge
magical
garden
.
In
its
monastic
form
,
Mahayana
was be%2:42:06::
merely
an
organization
of
magic-practicing
monks
(
bonzes
)
,
who
catered cater%2:34:00::
to
the
Chinese
faith
in
the
supernatural
.
Nonmagical_Confucianism
was be%2:42:06::
a
secular
,
rational
philosophy
,
but
even
with
this
different
orientation
it
could
not
escape_from escape_from%2:38:00::
the
ethos
of
a
cosmic
government
.
Confucianism
had have%2:42:00::
its
own
magic
in
the
idea
that
virtue
had have%2:40:00::
power
.
If
a
man
lived live%2:42:06::
a
classical
life
,
he
need need%2:42:00::
not
fear fear%2:37:00::
the
spirits
-
for
only
lack
of
virtue
gave give%2:40:03::
the
spirits
power
over
him
.
But
let
us
not
be
mistaken mistake%2:31:00::
about
Confucian
``
virtue
''
;
this
was be%2:42:03::
not
virtue
as
we
understand understand%2:31:00::
the
word
today
,
and
it
did
not
mean mean%2:42:00::
an
abandonment
of
the
belief
in
magic
manipulation
.
To
the
Confucian
,
``
virtue
''
simply
meant mean%2:42:00::
mastery
and
correct
observance
of
three
hundred
major
rules
of
ritual
and
three
thousand
minor
ones
.
Propriety
was be%2:42:03::
synonymous
with
ritual
observance
,
the
mark
of
a
true
gentleman
.
To
live live%2:42:06::
correctly
in
an
interdependent
moral
and
material
universe
of
living
and
dead
was be%2:42:03::
decisive
for
man
's
fate
.
This
,
in_brief
,
was be%2:42:06::
the
historical
background
out
of_which
Zen
emerged emerge%2:30:00::
.
Promoters
of
Zen
to
the
West
record record%2:32:00::
its
ancestry
,
and
recognize recognize%2:31:02::
that
Zen
grew grow%2:42:00::
out
of
a
combination
of
Taoism
and
Indian_Mahayana_Buddhism
.
But
the
``
marvelous
person
''
that
is be%2:42:03::
supposed
to
result result%2:42:00::
from
Zen
exhibits exhibit%2:39:01::
more
Chinese
practicality
than
Indian
speculation
-
he
possesses possess%2:42:00::
magical_powers
,
and
can
use use%2:34:01::
them
to
order order%2:30:00::
nature
and
to
redeem redeem%2:41:04::
souls
.
Proponents
of
Zen
to
the
West
emphasize emphasize%2:32:00::
disproportionately
the
amount
of
Mahayana_Buddhism
in
Zen
,
probably
in_order_to
dignify dignify%2:41:00::
the
indisputably
magical
Taoist
ideas
with
more
respectable
Buddhist
metaphysic
.
But
in
the
Chinese
mind
,
there
was be%2:42:04::
little
difference
between
the
two
-
the
bonzes
were be%2:42:03::
no_more
metaphysical
than
a
magician
has_to
be be%2:42:03::
.
Actually
,
Zen
owes owe%2:42:00::
more
to
Chinese
Quietism
than
it
does
to
Mahayana_Buddhism
.
The
Ch
'
an
(
Zen
)
sect
may
have
derived derive%2:40:00::
its
metaphysic
from
Mahayana
,
but
its
psychology
was be%2:42:03::
pure
early
Taoist
.
This
is_well
evidenced evidence%2:32:00::
by
the
Quietist
doctrines
carried_over carry_over%2:30:00::
in
Zen
:
the
idea
of
the
inward
turning turn%2:38:00::
of
thought
,
the
enjoinder
to
put put%2:35:05::
aside
desires
and
perturbations
so_that
a
return return%2:38:00::
to
purity
,
peace
,
and
stillness
-
a
union
with
the
Infinite
,
with
the
Tao
-
could
be
effected effect%2:36:00::
.
In_fact
,
the
antipathy
to
outward
ceremonies
hailed hail%2:32:02::
by
modern
exponents
as
so
uniquely
characteristic
of
the
``
direct
thinking
''
Zennist
was be%2:42:03::
a
feature
of
Taoism
.
So
,
too
,
was be%2:42:03::
the
insistence
on
the
relativity
of
the
external
world
,
and
the
ideas
that
language
and
things
perceived perceive%2:39:00::
by
consciousness
were be%2:42:06::
poor
substitutes
indeed
for
immediate
perception
by
pure
,
indwelling
spirit
:
the
opposition
of
pure
consciousness
to
ratiocinating
consciousness
.
Zen
maintains maintain%2:32:00::
that
cognitive
things
are be%2:42:06::
only
the
surface
of
experience
.
One
of
its
features
attractive
to
the
West
is be%2:42:06::
its
irreverence
for
tradition
and
dogma
and
for
sacred_texts
.
One
patriarch
is
supposed suppose%2:31:01::
to
have
relegated relegate%2:41:02::
sacred
scriptures
for
use
in
an
outhouse
.
But
this
is be%2:42:06::
not
the
spirit
of
self-reliant
freedom
of
action
for
which
the
Westerner
mistakes mistake%2:31:02::
it
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
simply
that
in
Taoist
tradition
-
as
in_all
good
mysticisms
-
books
,
words
,
or
any
other
manifestations
that
belong_to belong_to%2:42:00::
the
normal
state
of
consciousness
are
considered consider%2:31:00::
only
the
surface
of
experience
.
The
truth
-
the
Eternal
Truth
-
is be%2:42:03::
not
transmittable
by
words
.
Reality
is
considered consider%2:31:00::
not_only
irrelevant
to
the
acquisition
of
higher
knowledge
,
but
a
positive
handicap
.
The
technique
of
reality
confusion
-
the
use
of
paradox
and
riddles
to
shake shake%2:30:00::
the
mind
's
grip
on
reality
-
originated originate%2:42:00::
with
fourth
and
third
century
B._C._Chinese_Quietism
:
the
koan
is be%2:42:06::
not
basically
a
new
device
.
It
is
important
for
an
understanding
of
Zen
to
realize realize%2:31:01::
that
the
esoteric
preoccupations
of
the
select
few
cannot
be be%2:42:06::
the
doctrine
of
the
common_man
.
In
the
supernatural
atmosphere
of
cosmic
government
,
only
the
ruling
elite
was be%2:42:03::
ever
concerned
with
a
kingdom-wide
ordering
of
nature
:
popular
religion
aimed aim%2:33:00::
at
more
personal
benefits
from
magical_powers
.
And
this
is be%2:42:03::
only
natural
-
witness witness%2:39:01::
the
haste
with
which
modern_man
gobbles gobble%2:34:00::
the
latest
``
wonder_drug
''
.
Early
Chinese
anchoritism
was
theoretically
aimed aim%2:31:01::
at
a
mystic
pantheist
union
with
the
divine
,
personal
salvation
being
achieved achieve%2:41:00::
when
the
mystical
recluse
united unite%2:30:00::
with
divine
essence
.
But
this
esoteric
doctrine
was
lost lose%2:40:02::
in
the
shuffle
to
acquire acquire%2:40:00::
special
powers
.
The
anchorite
strove strive%2:41:00::
,
in_fact
,
to
magically
influence influence%2:41:00::
the
world
of
spirits
in
the
same
way
that
the
divine
emperor
manifested manifest%2:32:00::
his
power
.
Thus
,
the
Mahayana
metaphysic
of
mystical
union
for
salvation
was
distilled distill%2:30:03::
down
to
a
bare
self-seeking
,
and
for
this
reason
,
the
mystic
in
Asia
did
not_long
remain remain%2:42:03::
in
isolated
contemplation
.
As
the
Zen
literature
reveals reveal%2:39:01::
,
as
soon
as
an
early
Zen
master
attained attain%2:41:00::
fame
in
seclusion
,
he
was_called
out
into
the
world
to
exercise exercise%2:41:00::
his
powers
.
The
early
anchorite
masters
attracted attract%2:35:00::
disciples
because
of
their
presumed
ability
to
perform perform%2:41:02::
miracles
.
Exponents
of
Zen
often
insist insist%2:32:00::
that
very
early
Zen
doctrine
opposed oppose%2:32:01::
the
rampant
supernaturalism
of
China
,
and
proposed propose%2:32:00::
instead
a
more
mature
,
less
credulous
view
of
the
universe

In
support
of_this
,
stories
from
the
early
literature
are
cited cite%2:36:00::
to
show show%2:32:00::
that
Zen
attacks attack%2:32:00::

actually
these
accounts
reveal reveal%2:39:01::
the
supernatural

the
masters
were
in_fact
supposed
to
possess possess%2:42:00::

as_well

the
extreme
degree
