She
lived live%2:42:04::
and
was
given give%2:40:03::
a
name

Helva
.
For
her
first
three
vegetable
months
she
waved wave%2:35:00::
her
crabbed
claws
,
kicked kick%2:38:00::
weakly
with
her
clubbed
feet
and
enjoyed enjoy%2:39:00::
the
usual
routine
of
the
infant
.
She
was be%2:42:03::
not
alone
for
there
were be%2:42:04::
three
other
such
children
in
the
big
city

special
nursery
.
Soon
they
all
were
removed remove%2:38:00::
to
Central_Laboratory_School
where
their
delicate
transformation
began begin%2:42:00::
.
One
of
the
babies
died die%2:30:00::
in
the
initial
transferral
but
of
Helva
's
``
class
''
,
seventeen
thrived thrive%2:30:00::
in
the
metal
shells
.
Instead
of
kicking kick%2:38:00::
feet
,
Helva
's
neural
responses
started start%2:30:01::
her
wheels
;
instead
of
grabbing grab%2:35:00::
with
hands
,
she
manipulated manipulate%2:35:00::
mechanical

As
she
matured mature%2:30:00::
,
more_and_more
neural

would
be
adjusted adjust%2:30:00::
to
operate operate%2:35:00::
other

went_into go_into%2:42:00::
the
maintenance

For
Helva
was
destined destine%2:31:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
the
``

half
of
a
scout

,
partnered partner%2:40:00::
with
a
man
or
a

,
whichever
she
chose choose%2:31:00::
,
as
the

She
would
be be%2:42:03::
among
the
elite
of
her
kind
.
Her
initial
intelligence_tests
registered register%2:32:00::
above
normal
and
her
adaptation
index
was be%2:42:03::
unusually
high
.
As
long
as
her
development
within
her
shell
lived_up_to live_up_to%2:42:00::
expectations
,
and
there
were be%2:42:04::
no
side-effects
from
the
pituitary

,
Helva
would
live live%2:42:06::
a
rewarding
,
rich
and
unusual
life
,
a
far
cry
from
what
she
would
have
faced face%2:32:00::
as
an
ordinary

``

However
,
no

recorded record%2:32:01::
certain
essential
facts
about
Helva
that
Central

eventually
learn learn%2:31:01::

They
would
have
to
bide bide%2:42:00::

,
trusting trust%2:31:02::
that
the
massive

would
suffice suffice%2:42:00::
her
,
too
,
as
the
necessary
bulwark
against
her
unusual
confinement
and
the
pressures
of
her
profession
.
A

run run%2:41:02::
by
a
human

could
not

insane
with
the

into

Brain

were be%2:42:03::

And
very

very_few

when
the
final

was
made make%2:41:00::

So
,
for
happy

,
Helva
scooted scoot%2:38:00::
around
in

with

playing play%2:33:00::

all

Not

to

of

Helva

Helva

had have%2:42:00::

in

``

There

There
were be%2:42:04::
several

Helva
had
been be%2:42:03::
