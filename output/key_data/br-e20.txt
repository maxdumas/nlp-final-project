One
of
the
more
remarkable
of
the
new
cooling_systems
is be%2:42:06::
one
that
can
be
switched switch%2:30:03::
to
heating
.
As
you
know know%2:31:01::
,
a
conditioner
makes make%2:30:00::
indoor
air
cool
by
pumping pump%2:35:00::
the
heat
out
of_it
and_then
releasing release%2:35:00::
this
heat
outdoors

A
relatively
simple
switching
arrangement
reverses reverse%2:30:00::
the
cycle
so_that
the
machine
literally
runs run%2:35:04::
backward
,
and
the
heat
is
extracted extract%2:35:04::
from
outdoor
air
and
turned turn%2:35:08::
indoors
.
Up
until
recently
,
this
heat_pump
method
of
warming
air
was be%2:42:03::
efficient
only
in
areas
of
mild
winters
and
when
outside
temperatures
were be%2:42:03::
above
40
degrees
.
Now
,
the
machine
has
been
improved improve%2:30:01::
to
a
point
where
it
is be%2:42:03::
generally
more
economical
than
oil
heat
at
temperatures
down
to
15
degrees
.
You
can
get get%2:40:00::
this
added
heating
feature
for
as
little
as
$
200
more_than
the
price
of

it
will
depend_upon depend_upon%2:42:00::
your
personal
habits

the
makeup

Families
with

usually
do

out

house
in
an
hour
.
A
very
rough
rule_of_thumb
is be%2:42:06::
that
,
under
favorable
conditions
,
you
'll
need need%2:42:00::
15
BTU
's
of
cooling
for
every
square_foot
of
your
house
.
This
is be%2:42:03::
if
outdoor
temperatures
have have%2:42:00::
a
high
average
of
95
degrees
.
You
'll
need need%2:42:00::
more
if
the
high
average
is be%2:42:03::
above
that
,
less
if
it
's

Coolers
are
also
rated rate%2:31:00::
by

A

of
cooling
compares compare%2:31:01::
to
the
cooling
you
get get%2:30:03::
by
melting melt%2:30:01::
a
ton
of
ice
.
By
accepted
definition
,
a
1
-
ton
conditioner
will
provide provide%2:34:00::
12000
BTU
of
cooling
in
one
hour
.
You
may
find find%2:39:01::
a
conditioner
rated rate%2:31:00::
by
horsepower
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
generally
an
inaccurate
method
of
rating
,
for
the
horsepower
is be%2:42:07::
that
of
the
compressor

,
and
many
other
components
beside
it
determine determine%2:31:02::
how
much
cooling
you
'll
get get%2:30:03::
.
A
1

conditioner
,
for_example
,
may
vary vary%2:42:01::
in
effectiveness
from
under
8000

to
well
over

.
The
safest
procedure
is be%2:42:06::
to
let let%2:41:00::
your
builder
estimate estimate%2:31:00::
the
size
of
the
unit
you
need need%2:42:00::
,
rather_than
trying try%2:41:00::
to
do do%2:41:01::
this
yourself
.
Do
n't
urge urge%2:32:03::
your
builder
to
give give%2:40:05::
you
a_little
extra
cooling
capacity
just
to
be be%2:42:03::
sure
you
have have%2:40:00::
enough
.
Better
to
have have%2:30:00::
your
equipment
slightly
undersized
than
too
big
.
Here
's
why
:
Reducing reduce%2:30:00::
humidity
is be%2:42:03::
often
as
important
as
cooling cool%2:30:01::
.
An
oversize
unit
will
cool cool%2:30:01::
off
your
house
quickly
,
then
shut_down shut_down%2:41:00::
for
a
long
period
.
Before
it
cycles cycle%2:38:02::
on
again
,
humidity
can
build_up build_up%2:30:01::
and
make make%2:30:00::
you
uncomfortable
even_though
the
temperature
is be%2:42:03::
still
low
.
With
a
unit
of
the
right
size
,
a
compressor
will
run run%2:35:00::
continuously
during
hot_weather
,
reducing reduce%2:30:00::
humidity
as
evenly
as
it
does
temperature
.
Attention
to
details
can
cut cut%2:30:06::
in
half
the
size
unit
you
need need%2:42:00::
and
pare pare%2:30:00::
operating
expense
proportionately
.
A
well-designed
,
1200
-
square-foot
house
can
be
comfortably
cooled cool%2:30:01::
and
heated heat%2:30:01::
for
as
little
as
$
128
a
year
,
or
$
11
a
month
.
If
you
have have%2:40:00::
a
house
which
heat
does
n't
penetrate penetrate%2:35:00::
easily
,
your
unit
will
have have%2:40:00::
less
heat
to
remove remove%2:30:00::
.
Keep keep%2:41:01::
the
direct
sun
from
reaching reach%2:38:01::
the
house
and
you
've
won win%2:33:00::
the
first
battle
.
In
a
new
house
,
generous
roof
overhangs
are be%2:42:06::
a
logical
and
effective
solution
.
If
the
house
you
plan plan%2:31:01::
to
buy buy%2:40:00::
or
build build%2:36:00::
won
n't
have have%2:42:00::
big
overhangs
,
you
can
still
do do%2:41:04::
a
fair
job
of
keeping keep%2:41:01::
the
sun
off
walls
and
windows
with
properly
designed
trellises
,
fences
and
awnings
.
Shade_trees
,
too
,
are be%2:42:03::
a
big
help
,
so
keep keep%2:40:00::
them
if
you
can
.
Drawn
blinds
and
draperies
do do%2:36:02::
some
good
,
but
not_nearly
as
much_as
shading
devices
on_the_outside
of
the
house
.
The
more
directly
the
sun
strikes strike%2:35:01::
walls
and
roof
,
the
greater
its
heat
impact
.
The
way
a
house
is
set set%2:35:00::
on
its
lot
can
therefore
influence influence%2:41:00::
how
much
