I
just
wish wish%2:31:00::
to
congratulate congratulate%2:32:01::
Inspector_Trimmer
and
his
efficient
police
troops
in
cleaning clean%2:30:01::
the
city
of
those
horrible
automobiles
.
We
have have%2:40:00::
now
a
quiet
city
,
fewer
automobiles
,
less
congestion
,
and
fewer
retail
customers
shopping shop%2:40:00::
in
center
city
.
Good
for
Mr._Trimmer
.
Maybe
he
will
help help%2:41:00::
to
turn turn_into%2:42:00::
our
fair
city
into
a
``
ghost
''
town
.
I
worked_on work_on%2:41:00::
the
Schuylkill_Expressway
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
big
trucks
carrying carry%2:35:02::
rock
and
concrete
there
would
n't
be be%2:42:04::
an
Expressway
.
Without
these
massive
trucks
highways
would
still
be be%2:42:03::
just
an
idea
of
the
future
.
Mr._George_Hough
(
Oct.
30
)
sounds sound%2:39:06::
like
a
business
man
who
waits wait%2:42:01::
until
the
last
minute
to
leave leave%2:38:01::
his
home
or
shop
.
The
trucks
today
help help%2:41:00::
pay pay%2:40:00::
for
this
highway
.
They
try try%2:41:00::
to
keep keep%2:42:00::
within
the
speed_limits
.
Although
today
's
trucks
are be%2:42:03::
as
fast
as
passenger_cars
,
a
truck_driver
has
to
be be%2:42:06::
a
sensible
person
and
guard guard%2:41:00::
against
hogging hog%2:40:00::
the
road
.
The
letter_writer
who
suggested suggest%2:32:00::
saving save%2:40:01::
money
by
taking take_out%2:41:01::
kids
out
of
school
at
14
should
have
signed sign%2:32:02::
his
letter
``
Simpleton
''
instead
of
``
Simplicitude
''
.
Such
kids
only
wind_up wind_up%2:30:01::
among
the
unemployed
on
relief
or
in
jail
where
they
become become%2:30:00::
a
much
bigger
burden
.
There
are be%2:42:04::
lots_of
jobs
available
for
trained
high_school
graduates
,
but
not
for
the
dropouts
.
What
we
need need%2:34:00::
is be%2:42:06::
more
vocational
training
in
high_schools
,
not
more
dropouts
.
I
suppose suppose%2:31:00::
I
am
missing miss%2:39:00::
some
elementary
point
but
I
honestly
cannot
see see%2:31:01::
how
two
wrongs
can
make make%2:36:00::
a
right
!
I
am
referring refer%2:32:01::
to
this
country
conducting conduct%2:41:00::
atmosphere
tests
of
nuclear
bombs
just
because
Russia
is
.
Will
our
bombs
be be%2:42:03::
cleaner
or
will
their
fallout
be be%2:42:03::
less
harmful
to
future
generations
of
children
?
If
an
atom_bomb
in
1945
could
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
an
entire
city
surely
the
atomic
arsenal
we
now
have have%2:40:00::
is be%2:42:03::
more_than
adequate_to
fulfill fulfill%2:36:00::
any
military
objective
required require%2:42:00::
of_it
.
As
I
see see%2:31:01::
it
,
if
war
starts start%2:30:00::
and
we
survive survive%2:42:01::
the
initial
attack
enough
to
be be%2:42:03::
able
to
fight_back fight_back%2:33:01::
,
the
nuclear_weapons
we
now
have have%2:40:00::
-
at_least
the
bombs
-
can
inflict inflict%2:32:00::
all
the
demage
that
is be%2:42:03::
necessary
.
Why
do
we
need need%2:34:00::
bigger
and
better
bombs
?
I
repeat repeat%2:32:00::
,
two
wrongs
do
not
make make%2:36:00::
a
right
.
Everyone
should
take take%2:40:06::
time
to
read read%2:31:00::
Martin_Luther
's
Hymn
``
A
Mighty_Fortress
Is be%2:42:06::
Our

Especially
the
first_half
of
the
third
verse

To
our
everlasting
shame
,
we
led lead%2:42:01::
the
world
in_this
nuclear
arms_race
sixteen
years
ago
when
we
dropped drop%2:38:01::
the
first
bombs
on
Hiroshima
and
Nagasaki
.
Having
led lead%2:42:01::
the
world
in_this
mad
race
I
pray pray%2:32:00::
that
we
may
have have%2:40:00::
the
wisdom
and
courage
to
lead lead%2:38:01::
it
out
of
the
race
.
Are
we
to
be be%2:42:06::
the
master

atom
,
or
will
the
atom
be be%2:42:06::
our
master

and
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
us

Just
because
Cheddi_Jagan
,
new
boss
of
British_Guiana
,
was
educated educate%2:41:00::
in
the
United_States
is be%2:42:03::
no
reason
to
think think%2:31:03::
he
is be%2:42:03::
n't
a
Red
.
We
have have%2:40:00::
quite_a_few
home-grown
specimens
of
our
own
.
If
we
go_all_gooey
over
this
newest
Castro
(
until
he
proves prove%2:31:00::
he
is be%2:42:03::
n't
)
we
've
got get%2:40:00::
rocks
in
our
heads
.
How
many_times
must
we
get get%2:30:00::
burned
before
we
learn learn%2:31:00::
?
Just
to
remind remind%2:31:00::
the
Communists
that
the
bombs
dropped drop%2:38:01::
on
Japan
were be%2:42:03::
to
end end%2:30:01::
a
war
not
start start%2:30:01::
one
.
The
war
could
have
continued continue%2:42:01::
many
years
with
many
thousands
killed kill%2:35:00::
on
both
sides
.
Intelligent
people
will
admit admit%2:32:00::
that
bombs
and
rockets
of
destruction
are be%2:42:03::
frightening
whether
they
fall fall%2:38:03::
on
Japan
,
London
or
Pearl_Harbor
.
That
is be%2:42:03::
why
the
United_Nations
was
formed form%2:41:00::
so_that
intelligent
men
with
good
intentions
from
all
countries
could
meet meet%2:41:00::
and
solve solve%2:31:00::
problems
without
resorting resort%2:41:11::
to
war
.
Russia
has
showed show%2:32:00::
its
intentions
by
exploding explode%2:30:01::
bombs
in
peace
time
to
try try%2:41:00::
to
frighten frighten%2:37:00::
the
world

Why
are
n't
the
Soviets
expelled expel%2:41:00::
from

U._N.

While
``
better
late
than
never
''
may
have have%2:42:00::
certain
merits
,
the
posthumous
award
of
the
Nobel_Prize
for
Peace
to
the
late
Dag_Hammarskjold
strikes strike%2:37:00::
me
as
less_than
a
satisfactory
expression
of
appreciation
.
Had
it
been
bestowed bestow%2:40:00::
while
the
Secretary_General
of
the
United_Nations
was be%2:42:03::
living
,
unquestionably
he
would
have
been be%2:42:03::
greatly
encouraged
in
pursuing pursue%2:41:00::
a
difficult
and
,
in
many
ways
,
thankless
task
.
According
to
one
report
,
however
,
Mr._Hammarskjold
was
considered consider%2:31:00::
``
too
controversial
''
a
figure
to
warrant warrant%2:32:00::
bestowal
of
the
coveted
honor
last
spring
.
Actually
,
of_course
,
that
label
``
controversial
''
applied apply%2:42:00::
only
because
he
was
carrying_out carry_out%2:36:00::
the
mandate
given give%2:40:03::
him
by
the
world_organization
he
headed head%2:41:00::
rather_than
following follow%2:41:00::
the
dictates
of
the
Soviet_Union
.
At
Khrushchev
's
door
,
therefore
,
can
be
placed place%2:35:00::
the
primary
blame
but
also
at_fault
are be%2:42:03::
those
who
permitted permit%2:32:00::
themselves
to
be
intimidated intimidate%2:37:00::
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
well
for
us
to
remember remember%2:31:01::
that
a
wreath
on
a
coffin
never
can
atone atone%2:41:12::
for
flowers
withheld withhold%2:40:00::
while
they
still
can
be
enjoyed enjoy%2:37:00::
.
As
has
happened happen%2:30:00::
so
often
in_the_past
,
the
ability
to
recognize recognize%2:39:01::
true
greatness
has
been be%2:42:03::
inadequate
and
tardy
.
Just
a
brief
note
of
appreciation
to
Vice_President
Johnson
and
Pakistani
camel
driver
Bashir_Ahmad
for
providing provide%2:40:00::
a
first-class
example
of
``
people
to
people
''
good_will
.
If
only
this
could
be
done do%2:41:01::
more_often
-
with
such
heartening
results
-
many_of
the
earth
's
``
big
problems
''
would
shrink shrink%2:30:02::
to
the
insignificances
they
really
are be%2:42:03::
.
P._S.
.
Thanks
for
your
good
coverage
of
Ahmad
's
visit
,
too
!
Your
continuing
editorials
concerning
the
Schuylkill_Expressway
are be%2:42:03::
valuable
;
however
,
several
pertinent
considerations
deserve deserve%2:42:00::
recognition
.
One
of
the
problems
associated
with
the
expressway
stems stem%2:42:00::
from
the
basic
idea
.
We
shuffle shuffle%2:38:01::
a
large
percentage
of
the
cars
across
the
river
twice
.
They
start start%2:38:02::
on
the
East_side
of
the
Schuylkill
,
have have%2:42:05::
to
cross cross%2:38:00::
over
to
the
West
to
use use%2:34:01::
the
expressway
and
cross cross%2:38:00::
over_again
to
the
East
at
their
destination
.
Bridges
,
tunnels
and
ferries
are be%2:42:06::
the_most
common
methods
of
river
crossings
.
Each
one
of
these
is be%2:42:03::
,
by
its
nature
,
a
focal_point
or
a
point
of
natural
congestion
.
We
should
avoid avoid%2:32:00::
these
congestion
points
or
,
putting put%2:32:00::
it
another
way
,
keep keep%2:42:00::
ars
starting start%2:38:02::
and
ending end%2:42:00::
on
the
East_side
of
the
river
-
on
the
East_side
.
This
can
be
accomplished accomplish%2:36:00::
by
several
logical
steps
:
Widen widen%2:30:00::
the
East_River
Drive
at
least
one
lane
.
So
widen widen%2:30:00::
it
as
to
minimize minimize%2:30:00::
the
present
curves
and
eliminate eliminate%2:30:01::
drainage
problems
.
Paint paint%2:35:00::
continuous
lane
stripes
and
install install%2:35:00::
overhead
directional
lights
as
on
our
bridges
.
One
additional
lane
would
then
be be%2:42:03::
directional
with
the
traffic
burden
and
effectively
increase increase%2:30:02::
the
traffic
carrying_capability
of
the
East_River_Drive
by
fifty_percent
.
This
could
be
accomplished accomplish%2:36:00::
without
the
tremendous
expenditures
necessitated necessitate%2:42:00::
by
the
Schuylkill_Expressway
and
without
destroying destroy%2:36:00::
the
natural
beauty
of
the
East_River_Drive
.
I
wish wish%2:31:00::
to
advocate advocate%2:32:00::
two
drastic
changes
in
Washington_Square
:
Take_away take_away%2:30:01::
George_Washington
's
statue
.
Replace replace%2:30:00::
it
with
the
statue
of
one
or
another
of
the
world
's
famous
dictators
.
There
's
no
sense
in
being
reminded remind%2:31:00::
of
times
that
were
.
Washington_Square
seems seem%2:39:00::
not
part
of
a
free
land
.
It
may
remind remind%2:31:00::
one
of
Russia
,
China
or
East_Berlin
;
but
it
can
n't
remind remind%2:31:00::
one
of
the
freedom
that
Washington
and
the
Continental
soldiers
fought fight%2:33:00::
for
.
The
Fairmount_Park_Commission
will
no_doubt
approve approve%2:32:00::
my
two
proposals
,
because
it
is be%2:42:03::
responsible_for
the
change
of
ideological
atmosphere
in
the
Square
.
The_matter
may
seem seem%2:39:00::
a
small
thing
to
some
people
,
I
know know%2:31:01::
,
but
it
's be%2:42:03::
a
very
good
start
on_the_road
to
Totalitarianism
.
The
Commission
has
posted post%2:35:02::
signs
in
Washington_Square
saying say%2:32:00::
:
The
Feeding
of
Birds
is be%2:42:03::
Prohibited
in_This
Square
.
Fairmount_Park_Commission
Does
each
tentacle
of
the
octopus
of
City_Government
reach_out reach_out%2:35:00::
and
lash lash%2:35:01::
at
whatever
it
dislikes dislike%2:37:00::
or
considers consider%2:31:00::
an
annoyance
?
If
birds
do
n't
belong belong%2:42:00::
in
a
Square
or
Park
,
what
does
?
They
are be%2:42:03::
the_most
beautiful
part
of_that
little
piece
of
Nature
.
The
trees
are be%2:42:06::
their
homes
;
but
the
Commission
does
not
share share%2:42:00::
such
sentiments
.
The
whole
official
City
apparently
has have%2:40:00::
an
intense
hatred
toward
birds
.
Starlings
and
blackbirds
are
scared_off scare_off%2:37:00::
by
cannon
,
from
City_Hall
.
Just
a
preliminary
measure
.
If
any
are be%2:42:03::
left
,
presently
,
we
may
expect expect%2:31:00::
to
see see%2:39:00::
signs
specifically
prohibiting prohibit%2:32:00::
the
feeding
of
them
too
.
The
City_Government
is be%2:42:03::
not
united
in
an
all-out
,
to-the-death
drive
to
stamp_out stamp_out%2:30:00::
gangs
,
delinquents
,
thugs
,
murderers
,
rapists
,
subversives
.
Indeed
no
.
Let
every
policeman
and
park
guard
keep keep%2:42:00::
his
eye
on
John
and
Jane_Doe
,
lest
one
piece
of
bread
be
placed place%2:35:00::
undetected
and
one
bird
survive survive%2:42:01::
.
Of_course
,
in_this
small
way
of
forcing force%2:41:00::
the
people
to
watch watch%2:39:02::
as
tiny
and
innocent
and
dependent
creatures
die die%2:30:00::
because
we
're be%2:42:03::
afraid
to
feed feed%2:34:01::
them
and
afraid
to
protest protest%2:32:00::
and
say say%2:32:00::
``
How_come
?
What
's
your
motive
?
Who
wants want%2:37:00::
this
deed
done do%2:41:01::
''
?
-
in_this
small
way
do
the
leaders
of
a
city
,
or
of
a
nation
,
inure inure%2:30:00::
the
masses
to
watching watch%2:39:02::
,
or
even
inflicting inflict%2:32:00::
,
torture
and
death
,
upon
even
their
fellow
men
.
One
means
to
help help%2:41:00::
the_birds
occurs occur%2:31:00::
to
me
:
Let
the
chimes
that
ring ring%2:39:00::
over
Washington_Square
twice
daily
,
discontinue discontinue%2:42:00::
any
piece_of_music
but
one
.
Let
them
offer offer%2:40:00::
on
behalf
of
those
creatures
whose
melody
has
been be%2:42:06::
the
joy
of
mankind
since
time
began begin%2:42:00::
,
the
hymn
``
Abide
With
Me
''
.
We
will
know know%2:31:01::
,
and
He
will
know know%2:31:01::
,
to
whom
it
is
rendered render%2:40:02::
,
what
the_birds
would
ask ask%2:32:01::
.
There
is be%2:42:04::
a
trend
today
to
bemoan bemoan%2:32:00::
the
fact
that
Americans
are be%2:42:03::
too
``
soft
''
.
Unfortunately
,
those
who
would
remedy remedy%2:30:00::
our
``
softness
''
seek seek%2:41:00::
to
do do%2:41:01::
so
with
calisthenics
.
They
are
working_on work_on%2:41:00::
the
wrong
part
of
our
anatomy
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
not
our
bodies
but
our
hearts
and
heads
that
have
grown grow%2:30:03::
too
soft
.
Ashamed
of
our
wealth
and
power
,
afraid_of
so-called
world
opinion
and
addicted
to
peace
,
we
have
allowed allow%2:41:00::
our
soft-heartedness
to
lead lead%2:42:12::
to
soft-headed
policies

When
we

firm
enough
to
stand stand%2:31:01::
for
those
ideals
which
we
know know%2:31:02::
to

strong
enough
to

socialism
in

when
we
recognize recognize%2:31:01::
that
our
enemy

Communism

when
we
realize realize%2:31:01::
that

then
,
and

The
new
column
by
Maurice_Stans
regarding
business
scandals
,
is be%2:42:03::
fair
and
accurate
in
most
respects
and
his
solution
to
the
problem
has have%2:40:00::
some
merit
.
However
,
he
states state%2:32:00::
unequivocally
``
the
scandals
in
business
are be%2:42:03::
far
less
significant
than
the
scandals
in_labor
''
.
I
must
,
in
fairness
,
take_issue take_issue%2:32:00::
with
his
premise
,
primarily
because
the
so-called
scandals
in_labor
unions
were be%2:42:03::
very_much
connected
with
business
scandals
.
The
area
most
prominently
commented comment%2:32:00::
on
during
the
McClellan
hearings
had have%2:42:12::
to
do do%2:42:00::
with
``
sweetheart
contracts
''
.
These
arrangements
would
have
been be%2:42:03::
impossible
if
the
business_community
was be%2:42:03::
truly
interested
in
the
welfare
of
its
employes
.
A
sweetheart
arrangement
can
come_about come_about%2:30:00::
as
often
by
employers
doing do%2:41:01::
the
corrupting
as
by
unscrupulous
labor_leaders
demanding demand%2:32:00::
tribute
.
Anyone
familiar_with
the
details
of
the
McClellan
hearings
must
at_once
realize realize%2:31:00::
that
the
sweetheart

augmented augment%2:30:01::
employer
profits
far
more_than
they
augmented augment%2:30:01::
the

of
the

Further
,
it
should
be

that
some
very
definite

were
taken take%2:41:04::
by
Congress
