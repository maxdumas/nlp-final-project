``
He
must
have
forgiven forgive%2:32:00::
me
''
,
Henrietta
murmured murmur%2:32:00::
to
the
room
.
The
absolution
of
Doaty
's
last
will
and
testament
was be%2:42:03::
proof
enough
of_that
;
Doaty
would
never
have
left leave%2:40:01::
her
house
to
a
godless
woman
.
She
found find%2:39:01::
herself
wishing wish%2:32:02::
an
old
wish
,
that
she
had
told tell%2:32:00::
Doaty
she
was
running_away run_away%2:38:00::
,
that
she
had
left leave%2:31:05::
something
more
behind
her
than
the
loving
,
sorry
note
and
her
best
garnet
pin
.
Perhaps
Doaty
had
guessed guess%2:31:00::
already
and
kept keep%2:41:03::
her
counsel
.
Henrietta
thought think%2:31:00::
,
It
's
extraordinary
how
much
she
always
knew know%2:31:03::
about
both
of
us
.
There
had
been
more
to
know know%2:31:03::
about
Hetty
,
inevitably
,
and
most_of
it
unfavorable
.
Adelia
was be%2:42:06::
the
good
one
,
or
,
if_not
always
good
,
less
frequently
tempted tempt%2:32:01::
.
Their
childhood
would
have
been be%2:42:03::
quite
circumspect
without
Hetty
's
flair
for
drama
,
especially
through
the
long
summers
.
In
winter
,
in
the
city
,
there
had
been be%2:42:05::
the
Maneret_School
,
which
taught teach%2:32:00::
excellently
with
a
kind_of
austere
passion
for
knowledge
;
there
had
been be%2:42:04::
lessons
in
French
from
a
small
Polish
nobleman
with
a
really
profound
distaste
for
his
pupils
;
there
had
been be%2:42:04::
the
dancing
class
-
Miss_Craddock
,
thin
and
tireless
,
with
her
supervising
wand
and
her
everlasting
one-two-three
,
one-two-three
.
There
had
been be%2:42:04::
supper
parties
and
teas
,
fetes
and
little
balls
,
Mama
small
and
pretty
and
gay
and
Papa
enormously
jocular
,
enormously
possessive
,
the
sun
around
which
the
Blackwell
planets
revolved revolve%2:38:01::
.
Mama
had
died die%2:30:00::
before
the
corruption
of
the
family_circle
,
the
interruption
of
Charles
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
safe
to
assume assume%2:31:00::
that
Papa
,
sighing sigh%2:29:00::
heavily
,
had
said say%2:32:00::
many_times
to
his
remaining
daughter
,
``
Thank thank%2:32:00::
God
your
poor
mother
was
spared spare%2:41:01::
this
''
,
and
indeed
it
might
be be%2:42:03::
true
that
it
had
been be%2:42:03::
easier
for
Henrietta
to
leave leave%2:38:01::
,
with
her
hand
in
Charles
'
hand
,
just
because
her
``
poor
mother
''
was be%2:42:03::
gone
already
and
would
never
know know%2:31:01::
.
Mama
was be%2:42:03::
vulnerable
;
one
had
always
felt feel%2:37:00::
the
need
to
make make%2:36:00::
a
safe
world
around
her
.
But
I
would
have
gone go%2:38:00::
anyway
,
thought think%2:31:00::
Henrietta
.
She
had
always
been be%2:42:03::
able
to
ignore ignore%2:32:02::
the
moral
question
because
there
had
been
no
choice
.
Only
at
this
moment
-
perhaps
because
it
was be%2:42:03::
before
dawn
and
she
was
lying lie%2:35:00::
in
Doaty
's
bed
-
she
found find%2:39:01::
herself
examining examine%2:31:00::
how
others
might
regard regard%2:31:00::
her
.
Perhaps
they
would
argue argue%2:32:02::
that
morality
consisted consist_of%2:42:01::
just
of_that
ability
to
see see%2:31:01::
a
choice
.
She
turned turn%2:38:00::
on
her
side
,
finding find%2:31:10::
the
idea
oppressive
.
If
Adelia
had
felt feel%2:37:00::
about
someone
as
Henrietta
felt feel%2:37:00::
about
Charles
,
would
she
have
run_away run_away%2:38:00::
with
him
?
Impossible
to
imagine imagine%2:36:00::
Adelia
feeling feel%2:37:00::
so
about
anyone
.
No
temptation
,
no
sin
.
No
temptation
,
no
virtue
?
A
curious
thought
to
end end%2:42:01::
a
curious
night
.
The_birds
were be%2:42:03::
really
awake
now
in
a
colloquy
of
music
,
and
light
was
beginning begin%2:30:00::
to
creep creep%2:38:06::
across
the
room
,
touching touch%2:35:00::
sill
and
door
,
table
and
chair
and
all_of
Doaty
's
flowers
in
their
artificial
blossom
and
leaf
.
Before_anything_else
,
she
would
go go%2:38:00::
to
Doaty
's
grave
with
flowers
from
Doaty
's
forgotten
garden
.
Everything
must
wait wait%2:42:01::
upon
this
mission
,
this
sentimental
duty
of
a
pilgrim
whose
nature
avoided avoid%2:32:00::
graveyards
.
She
closed close%2:35:00::
her
eyes
,
remembering remember%2:31:02::
the
small
French
cemetery
,
enclosed
by
stone_walls
.
It
had
always
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
rain rain%2:43:00::
there
,
and
even
the
grass
was be%2:42:03::
gray
.
After
the
sad
impatient
moment
,
waiting wait%2:42:00::
for
comfort
which
could
not
come come%2:30:01::
,
she
slipped slip%2:38:01::
out_of_bed
and
went go%2:38:00::
to
the
open
window
.
The
garden
below
was be%2:42:03::
lacy
with
dew
and
enchanting
in
its
small
wildness
.
Leaning lean%2:38:00::
out
,
she
could
see see%2:39:00::
a
tangle
of
rosebush
and
honeysuckle
,
one
not_quite
come_to come_to%2:41:00::
bloom
,
one
just
beyond
it
.
On
a
thrusting
spray
thick_with
thorns
and
dewdrops
and
swelling
pink
buds
,
like
a
summer
Valentine
,
a
bird
balanced balance%2:35:00::
and
sang sing%2:36:00::
,
nondescriptly
brown
and
alive
with
its
own
music
,
a_little
engine
of
song
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
so
pretty
and
artless
that
she
felt feel%2:31:01::
like
a
child
again
and
would
have
enjoyed enjoy%2:37:00::
running_out run_out%2:38:02::
barefoot
to
play play%2:41:03::
on
the
wet
grass
with
all
the
growing
things
,
but
Doaty
never
permitted permit%2:32:00::
bare
feet
and
she
was be%2:42:03::
decidedly
not
a
child
but
une
femme
d
'
un
certain
age
.
Feeling feel%2:37:00::
suddenly
neat
and
subdued
,
she
dressed dress%2:29:00::
quite
soberly
and
went go%2:38:00::
downstairs
.
Rosa
,
unbelievably
,
was be%2:42:03::
not_yet
up
and
about
,
reassurance
that
Rosa
was be%2:42:03::
human
.
Feeling feel%2:37:00::
protective
toward
this
sleeping
being
,
Henrietta
found find%2:40:02::
a
yesterday
bun
and
milk
in
a
white
jug
,
a
breakfast
which
was be%2:42:06::
somewhat
the
equivalent
of
going go%2:38:00::
barefoot
.
Outside
,
the
garden
,
the
tame
wilderness
,
yielded yield%2:36:00::
a
patchwork
bouquet
of
daisies
,
sweet_william
,
scented
stock
and
lady
's
bedstraw
,
which
she
tied tie%2:35:00::
with
long
grasses
and
took take%2:38:10::
back
to
show show%2:39:02::
Rosa
,
who
was
now
stirring stir%2:38:00::
about
the
kitchen
and
haranguing harangue%2:32:00::
Folly
.
The
poodle
came come%2:38:00::
gleefully
to
Henrietta
and
begged beg%2:32:01::
for
the
flowers
,
supplicating supplicate%2:32:00::
the
air
with
prayerful
forepaws
.
Henrietta
held hold%2:42:00::;2:35:00::
her
bouquet
out_of_reach
and
said say%2:32:00::
it
was be%2:42:03::
for
Doaty
.
``
Rummaging rummage%2:35:00::
in
the
dew
''
,
said say%2:32:00::
Rosa
coldly
.
``
Go
change change%2:30:05::;2:30:03::
your
shoes
before
you
turn_around turn_around%2:38:00::
''
.
She
sounded sound%2:39:03::
so
exactly
like
Doaty
that
Henrietta
obeyed obey%2:41:00::
her
under
the
clear
impression
that
she
could
either
comply comply%2:41:00::
or
stay stay%2:38:00::
home
.
Folly
danced dance%2:38:01::
,
eager_for
whatever
lay lie%2:42:01::
beyond
the
door
.
To
a
Blackwell
,
there
was
only
one
church
.
The
cemetery
slumbered slumber%2:29:00::
just
behind
it
,
and
the
way
lay lie%2:42:00::
through
the
village
and
close_to
the
sea
.
For_the_first_time
in
thirty
years
,
Henrietta
walked walk%2:38:00::
down
the
narrow
street
with
its
shuttered
shops
just
stirring stir%2:38:00::
and
its
inhabitants
eying eye%2:39:00::
her
with
the
frankest
curiosity
.
She
smiled smile%2:29:00::
and
bowed bow%2:32:00::
,
recalling recall%2:31:00::
the
princess-in-a-carriage
feeling
she
had
enjoyed enjoy%2:37:00::
when
she
was be%2:42:06::
a
child
.
Now
,
some
of
the
acknowledgments
were be%2:42:03::
cautious
,
but
all
were be%2:42:03::
interested
.
An
old_man
,
sitting sit%2:35:00::
against
the
wall
of
a
cottage
and
waiting wait%2:42:00::
for
the
sun
to
find find%2:40:02::
him
,
gave give%2:32:00::
her
a
more_than
reflective
look
as
she
passed pass%2:38:00::
,
the
sap
still
plainly
rising rise%2:38:00::
in
his
branches
.
On
an
impulse
,
she
turned turn%2:38:00::
back
and
said say%2:32:00::
good_morning
.
He
cupped cup%2:30:00::
his
ear
and
shook shake%2:38:00::
his
head
at
her
repetition
,
announcing announce%2:32:00::
in
a
nettled
way
that
he
had
heard hear%2:39:00::
her
the
first
time
.
He
then
offered offer%2:40:02::
his
own
estimate
of
the
weather
,
which
was be%2:42:03::
unenthusiastic
.
``
Summer
's
been be%2:42:03::
slow
to
come come%2:38:04::
''
,
he
said say%2:32:00::
.
``
It
's be%2:42:06::
my
dryin_'_out

''
.
He
scowled scowl%2:29:00::
at
her
flowers
.
``
I
'm
taking take%2:38:09::
them
to
the
cemetery
''
,
said say%2:32:00::
Henrietta
,
out
of
a
vague
feeling
of
hospitality
.
``
They
'll
be
takin take%2:38:09::

,
he
said say%2:32:00::
pleasantly
,

He
regarded regard%2:39:00::
her
with
rising rise%2:30:00::
hope
.
``
You
'd

to

.
``
It
's

of
you
''
,
Henrietta
said say%2:32:00::
doubtfully
.
``
Y
're be%2:42:03::
welcome
''
.
He
straightened straighten%2:38:01::
himself
,
soldierly
against
the
wall
,
and
pulled pull%2:35:00::
his
sprawled
feet
together
so
they
stood stand%2:42:04::
side_by_side
in
their
old
boots
.
His
stick
ceased cease%2:42:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
a
thing
to
rest rest%2:35:01::
his
chin
on
and
became become%2:42:01::
a
pointer
for
emphasizing emphasize%2:32:00::
the
finer
aspects
of
his
text
.
``
Every_month

,
he
said say%2:32:00::
happily
,
``

.
Henrietta
murmured murmur%2:32:00::
that
she
could
quite
see see%2:31:01::
how
it
would
,
and
he
nodded nod%2:32:01::
approval
of
her
womanly
good_sense
.
``

he

He
looked look%2:39:00::
up
at
her
sharply
.
``
Do
n't

?
She
did
suddenly
,
through
the
link
of
memory
with
his
father
,
old
Titus
,
who
must
have
been be%2:42:03::
in
his
nineties
when
Henrietta
ran_away run_away%2:38:00::
.
Next
to
the
Blackwells
,
Titus
had
owned own%2:40:00::
the
island
most
,
and
she
and
Adelia
had
often
stood stand%2:42:03::
in
front
of
him
,
silenced silence%2:30:00::
by
his
terrible
years
-
a
scanty
man
with
a
thin
beard
and
very
deep-set
blue
eyes
like
a
mariner
,
more
aged
than
possible
.
He
had
never
spoken speak%2:32:00::
once
to
the
awed
sisters
,
but
his
son
had
been be%2:42:03::
friendly
,
a
big
fellow
of
fifty
or
more
,
a
fishing-boat
captain
and
powerful
like
the
sea
.
It
must
be be%2:42:06::
that
son
who
sat sit%2:35:00::
before
her
now
,
shriveled
to
half
his
size
and
half
his
senses
.
She
said say%2:32:00::
gently
,
``

``

dryly

at

knowingly

this

connivance
was be%2:42:03::
even_less

than
Selma_Cotter

Well

her

and
of_that

this

only

She
started start%2:30:00::

away

just_as

?
Henrietta
nodded nod%2:32:00::
.
How
much
they
knew know%2:31:03::
about
her
!
The
woman
(
she
must
have
been be%2:42:06::
a
tiny
baby
when
Hetty
and
Delia
had
stood stand%2:42:04::
arm
in
arm
,
watching watch%2:39:02::
great
age
grow grow%2:30:03::
small
)
answered answer%2:32:00::
the
nod
with
her
own
.
``
God
rest rest%2:32:01::
her
soul

she
was be%2:42:06::
a
sweet
one

Come come%2:38:00::
on
now
''
.
She
put put%2:35:00::
a
strong
hand
under
the
old_man
's
arm
and
lifted lift%2:38:00::
him
up
,
patiently
,
with
the
gentle
cruelty
and
necessary
tyranny
that
the
young
show show%2:32:02::
toward
the
very
old
.
He
mumbled mumble%2:32:00::
at
her
but
let let%2:41:00::
himself
be
led lead%2:38:01::
off
inside
the
house
,
shuffling shuffle%2:38:00::
mightily
to
make make%2:30:00::
it
clear
how
weak
and
aged
he
was be%2:42:03::
and_how
he
was
buffeted buffet%2:35:00::
about
by
those
who
still
had have%2:40:00::
their
wicked
strength
.
There
was be%2:42:04::
a
gabble
of
voices
from
indoors
,
young
hungry
sounds
like
cats
after
fish
,
and
a
burst
of
swearing
from
the
old_man
.
Henrietta
looked look%2:39:00::
down
at
her
bouquet
,
still
lively
with
its
color
and
scent
,
and
set set%2:30:01::
her
feet
on
their
journey
's
way
again
,
leaving leave%2:38:01::
the
village
street
and
crossing cross%2:38:00::
the
first
field
,
Folly
dancing dance%2:38:01::
ahead
of
her
.
At
the
edge
of
the
field
,
the
wild
rolling
land
took_over take_over%2:40:07::
,
dotted
with
fat
round
bushes
like
sheep
.
They
were
covered cover%2:42:01::
with
tiny
white
blossoms
,
their
scant
roots
clawing claw%2:35:01::
at
the
stony
ground
,
and
wild
birds
darted dart%2:38:01::
in
and
about
and
through
them
so
they
were be%2:42:03::
nearly
alive
with
the
rustle
and
cry
.
The
air
was be%2:42:03::
full
of
sounds
too
but
placid
ones
,
a
terrestrial
humming
as
much
out
of
the
earth
as
out_of_the_blue
sky
.
She
felt feel%2:37:00::
mindless
,
walking walk%2:38:00::
,
and
almost
easy
until
the
church
spire
told tell%2:32:00::
her
she
was be%2:42:05::
near
the
cemetery
,
and
she
caught catch%2:39:01::
herself
wondering wonder%2:32:01::
what
she
would
say say%2:32:00::
to
Doaty
.
Both
church
and
graveyard
were be%2:42:03::
smaller
than
she
remembered remember%2:31:00::
them
(
how
many
things
had
lessened lessen%2:30:00::
while
she
was be%2:42:03::
gone
away
)
but
the
headstones
had
grown grow%2:30:03::
so
thick
in
thirty
years
that
to
find find%2:40:00::
one
named name%2:32:03::
``
Dorothy_Tredding
''
seemed seem%2:39:00::
suddenly
impossible
.
She
sat_down sit_down%2:38:00::
on
the
nearest
,
fallen
with
age
and
gray
with
sea-damp
,
her
fingers
tracing trace%2:35:00::
the
indecipherable
carved
letters
padded
with
green
moss
.
The
day
's
sun
was
gathering gather%2:35:00::
its
strength
in
gold
,
and
she
wished wish%2:37:02::
she
had
brought bring%2:38:00::
her
parasol
,
if
only
to
shade shade%2:43:00::
Doaty
's
flowers
.
A
small
,
rock-carved
angel
watched watch%2:41:00::
her
from
a
nearby
tomb
,
the
only
angel
in
the
cemetery
.
She
remembered remember%2:31:00::
,
suddenly
,
a
night
of
savage
moonlight
and
scudding
clouds
when
she
and
Adelia
,
having
dared dare%2:32:00::
each
other
,
had
stolen steal%2:38:00::
out
of
their
great
safe
house
and
come come%2:38:00::
here
,
hand_in_hand
,
hoping hope%2:31:00::
and
fearing fear%2:37:00::
ghosts
.
