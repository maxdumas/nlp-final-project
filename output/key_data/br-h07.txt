However

a
word
should
be

in

them

There

The
remaining
twelve
states
have have%2:42:00::
varying
fiscal_years
for
the
state

city

local_governments
.
However
,
only
Illinois
,
Oregon
,
Louisiana
and
Rhode_Island
have have%2:42:00::
a
situation
in_which
the
sundry
units
of
government
vary vary%2:42:00::
widely
in_relation_to
fiscal
uniformity
.
An
excellent
summary
of
advantages
concerning concern%2:42:00::
the
uniform
fiscal_year
and
coordinated
fiscal
calendars
was
contained contain%2:42:00::
in
a
paper
presented present%2:32:02::
by
a
public
finance
authority
recently
.
He
listed list%2:32:00::
among
the
values
of
fiscal
uniformity
:
The
uniform
fiscal_year
requires require%2:42:00::
compliance
with
common_sense
administration
of
local
finances
:
adoption
of
the
budget
,
or
financial
plan
,
in_advance
of
spending
.
The
uniform
fiscal_year
ensures ensure%2:32:00::
conformance
with
another
common_sense
rule
,
that
of
having have%2:40:00::
cash
in
the
bank
before
checks
are
drawn draw%2:40:01::
.
It
enables enable%2:30:00::
towns
to
make make%2:41:00::
more
economical
purchases
and
to
take_advantage take_advantage%2:40:00::
of
cash
discounts
.
The
uniform
fiscal_year
promotes promote%2:41:01::
more
careful
budgeting
and
strengthens strengthen%2:30:01::
control
over
expenditures
.
By
fixing fix%2:32:03::
the
tax_rate
in_advance
of
spending
,
upper_limits
are
set set%2:32:00::
on
expenditures
.
The
uniform
fiscal_year
brings bring%2:35:04::
the
town
's
fiscal_year
into
line
with_that
of
the
schools
,
which
expend expend%2:40:00::
the
largest
share
of
local
disbursements
.
This
greatly
simplifies simplify%2:30:01::
the
town
's
bookkeeping
and
financial
reporting
.
The
uniform
fiscal_year
eliminates eliminate%2:30:01::
interest
charges
on
money
borrowed borrow%2:40:00::
in
the
form
of
tax
anticipation
notes
.
Furthermore
,
tax_collections
not
immediately
needed need%2:34:00::
for
current
expenditures
may
be
invested invest%2:40:00::
in
short-term
treasury_notes
,
augmenting augment%2:30:01::
the
town
's
miscellaneous
revenues
and
reducing reduce%2:30:00::
the
tax
levy
.
The
uniform
fiscal_year
facilitates facilitate%2:30:00::
inter-town
comparison
of
revenues
and
expenditures
.
When
towns
have have%2:42:00::
the
same
fiscal_year
it
is be%2:42:03::
relatively
easy
to
make make%2:41:00::
meaningful
comparisons
;
and
as
the
cost
of
local_government
increases increase%2:30:00::
,
the
demand
for
such
comparison
also
increases increase%2:30:00::
.
Towns
having have%2:42:00::
different
fiscal_years
are be%2:42:03::
difficult
to
compare compare%2:31:00::
.
Of
all
advantages
,
probably
none
is be%2:42:03::
more
important
than
the
elimination
of
tax
anticipation
notes
.
Borrowing borrow%2:40:00::
in
anticipation
of
current
taxes
and
other
revenues
is be%2:42:03::
a
routine
procedure
of
the
majority
of
municipalities
at_all_times
.
It
may
be be%2:42:04::
by
bank
loans
,
sale
of
notes
or
warrants
,
or
by
the
somewhat
casual
method
of
issuance
and
registration
of
warrants
.
In_any_event
it
is be%2:42:06::
a
form
of
borrowing
which
could
be
and
should
be
rendered render%2:30:00::
unnecessary
.
Its
elimination
would
result result%2:42:02::
in
the
saving
of
interest
costs
,
heavy
when
short-term
money
rates
are be%2:42:03::
high
,
and
in
freedom
from
dependence
on
credit
which
is be%2:42:03::
not
always
available
when
needed need%2:42:00::
most
.
This
type
of
borrowing
can
be
reduced reduce%2:30:00::
to
a
minimum
if
quarterly
installment
payment
of
taxes
is
instituted institute%2:36:00::
and
the
first
payment
placed place%2:35:00::
near
the
opening
of
the
fiscal_year
.
Any
approach
toward
such
a
system
looks look%2:31:00::
toward
saving
and
security
.
It
should
be
noted note%2:32:00::
that
there
are
other
and
equally
important
reasons
for
establishing establish%2:41:00::
meaningful
intergovernmental
reporting
bases
on
a
uniform
fiscal_year
.
Both
the
federal
and
state_governments
commence commence%2:30:01::
their
fiscal_years
on
July_1
.
Both
units
of
government
contribute contribute%2:40:02::
increasingly
large
sums_of_money
to
the
several
local_governments
in_this
state
as
indicated indicate%2:32:00::
below
:
It
has
been
said say%2:32:01::
that
when
local_government
revenues
were
mostly
produced produce%2:36:02::
locally
from
the
property_tax
,
the
lack
of
a
uniform
fiscal_year
was be%2:42:03::
no
great
handicap
;
but
with
the
growth
of
state
and
federal
fiscal
aid
,
the
emphasis
on
equalization
,
and
the
state-local
sharing
of
responsibility
for_certain
important
functions
,
this
is be%2:42:03::
no_longer
true
.
The
haphazard
fiscal_year
calendar
is be%2:42:06::
an
obstacle
to
the
planning
of
clear
and
efficient
state-local
revenue
and
expenditure
relationships
.
Although
there
are
many
sound
reasons
for
adopting adopt%2:40:02::
uniform
and
coordinated
fiscal_years
in
Rhode_Island
,
there
are
also
certain
difficulties
encountered encounter%2:42:00::
.
These
involve involve%2:42:01::
more
the
mechanics
employed employ%2:34:00::
in
adjusting adjust%2:30:02::
to
fiscal
uniformity
than
they
do
actual
actual
disadvantages
to
the
principle
.
One
problem
is be%2:42:06::
a
matter
of
shifting shift%2:30:01::
dates
;
the
other
,
is be%2:42:06::
how
to
finance finance%2:40:00::
the
transition
.
Little
can
be
done do%2:41:01::
about
the
changing
of
dates
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
an
inherent
part
of
adjusting adjust%2:30:00::
fiscal
calendars
.
It
usually
means mean%2:42:00::
a
confused
and
disgruntled
tax-paying
public
for
a
period_of_time
.
But
cooperation
and
understanding
between
local
officials
and
the
citizenry
help help%2:41:00::
lessen lessen%2:30:00::
this
problem
.
The
other
problem
is be%2:42:06::
the_matter
of
financing finance%2:40:00::
the
transition
period
in
the
several
cities
and
towns
.
This
will
be
covered cover%2:32:01::
more
fully
later
.
It
should
be
kept keep%2:42:00::
in
mind
that
the
ease
or
difficulty
with
which
a
town
or
city
can
convert convert%2:30:00::
to
the
proposed
plan
is be%2:42:03::
directly
dependent
upon
the
financial_condition
of_that
town
or
city
.
Fortunately
,
there
are
no
cities
or
towns
in
the
state
,
with
one
or
two
possible
exceptions
that
are be%2:42:03::
in
too
difficult
a
position
to
finance finance%2:40:00::
the
proposed
change
.
Sacrifice
will
have have%2:42:05::
to
be
made make%2:41:00::
in
some
cases
,
but
it
is be%2:42:03::
to
the
municipality
's
advantage
to
finance finance%2:40:00::
the
change-over
for
a
short
period_of_time
rather_than
pay pay%2:40:00::
interest
on
tax
anticipation
notes
indefinitely
.
The
advantages
of
a
uniform
fiscal_year
and
well
synchronized
fiscal
and
tax_collection
calendars
are be%2:42:03::
sufficiently
great
for
Rhode_Island
municipalities
to
exert exert%2:34:00::
effort
to
secure secure%2:40:00::
them
.
The
type
of
program
desired desire%2:37:02::
can
be
determined determine%2:32:00::
by
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
adjustments
needed need%2:42:00::
.
Two
features
are be%2:42:03::
immediately
evident
.
First
,
the
present
situation
is be%2:42:03::
too
varied
to
be
systematized systematize%2:30:00::
by
any
single
formula
.
Second
,
the
shift
to
a
uniform
July_1
-
June
30
fiscal_year
will
,
of
itself
,
improve improve%2:30:01::
the
tax_collection
calendars
of
the
great
majority
of
cities
and
towns
.
There
are
at_least
two
problems
to
consider consider%2:39:00::
:
one
is be%2:42:06::
a
matter
of
adjusting adjust%2:30:00::
the
fiscal
calendar
;
the
other
is be%2:42:06::
how
to
finance finance%2:40:00::
the
adjustments
when
necessary
.
The
latter
matter
is
considered consider%2:39:00::
in_detail
in
a
later
section
.
Twelve
cities
and
towns
in
Rhode_Island
presently
indicate indicate%2:32:00::
some
plans
to
establish establish%2:41:00::
a
uniform
and
/
or
coordinated
fiscal-tax
year
calendar
.
Plans
vary vary%2:42:00::
from
the
``
talking
stage
''
to
establishing establish%2:41:00::
special
committees
to
accomplish accomplish%2:36:00::
this
end
.
What
is be%2:42:03::
important
here
is be%2:42:06::
that
many_of
the
cities
and
towns
recognize recognize%2:31:01::
the
need
for
improved
fiscal
practices
and
are
taking take%2:41:04::
the
initiative
to
obtain obtain%2:40:00::
them
.
An
analysis
of
the
fiscal-tax
collection
year
calendars
throughout
the
state
indicates indicate%2:32:01::
that
transition
may
not
be be%2:42:03::
as
painful
as
is
commonly
thought think%2:31:03::
.
However
,
it
must
be
stressed stress%2:32:00::
that_much
depends_upon depend_upon%2:42:00::
the
financial_condition
of
the
individual
cities
and
towns
involved
.
The
adjustments
needed need%2:42:00::
to
establish establish%2:41:00::
a
uniform
and
coordinated
fiscal-tax
collection
year
calendar
throughout
Rhode_Island
,
based base%2:31:00::
on
a
July_1
-
June
30
year
,
are
shown show%2:36:00::
below
.
Six
cities
and
towns
are be%2:42:03::
presently
on
a
July_1
-
June
30
fiscal_year
and
have
coordinated coordinate%2:41:00::
their
tax_collection
year
with_it
.
No
change
is
required require%2:42:00::
for
these
towns
.
These
municipalities
include include%2:42:00::
:
Barrington
,
Lincoln
,
Middletown
,
Newport
,
North_Kingstown
,
and
South_Kingstown
.
One
town
and
one
city
,
Coventry
and
East_Providence
,
require require%2:42:00::
an
adjustment
of
their
fiscal_year
only
.
This
change
will
automatically
adjust adjust%2:30:00::
their
tax_collection
year
calendar
so_as_to
make make%2:30:00::
all
tax
installments
due
and
payable
in
the
fiscal_year
collectible
within
that
year
.
Six
cities
and
towns
are be%2:42:03::
now
on
a
July_1
-
June
30
fiscal_year
and
will
need need%2:42:01::
only
to
adjust adjust%2:30:00::
their
tax_collection
year
calendar
to
establish establish%2:41:00::
uniformity
.
These
cities
and
towns
include include%2:42:00::
Bristol
,
Glocester
,
Pawtucket
,
Cumberland
,
Central_Falls
,
and
Woonsocket
.
Two
cities
to
be
considered consider%2:39:00::
,
Providence
and
Cranston
,
are be%2:42:03::
an
enigma
.
Both
have have%2:42:00::
excellent
integration
of
their
fiscal-tax
collection
year
calendars
.
However
,
neither
of
these
two
cities
is be%2:42:03::
on
the
desired
July_1
-
June
30
fiscal_year
.
The
adjustment
to
a
uniform
and
coordinated
fiscal
period
could
be
accomplished accomplish%2:36:00::
relatively
easy
for
them
.
In_that
both
cities
end end%2:30:01::
their
fiscal_years
on
September
30
,
they
could
levy levy%2:40:00::
taxes
for
an
interim
period
of
nine
months
,
commencing commence%2:30:00::
with
September
30
and
ending end%2:42:00::
with
June
30
.
These
three
installment
dates
would
be be%2:42:06::
:
October
26
,
January
26
,
and
April
25
(
Providence
)
and
November
15
,
February
16
and
May
15
(
Cranston
)
.
Both
would
start start%2:30:01::
their
new
fiscal_year
on
July_1
.
Their
tax_collection
calendar
could
then
be be%2:42:06::
:
July
25
,
October
26
,
January
26
,
and
April
25
,
(
Providence
)
;
and
August
15
,
November
15
,
February
17
,
and
May
15
,
(
Cranston
)
.
Under
this
plan
both
Cranston
and
Providence
would
be be%2:42:03::
on
the
uniform
fiscal_year
but
would
still
be
using use%2:34:01::
the
same
installment
periods
.
The
remaining
twenty-three
towns
have have%2:42:00::
fiscal_years
which
end end%2:42:00::
prior
to
June
30
.
All_of
these
towns
will
require require%2:42:00::
adjustments
of
both
their
fiscal
and
tax_collection
years
.
Assuming assume%2:31:00::
an
adjustment
to
the
July_1
-
June
30
fiscal_year
,
the
required
adjustment
of
the
tax_collection
years
and
the
towns
involved involve%2:42:01::
are
shown show%2:36:00::
in
Table
3
.
Aside
from
the_matter
of
adjusting adjust%2:30:00::
the
fiscal
and
tax
calendars
,
there
is
the
problem
of
financing finance%2:40:00::
the
adjustment
when
this
is be%2:42:03::
necessary
.
It
should
be
emphasized emphasize%2:32:00::
strongly
that
adjustments
in
