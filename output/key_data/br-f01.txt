In
American
romance
,
almost
nothing
rates rate%2:42:01::
higher
than
what
the
movie
men
have
called call%2:32:00::
``
meeting
cute
''
-
that_is
,
boy-meets-girl
seems seem%2:39:00::
more
adorable
if
it
does
n't
take_place take_place%2:30:00::
in
an
atmosphere
of
correct
and
acute
boredom
.
Just_about
the_most
enthralling
real-life
example
of
meeting
cute
is be%2:42:06::
the
Charles_MacArthur-Helen_Hayes
saga
:
reputedly
all
he
did do%2:41:01::
was be%2:42:06::
give give%2:40:00::
her
a
handful
of
peanuts
,
but
he
said say%2:32:00::
simultaneously
,
``
I
wish wish%2:32:02::
they
were be%2:42:06::
emeralds
''
.
Aside
from
the
comico-romantico
content
here
,
a
good
linguist-anthropologist
could
readily
pick_up pick_up%2:31:00::
a_few
other
facts
,
especially
if
he
had have%2:40:00::
a_little
more
of
the
conversation
to
go_on go_on%2:42:00::
.
The
way
MacArthur
said say%2:32:00::
his
line
-
if
you
had have%2:40:00::
the
recorded
transcript
of
a
professional
linguist
-
would
probably
have
gone go%2:42:02::
like
this
:
Primary
stresses
on
emeralds
and
wish
;
note
pitch
3
(
pretty
high
)
on
emeralds
but
with
a
slight
degree
of
drawl
,
one
degree
of
oversoftness
.
Conclusions
:
The
people
involved
(
and
subsequent
facts
bear bear_out%2:42:00::
me
out
here
)
knew know%2:31:01::
clearly
the
relative
values
of
peanuts
and
emeralds
,
both
monetary
and
sentimental
.
And
the
drawling
,
oversoft
voice
of
flirtation
,
though
fairly
overt
,
was be%2:42:03::
still
well
within
the
prescribed
gambit
of
their
culture
.
In_other_words
,
like
automation
machines
designed design%2:31:00::
to
work work%2:35:02::
in
tandem
,
they
shared share%2:42:00::
the
same
programming
,
a
mutual_understanding
not_only
of
English
words
,
but
of
the
four
stresses
,
pitches
,
and
junctures
that
can
change change%2:30:01::
their
meaning
from
black
to
white
.
At
this
point
,
unfortunately
,
romance
becomes become%2:30:00::
a
regrettably
small
part
of
the
picture
;
but
consider consider%2:31:01::
,
if
you
can
bear bear%2:31:00::
it
,
what
might
have
happened happen%2:30:00::
if
MacArthur
,
for
some
perverse
,
undaunted
reason
,
had
made make%2:41:00::
the
same
remark
to
an
Eskimo
girl
in
Eskimo
.
To
her
peanuts
and
emeralds
would
have
been be%2:42:08::
just_so
much
blubber
.
The
point
-
quite
simply
-
is be%2:42:06::
this
:
words
they
might
have
had have%2:40:00::
;
but
communication
,
no
.
This
basic_principle
,
the
first
in
a
richly
knotted
bundle
,
was
conveyed convey%2:32:00::
to
me
by
Dr._Henry_Lee_Smith
,
Jr.
,
at
the
University
of
Buffalo
,
where
he
heads head%2:41:00::
the
world
's
first
department_of_anthropology
and
linguistics
.
A
brisk
,
amusing
man
,
apparently
constructed construct%2:36:01::
on
an
ingenious
system
of
spring-joints
attuned attune%2:30:00::
to
the
same
peppery
rhythm
as
his
mind
,
Smith
began begin%2:36:00::
his
academic
career
teaching teach%2:32:00::
speech
to
Barnard
girls
-
a
project
considerably
enlivened enliven%2:30:00::
by
his
devotion
to
a
recording
about
``
a
young
rat
named
Arthur
,
who
never
could
make_up make_up_one's_mind%2:31:00::
his
mind
''
.
Later
,
he
became become%2:30:00::
one
of
the
central
spirits
of
the
Army
Language
Program
and
the
language_school
of
Washington
's
Foreign_Service_Institute
.
It
was be%2:42:05::
there
,
in
the
course
of
trying try%2:41:00::
to

new

for
the
``

in
remote

posts
,
that
he
first
began begin%2:30:00::
to
develop develop%2:36:00::
a
system
of
charting chart%2:31:13::
the
``
norms
of
human
communication
''
.
To
the
trained
ear
of
the
linguist
,
talk
has
always
revealed reveal%2:32:00::
a
staggering
quantity
of
information
about
the
talker
-
such
things
as
geographical
origin
and
/
or
history
,
socio-economic
identity
,
education
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
only
fairly
recently
,
however
,
that
linguists
have
developed develop%2:36:00::
a
systematic
way
of
charting chart%2:31:13::
voices
on_paper
in_a_way
that
tells tell%2:32:00::
even
more
about
the
speakers
and
about
the
success
or
failure
of
human
communication
between
two
people
.
This
,
for
obvious
reasons
,
makes make%2:30:00::
their
techniques
superbly
useful
in
studying study%2:31:02::
the
psychiatric

In
the
early
1950
's
,
Smith
,
together
with
his
distinguished
colleague
,
George_Trager
(
so
austerely
academic
he
sometimes
fights fight%2:33:01::
his
own
evident
charm
)
,
and
a
third
man
with
the
engaging
name
of
Birdwhistell
(
Ray
)
,
agreed agree%2:32:00::
on
some
basic
premises
about
the
three-part
process
that
makes make%2:36:00::
communication
:
(
1
)
words
or
language
(
2
)
paralanguage
,
a
set
of
phenomena
including include%2:42:00::
laughing
,
weeping
,
voice
breaks
,
and
``
tone
''
of
voice
,
and
(

)
kinesics
,
the
technical
name
for
gestures
,
facial_expressions
,
and
body
shifts
-
nodding nod%2:32:00::
or
shaking shake%2:38:02::
the
head
,
``
talking talk%2:32:00::
''
with
one
's
hands
,
et
cetera
.
Smith
's
first
workout
with
stresses
,
pitches
,
and
junctures
was
based base%2:31:00::
on
mother
,
which
spells spell%2:32:01::
,
in
our
culture
,
a
good_deal
more_than
bread
alone
.
For_example
,
if
you
are be%2:42:06::
a
reasonably
well-adjusted
person
,
there
are be%2:42:03::
certain
ways
that
are be%2:42:03::
reasonable
and
appropriate
for
addressing address%2:32:00::
your
mother
.
The
usual
U._S.
norm
would
be be%2:42:06::
:
Middle
pitches
,
slight
pause
(
juncture
)
before
mother
,
slight
rise
at
the
end
.
The
symbols
of
mother
's
status
,
here
,
are be%2:42:03::
all
usual
for
culture
U._S._A.
.
Quite
other
feelings
are
evidenced evidence%2:32:02::
by
this
style
:
Note note%2:39:02::
the
drop
to
pitch
1
(
the
lowest
)
on
mother
with
no
rise
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
;
this
is be%2:42:06::
a
``
fade
''
ending
,
and
what
you
have have%2:40:00::
here
is be%2:42:06::
a
downtalking
style
of
speech
,
expressing express%2:32:02::
something
less_than
conventional
respect
for
mother
.
Even_less
regard
for
mom
and
mom
's
apple_pie
goes_with go_with%2:42:01::
:
In_other_words
,
the
way
the
speaker
relates relate%2:41:00::
to
mother
is
clearly
indicated indicate%2:32:01::
.
And
while
the
meaning
of
the
words
is
not
in_this
instance
altered alter%2:30:01::
,
the
quality
of
communication
in
both
the
second
and
third
examples
is
definitely
impaired impair%2:30:01::
.
An
accompanying
record
of
paralanguage
factors
for
the
second
example
might
also
note note%2:32:01::
a
throaty
rasp
.
With
this
seven-word
sentence
-
though
the
speaker
undoubtedly
thought think%2:31:03::
he
was
dealing deal%2:32:08::
only
with
the
subject
of
food
-
he
was
telling tell%2:32:00::
things
about
himself
and
,
in
the
last
two
examples
,
revealing reveal%2:32:00::
that
he
had
departed depart%2:42:00::
from
the
customs
of
his
culture
.
The
joint
investigations
of
linguistics
and
psychiatry
have
established establish%2:31:00::
,
in_point_of_fact
,
that
no_matter
what
the
subject
of
conversation
is be%2:42:06::
or
what
words
are_involved
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
impossible
for
people
to
talk talk%2:32:00::
at_all
without
telling tell%2:32:00::
over_and_over_again
what
sort_of
people
they
are be%2:42:06::
and_how
they
relate relate%2:41:00::
to
the
rest
of
the
world
.
Since
interviewing
is be%2:42:06::
the
basic
therapeutic
and
diagnostic
instrument
of
modern
psychiatry
,
the
recording
of
interviews
for
playbacks
and
study
has
been be%2:42:06::
a
boost
of
Redstone
proportions
in
new
research
and
training
.
Some
of
the
earliest
recordings
,
made make%2:36:00::
in
the
1940
's
,
demonstrated demonstrate%2:39:00::
that
psychiatrists
reacted react%2:31:00::
immediately
to
anger
and
anxiety
in
the
sound
track
,
whereas
written_records
of
the
same
interview
offered offer%2:40:02::
far
fewer
cues
to
therapy
which
-
if
they
were be%2:42:03::
at_all
discernible
in
print
-
were
picked_up pick_up%2:31:00::
only
by
the_most
skilled
and
sensitive
experts
.
In
a
general
way
,
psychiatrists
were be%2:42:03::
able
to
establish establish%2:31:00::
on
a
wide
basis
what
many_of
them
had
always
felt feel%2:31:00::
-
that
the_most
telling
cues
in
psychotherapy
are be%2:42:03::
acoustic
,
that
such
things
as
stress
and
nagging
are
transmitted transmit%2:40:10::
by
sound
alone
and
not
necessarily
by
words
.
At
a
minimum
,
recording
-
usually
on
tape
,
which
is be%2:42:03::
now
in
wide
professional
use
-

are be%2:42:06::
the
experts
in

have
carried carry%2:41:00::

By
adding add%2:30:00::
a
systematic
analysis

symbols
to
the
typed
transcripts
of
interviews
,
they
have
supplied supply%2:40:00::

may

to
light
underlying
psychological
difficulties
,
making make%2:30:00::
them
apparent
first
to
the
therapist
and
eventually
to
the
patient
.
In
one
now-historic
first
interview
,
for_example
,
the
transcript
(
reproduced reproduce%2:36:00::
from
the
book
,
The
First
Five
Minutes
)
goes go%2:42:02::
like
this
:
The
therapist
's
level
tone
is be%2:42:03::
bland
and
neutral
-
he
has
,
for_example
,
avoided avoid%2:41:03::
stressing stress%2:32:01::
``
you
''
,
which
would
imply imply%2:32:00::
disapproval
;
or
surprise
,
which
would
set set_apart%2:30:01::
the
patient
apart
from
other
people
.
The
patient
,
on_the_other_hand
,
is be%2:42:03::
far
from
neutral
;
aside
from
her
specifically
regional
accent
,
she
reveals reveal%2:32:00::
by
the
use
of
the
triad
,
``
irritable
,
tense
,
depressed
''
,
a
certain
pedantic
itemization
that
indicates indicate%2:32:01::
she
has have%2:40:00::
some
familiarity
with
literary
or
scientific
language
(
i.
e.
,
she
must
have
had have%2:40:00::
at_least
a
high-school
education
)
,
and
she
is
telling tell%2:32:01::
a
story
she
has
mentally
rehearsed rehearse%2:36:00::
some
time
before
.
Then
she
catapults_into
``
everything
and
everybody
''
,
putting put%2:34:00::
particular
violence
on
``
everybody
''
,
indicating indicate%2:32:01::
to
the
linguist
that
this
is be%2:42:06::
a
spot
to
flag flag%2:30:00::
-
that_is
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
not
congruent
to
the
patient
's
general
style
of
speech
up_to
this
point
.
Consequently
,
it
is
referred refer%2:38:00::
to
the
therapist
for
attention
.
He
may
then
very_well
conclude conclude%2:31:00::
that
``
everybody
''
is be%2:42:06::
probably
not
the
true
target
of
her
resentment
.
Immediately
thereafter
,
the
patient
fractures fracture%2:30:01::
her
rehearsed
story
,
veering veer%2:38:00::
into
an
oversoft
,
breathy
,
sloppily
articulated articulate%2:32:00::
,
``
I
do
n't
feel_like feel_like%2:37:00::
talking talk%2:32:01::
right_now
''
.
Within
the
first
five
minutes
of_this
interview
it
is be%2:42:03::
apparent
to
the
therapist
that
``
everybody
''
truthfully
refers refer%2:32:01::
to
the
woman
's
husband
.
She
says say%2:32:00::
later
,
but
still
within
the
opening
five
minutes
,
``
I
keep keep%2:42:07::
thinking_of think_of%2:31:03::
a
divorce
but
that
's
another
emotional
death
''
.
The
linguistic
and
paralinguistic
signals
of
misery
are be%2:42:03::
all
present
in
the
voice
chart
for
this
sentence
;
so
are be%2:42:03::
certain
signals
that
she
does
not
accept accept%2:31:01::
divorce
.
By
saying say%2:32:00::
``
another
emotional
death
''
,
she
reveals reveal%2:32:00::
that
there
has
been be%2:42:00::
a
previous
one
,
although
she
has
not
described describe%2:32:00::
it
in
words
.
This
the
therapist
may
pursue pursue%2:41:01::
in
later
questioning
.
The
phrase
,
``
emotional
death
''
,
interesting
and
,
to
a
non-scientific
mind
,
rather
touching
,
suggests suggest%2:32:02::
that
this
woman
may
have have%2:40:00::
some
flair
for
words
,
perhaps
even
something
of
the
temperament
regrettably
called
``
creative
''
.
Since
the
psychiatric
interview
,
like
any
other
interview
,
depends_on depend_on%2:42:00::
communication
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
significant
to
note note%2:32:00::
that
the
therapist
in_this
interview
was be%2:42:06::
a
man
of
marked
skill
and
long
experience
.
His
own
communication
apparatus
operated operate%2:35:03::
superbly
,
and
Lillian_Ross
readers
will
note note%2:39:00::
instantly
its
total
lack
of
resemblance
to
the
blunted
,
monumentally
unmeshed
mechanism
of
Dr._Blauberman
.
Interestingly
enough
-
although
none
of
the
real-life
therapists
involved involve%2:42:01::
could
conceivably
compare compare%2:42:00::
with
Blauberman
-
when
groups
of
them
began begin%2:30:00::
playing_back play_back%2:36:00::
interviews
,
they
discovered discover%2:36:00::
any
number
of
ways
in_which
they
wanted want%2:37:00::
to
polish polish%2:30:01::
their
own
interview
techniques
;
almost
everyone
,
on
first
hearing hear%2:39:00::
one
of
his
own
sessions
on
tape
,
expressed express%2:32:00::
some
desire
to
take take_over%2:41:02::
the
whole_thing
over_again
.
Yet
,
in_spite_of
this
,
intensive
study
of
the
taped
interviews
by
teams
of
psychotherapists
and
linguists
laid_bare
the
