Some
recent
writings
assume assume%2:31:00::
that
the
ignorant
young
couples
are be%2:42:03::
a
thing
of
the
remote
,
Victorian
past
;
that
nowadays
all
honeymooners
are be%2:42:03::
thoroughly
familiar_with
the
best
sex-manuals
and
know know%2:31:01::
enough
from
talk
with
friends
and
personal
experimentation
to
take
all
the
anxiety
and
hazards
out
of
the
situation
.
Perhaps
-
but
extensive
discussions
with
contemporary
practitioners
,
family_doctors
and
gynecologists
indicate indicate%2:32:02::
that
this
is be%2:42:06::
still
an
area
of
enormous
ignorance
.
Joking
and
talking
may
be be%2:42:03::
freer
and
easier
,
but
the
important
factual
information
is be%2:42:03::
still
lacking
for
far
too
many
newly-married
men
and
women
.
Various
factors
in
the
setting
can
still
be be%2:42:03::
of
great
advantage
in
making make%2:30:00::
the
first
intercourse
a
good
rather_than
a
bad
memory
for
one
or
both
.
Privacy
must
be
highly
assured assure%2:31:00::
both
in_time
and
place
.
That_is
,
locking lock%2:35:00::
the
room
or
stateroom
door
gives give%2:40:05::
privacy
of
location
,
but
it
is be%2:42:03::
equally
important
to
be be%2:42:03::
sure
there
is be%2:42:00::
time
enough
for
an
utterly
unhurried
fulfillment
.
If
the
wedding_party
lasted last%2:42:00::
late
,
and
the
travel
schedule
means mean%2:42:00::
there
are be%2:42:00::
only
a_few
hours
before
resuming resume%2:30:00::
the
trip
or
making make%2:41:00::
an
early
start
,
the
husband
may
forestall forestall%2:41:01::
tensions
and
uncertainties
by
confiding confide%2:32:00::
to
his
bride
that
lying lie%2:38:00::
in
each
other
's
arms
will
be be%2:42:03::
bliss
enough
for
these
few
hours
.
The
consummation
should
come come%2:30:01::
at
the
next
stopping
place
when
they
have have%2:40:00::
a
long
private
time
(
day
or
night
)
for
that
purpose
.
First
intercourse
for
the
bride
brings bring%2:35:04::
with
it
the
various
problems
connected connect%2:35:00::
with
virginity
and
the
hymen
.
One
thing
should
be be%2:42:03::
clear
to
both
husband
and
wife
-
neither
pain
nor
profuse
bleeding
has_to
occur occur%2:30:00::
when
the
hymen
is
ruptured rupture%2:35:00::
during
the
first
sex_act
.
Ignorance
on
this
point
has
caused cause%2:36:00::
a
great_deal
of
needless
anxiety
,
misunderstanding
and
suspicion
.
The
hymen
is be%2:42:06::
,
in_essence
,
a
fragile
membrane
that
more_or_less
completely
covers cover%2:35:00::
the
entrance
to
the
vagina
in
most
female
human_beings
who
have
not
had have%2:39:06::
sex
relations
.
(
Hymen
,
in_fact
,
is be%2:42:06::
the
Greek
word
for
membrane
.
)
Often
it
is be%2:42:03::
thin
and
fragile
and
gives_way give_way%2:38:01::
readily
to
the
male
organ
at
the
first
attempt
at
intercourse
.
As_might_be_expected
,
girls
in_this
situation
bleed bleed%2:29:00::
very
little
and
perhaps
not_at_all
in
the
process
of
losing lose%2:40:02::
their
virginity
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
also
important
to
realize realize%2:31:01::
that
many
girls
are_born be_born%2:30:00::
without
a
hymen
or
at_most
only
a
tiny
trace
of
one
;
so_that
the
absence
of
the
hymen
is be%2:42:06::
by_no_means
positive
proof
that
a
girl
has
had have%2:39:06::
sex
relations
.
But
there
is be%2:42:00::
a
basis
in_fact
for
the
exaggerations
of
the
folk-lore
beliefs
.
Some
hymens
are be%2:42:03::
so
strongly
developed
that
they
cannot
be
torn tear%2:35:00::
without
considerable
pain
to
the
girl
and
marked
loss
of
blood
.
More
rarely
,
the
hymen
is be%2:42:03::
so
sturdy
that
it
does
not
yield yield%2:30:00::
to
penetration
.
Extreme
cases
are be%2:42:03::
on
record
in_which
the
doctor
has
had
to
use use%2:34:01::
instruments
to
cut cut%2:35:00::
through
the
hymen
to
permit permit%2:41:00::
marital
relations_to
be
consummated consummate%2:36:01::
.
These
cases
,
for
all
their
rarity
,
are be%2:42:03::
so
dramatic
that
friends
and
relations
repeat repeat%2:32:00::
the
story
until
the
general
population
may
get get%2:39:00::
an
entirely
false
notion
of
how
often
the
hymen
is be%2:42:03::
a
serious
problem
to
newly-weds
.
In_recent_times
,
when
sexual
matters
began begin%2:30:00::
to
be
discussed discuss%2:32:00::
more
scientifically
and
more
openly
,
the
emotional
aspects
of
virginity
received receive%2:30:01::
considerable
attention
.
Obviously
,
the
bridal
pair
has have%2:39:06::
many
adjustments
to
make make%2:41:00::
to
their
new
situation
.
Is
it
necessary
to
add add%2:30:00::
to
the
other
tensions
the
hazard
of
making make%2:30:00::
the
loving
husband
the
one
who
brought bring%2:36:00::
pain
to
his
bride
?
Gynecologists
and
marriage
manuals
began begin%2:30:00::
to
advise advise%2:32:00::
that
the
bride
should
consult consult%2:32:02::
a
physician
before
marriage
.
If
he
foresaw foresee%2:36:00::
any
problem
because
of
the
quality
of
the
hymen
,
it
was
recommended recommend%2:32:01::
that
simple
procedures
be
undertaken undertake%2:36:00::
at_once
to
incise incise%2:35:00::
the
hymen
or
,
preferably
,
to
dilate dilate%2:30:01::
it
.
As
a
natural
outgrowth
of_this
approach
it
was
often
suggested suggest%2:32:00::
that
the
doctor
should
complete complete%2:30:02::
the
preparation
for
painless
intercourse
by
dilating dilate%2:30:01::
the
vagina
.
This
recommendation
was
based base%2:31:00::
on
the
fact
that
the
hymen
was be%2:42:06::
not
the
only
barrier
to
smooth
consummation
of
the
sex_act
.
The
vagina
is be%2:42:06::
an
organ
capable_of
remarkable
contraction
and
dilation
.
This
is be%2:42:03::
obvious
when
it
is be%2:42:03::
remembered
that
,
during
childbirth
,
the
vagina
must
dilate dilate%2:30:01::
enough
to
permit permit%2:41:00::
the
passage
of
the
baby
.
The
intricate
system
of
muscles
that
manage manage%2:41:00::
the
contraction
and
dilatation
of
the
vagina
are be%2:42:03::
partly
under
voluntary
control
.
But
an
instinctive
reflex
may
work work%2:35:02::
against
the
conscious
intention
of
the
woman
.
That_is
,
when
first
penetration
takes_place take_place%2:30:00::
,
the
pressure
and
pain
signals
may
involuntarily
cause cause%2:32:00::
all
the
vaginal
muscles
to
contract contract%2:35:04::
in
an
effort
to
bar bar%2:35:00::
the
intrusion
and
prevent prevent%2:41:01::
further
pain
.
The
advantages
of
dilatation
by
the
physician
are be%2:42:03::
both
physical
and
psychological
.
Since
it
is be%2:42:03::
a
purely
professional
situation
,
none
of
the
pain
is
associated associate%2:31:00::
with
love-making
or
the
beloved
.
By
using use%2:34:01::
instruments
of
gradually
increasing
size
,
the
vagina
is
gently
,
and
with
minimum
pain
at
each
stage
,
taught teach%2:30:00::
to
yield yield%2:30:00::
to
an
object
of
the
appropriate
shape
.
In_this
process
the
vaginal
muscles
come come%2:30:03::
under
better
conscious
control
by
the
girl
.
She
learns learn%2:31:00::
how
to
relax relax%2:30:01::
them
to
accept accept%2:40:03::
-
instead
of
contracting contract%2:35:04::
them
to
repel repel%2:35:00::
the
entering
object
.
Apart
from
the
standard
problem
of
controlling control%2:41:01::
the
vaginal
muscles
,
other
serious
barriers
may
exist exist%2:42:00::
that
need need%2:42:00::
special
gynecological
treatment
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
far
better
to
have have%2:30:00::
such
conditions
treated treat%2:29:00::
in_advance
than
to
have have%2:30:00::
them
show_up show_up%2:30:00::
on
the
honeymoon
where
they
can
create create%2:36:00::
a
really
serious
situation
.
When
no
medical
problems
exist exist%2:42:00::
,
the
newly
married_couple
generally
prefer prefer%2:37:00::
to
cope_with cope_with%2:41:00::
the
adjustments
of
their
new
relationship
by
themselves
.
Special
information
and
guidance
about
the
possible
difficulties
are be%2:42:03::
still
of
great
value
.
Folk-lore
,
superstition
and
remembered
passages
from
erotic
literature
can
create create%2:36:00::
physical
and
emotional
problems
if
blindly
taken take%2:31:07::
as
scientific
facts
and
useful
hints
.
The
importance
of
loving
tenderness
is be%2:42:03::
obvious
.
The
long
,
unhurried
approach
and
the
deliberate
prolongation
of
fore-play
work work%2:41:03::
on
several
levels
.
Under
the
excitement
of
caresses
and
sexual
stimulation
the
vagina
relaxes relax%2:30:02::
and
dilates dilate%2:30:01::
and
the
local
moisture
greatly
increases increase%2:30:00::
,
providing provide%2:40:00::
an
excellent
lubricant
to
help help%2:41:00::
achieve achieve%2:41:00::
an
easier
penetration
.
Extensive
observations
by
physicians
during
vaginal
examinations
have
established establish%2:31:00::
the
fact
that
a
single
finger
inserted insert%2:35:00::
along
the
anterior
wall
(
the
top
line
of
the
vagina
as
the
woman
lies lie%2:35:00::
on
her
back
)
may
cause cause%2:36:00::
a
great_deal
of
distress
in
a
virgin
.
But
during
the
same
examination
,
two
fingers
may
be
inserted insert%2:35:00::
along
the
posterior
wall
(
the
bottom
of
the
vagina
in
the
same
position
)
without
any
pain
;
and
in_fact
without
any
difficulty
if
the
pressure
is
kept keep%2:42:00::
downward
at_all_times
.
These
regional
differences
of
sensitivity
to
pain
may
be be%2:42:03::
of
crucial
significance
during
the
earliest
intercourse
.
The
husband
and
wife
should
start start%2:30:00::
with
this
anatomical
information
clearly
in
mind
.
They
may
then
adjust adjust%2:30:02::
their
positions
and
movements
to
avoid avoid%2:41:01::
too_much
pressure
on
the
urethra
and
the
anterior
wall
of
the
vagina
;
at_least
until
repeated
intercourse
has
dilated dilate%2:30:01::
it
and
pain
is be%2:42:06::
no_longer
a
possible
threat
against
the
full
pleasure
of
love-making
.
In_fact
,
the
technical
procedure
in
medical_examinations
may
be
wisely
adapted adapt%2:30:01::
to
his
romantic
purposes
by
the
husband
during
the
honeymoon
.
Locker-room
talk
often
stresses stress%2:32:00::
the
idea
that
a
man
is
doing do%2:41:01::
the
girl
a
favor
if
he
is be%2:42:03::
forceful
and
ruthless
during
the
first
penetration
.
The
false
reasoning
is be%2:42:06::
that
a
gradual
advance
prolongs prolong%2:30:00::
the
pain
while
a
swift
powerful
act
gets get%2:30:02::
it
over
with
and
leaves leave%2:42:02::
the
girl
pleased
with
his
virility
and
grateful
for
his
decisiveness
in
settling settle%2:31:00::
the
problem
once_and_for_all
.
Such
talk
is be%2:42:03::
seriously
in
error
.
Ruthlessness
at
this
time
can
be be%2:42:03::
a
very
severe
shock
to
the
bride
,
both
physically
and
psychologically
.
The
insistent
,
forceful
penetration
may
tear tear%2:35:00::
and
inflame inflame%2:29:01::
the
vaginal
walls
as_well
as
do do%2:36:02::
excessive
damage
to
the
hymen
.
The
pain
and
distress
associated associate%2:31:00::
with
the
performance
may
easily
give give%2:40:03::
the
wife
a
deep-seated
dread
of
marital
relations
and
cause cause%2:32:00::
her
,
unconsciously
,
to
make make%2:30:00::
the
sex_act
unpleasant
and
difficult
for
both
by
exercising exercise%2:34:00::
her
vaginal
muscles
to
complicate complicate%2:30:00::
his
penetration
instead
of
relaxing relax%2:30:01::
them
to
facilitate facilitate%2:30:00::
it
.
Serious
attention
must
also
be
given give%2:31:02::
to
the
husband
's
problems
in
the
honeymoon
situation
.
The
necessity
for
keeping keep%2:42:00::
alert
to
his
bride
's
hazards
can
act_as act_as%2:42:00::
an
interference
with
the
man
's
spontaneous
desire
.
The
emotional
stimulation
may
be be%2:42:03::
so
great
that
he
may
experience experience%2:39:00::
a
premature
climax
.
This
is be%2:42:03::
a
very
common
experience
and
should
in_no_way
discourage discourage%2:37:00::
or
dishearten dishearten%2:37:00::
either
husband
or
wife
.
Or
the
frequent
need
to
check check%2:41:08::
and
discipline discipline%2:41:01::
himself
to
the
wisest
pace
of
the
consummation
can
put put%2:35:05::
him
off
stride
and
make make%2:41:00::
it
impossible
for
him
to
be be%2:42:03::
continuously
ready
for
penetration
over
a
long
period
.
The
signals
to
proceed proceed%2:41:00::
may
therefore
come come%2:38:04::
when
he
is be%2:42:03::
momentarily
not
able
to
take_advantage take_advantage%2:40:00::
IN
them
.
The
best
course
is be%2:42:06::
to
recover recover%2:40:00::
his
physical
excitement
by
a
change
of
pace
that
makes make%2:30:00::
him
ardent
again
.
This
may
require require%2:42:00::
imagination
and
reminding remind%2:31:00::
himself
that
now
he
can
be be%2:42:03::
demanding
and
self-centered
.
He
can
take take%2:39:00::
security
from
the
fact
that
the
progress
he
has
made make%2:36:08::
by
his
gentle
approach
will
not
be
lost lose%2:40:02::
.
Now
while
he
uses use%2:34:01::
talk
,
caresses
or
requires require%2:34:00::
caresses
from
her
,
his
bride
will
sympathetically
understand understand%2:31:01::
the
situation
and
eagerly
help help%2:41:00::
him
restore restore%2:41:01::
his
physical
situation
so
they
can
have have%2:39:06::
the
consummation
they
both
so
eagerly
desire desire%2:37:00::
.
A
final
word
.
The
accumulated
information
on
this
point
shows show%2:32:00::
that
first
intercourse
,
even
when
it
is
achieved achieve%2:41:00::
with
minimum
pain
or
difficulty
,
is be%2:42:03::
seldom
an
overwhelming
sexual
experience
to
a
woman
.
Too
many
new
things
are
happening happen%2:30:00::
for
it
to
be be%2:42:03::
a
complete
erotic
fulfillment
.
Only
under
rare
circumstances
would
a
bride
experience experience%2:39:00::
an
orgasm
during
her
first
intercourse
.
Both
man_and_wife
should
be be%2:42:03::
aware_of
the
fact
that
a
lack
of
climax
,
and
even
the
absence
of
the
anticipated
keen
pleasure
are be%2:42:06::
not
a
sign
that
the
wife
may
be be%2:42:03::
cold
or
frigid
.
If
the
early
approaches
are be%2:42:03::
wise
,
understanding
and
patient
,
the
satisfactions
of
marital
fulfillment
will
probably
be
discovered discover%2:31:01::
before
the
marriage
is be%2:42:03::
much
older
.
Writing write%2:36:00::
in

volume
on
the
nude

Perhaps
