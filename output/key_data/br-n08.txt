If
she
sensed sense%2:39:00::
any
unusual
preoccupation
on
the
part
of
her
mother
,
she
did
not
comment comment%2:32:00::
upon
it
.
After
they
had
finished finish%2:30:02::
eating eat%2:34:00::
,
Melissa
took take%2:35:00::
Sprite
the
kitten
under
her
arm
-
``
so_that
Auntie_Grace
can
teach teach%2:32:00::
it
about
the
whistle
''
-
and
climbed climb%2:38:00::
into
the
station_wagon
beside
her
mother
.
She
had
offered offer%2:41:00::
to
walk walk%2:38:00::
,
but
Pamela
knew know%2:31:02::
she
would
not
feel feel%2:37:00::
comfortable
about
her
child
until
she
had
personally
confided confide%2:40:00::
her
to
the
care
of
the
little
pink
woman
who
chose choose%2:31:02::
to
be be%2:42:03::
called
``
Auntie
''
.
When
they
reached reach%2:38:01::
their
neighbor
's
house
,
Pamela
said say%2:32:00::
a_few
polite
words
to
Grace
and
kissed kiss%2:35:00::
Melissa
lightly
on
the
forehead
,
the
impulse
prompted prompt%2:36:00::
by
a
stray
thought
-
of
the
type
to_which
she
was be%2:42:03::
frequently
subject
these
days
-
that
they
might
never
see see%2:39:00::
one
another
again
.
Then
she
turned turn%2:38:00::
the
station_wagon
around
and
headed head%2:38:00::
it
back
down
the
hill
,
with
the
village
as
her
ostensible
destination
.
As
she
drove drive%2:38:01::
,
she
thought_about think_about%2:31:05::
her
plan
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
really
quite
simple
.
So
simple
,
in_fact
,
that
it
might
even
work work%2:41:03::
-
although
Pamela
,
now
,
in
her
new
frame_of_mind
,
was be%2:42:03::
careful
not
to
pretend pretend%2:32:00::
too_much
assurance
.
That
mistake
,
she
thought think%2:31:01::
,
had
cost cost%2:42:01::
her
dearly
these
past
few
days
,
and
she
wanted want%2:37:00::
to
avoid avoid%2:41:01::
falling fall%2:30:08::
into
any_more
of
the
traps
that
the
mountain
might
set set%2:30:09::
for
her
.
She
must
be be%2:42:03::
cautious
so
as
not
to
alert alert%2:32:00::
the
scheming
forest
.
When
the
station_wagon
drew draw%2:38:02::
abreast_of
the
dusty
dirt
road
that
led lead%2:42:00::
up
to
the
porch
of
the
Culver
house
,
Pamela
turned turn%2:38:00::
the
wheel
,
guiding guide%2:38:01::
the
car
to
its
familiar
parking
spot
close_to
the
house
,
and
stopped stop%2:38:00::
.
All_of
her
movements
were be%2:42:03::
careful
and
methodical
,
partaking partake%2:42:00::
of
the
stealth
of
a
criminal
who
has
plotted plot%2:31:00::
his
felony
for
months
in_advance
and
knows know%2:31:01::
exactly
which
step
to
take take%2:31:01::
next
in
the
course
of
the
final
execution
of
his
crime
.
She
locked lock%2:35:00::
the
ignition
,
removed remove%2:30:00::
the
keys
,
stepped step%2:38:00::
out
of
the
car
and
went_into go_into%2:38:00::
the
house
.
Here
,
she
dropped drop%2:38:01::
the
keys
on
a
small
table
beside
the
door
and
went go%2:38:00::
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
.
On
her
bureau
lay lie%2:42:00::
a
small
,
brass
ornament
of
simple
design
and
faded
engraving
-
an
object
which
,
Pamela
believed believe%2:31:00::
now
,
had
been be%2:42:06::
the
property
of
her
great-grandfather
,
Major_Hiram_Munroe_Culver
.
He
had
belonged_to belong_to%2:42:00::
this
land
and
,
perhaps
,
had
desecrated desecrate%2:41:00::
it
-
and
this
was be%2:42:06::
the
only
material
symbol
that
remained remain%2:42:01::
of
him
.
If
she
,
Pamela
,
were
being
held hold%2:31:01::
responsible_for
his
crimes
,
then
hers
must
be be%2:42:06::
the
final
act
of
expiation
.
She
would
return return%2:40:08::
this
symbol
to
the
mountain
,
as
one
pours pour%2:38:03::
seed
back
into
the
soil
every
Spring
&
&
&
or
as
ancient
fertility
cults
demand demand%2:42:00::
annual
human
sacrifice
.
Slowly
and
thoughtfully
,
she
slipped slip%2:30:04::
the
ornament
into
the
pocket
of
her
slacks
,
moved move%2:38:03::
down_the_stairs
and
out
of
the
house
.
There
was
only
one
place
where
the
mountain
might
receive receive%2:35:00::
her
-
that
unnamed
,
unnameable
pool
harbored harbor%2:39:00::
in
its
secret
bosom
.
Atonement
,
if
atonement
were be%2:42:03::
possible
,
could
only
be
made make%2:41:00::
at
that
sacred
,
sacrificial
basin
.
It
was be%2:42:06::
there
that
she
would
have_to
enact enact%2:36:00::
her
renunciation
,
beg beg%2:32:00::
forgiveness
.
Perhaps
it
was be%2:42:03::
insane
,
Pamela
thought think%2:31:03::
.
Perhaps
it
was be%2:42:03::
all
a
vividly
conceived conceive%2:36:00::
dream
.
But
she
was
caught catch%2:35:06::
in
it
,
and
she
faced face%2:33:00::
the
terrible
possibility
that
,
if
it
were be%2:42:06::
a
dream
,
it
was be%2:42:06::
one
from
which
she
might
never
awaken awaken%2:29:01::
.
Facing face%2:42:00::
the
forest
now
,
she
who
had
not
dared dare%2:41:01::
to
enter enter%2:38:00::
it
before
,
walked walk%2:38:00::
between
two
trees
at_random
and
headed head%2:38:00::
in_what
she
believed believe%2:31:00::
was be%2:42:06::
the
direction
of
the
pool
.
She
remembered remember%2:31:00::
little
of
her
previous
journey
there
with
Grace
,
and
she
could
but
hope hope%2:37:01::
that
her
dedication
to
her
mission
would
enable enable%2:30:00::
her
to
accomplish accomplish%2:36:00::
it
.
The
forest
was be%2:42:03::
open
and
freely
welcoming
,
extending extend%2:29:01::
an
enchanted
hand
.
The
ground
was be%2:42:03::
covered
with
soft
pine
needles
and
the
slope
was be%2:42:03::
gentle
.
Birds
chirped chirp%2:32:00::
and
chattered chatter%2:32:00::
in
the
trees
and
the
sun
,
all
dewy-eyed
and
soft
,
caressed caress%2:35:00::
her
shoulders
warmly
from_time_to_time
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
not
,
thought think%2:31:01::
Pamela
,
such
an
evil
place
after_all
.
No
wonder
Melissa
responded respond%2:31:01::
so
completely
to
its
beckoning
.
Perhaps
she
had have%2:40:00::
no
reason
to
fear fear%2:37:00::
these
trees
that
whispered whisper%2:32:00::
their
secrets
above
her
head
as
she
passed pass%2:38:00::
.
Was
it
not
possible
,
after_all
,
that
the
forest
was be%2:42:03::
in
league
with
her
and
her
child
,
that
its
sympathy
lay lie%2:42:01::
with
the
Culvers
,
that
she
had
erred err%2:31:00::
in
failing fail%2:41:02::
to
understand understand%2:31:01::
this
?
Pamela
felt feel%2:37:00::
calm
and
peaceful
as
she
walked walk%2:38:00::
along
.
The
slight
flutter
that
had
disturbed disturb%2:35:01::
the
motion
of
her
heart
when
she
entered enter%2:38:00::
the
forest
was be%2:42:03::
gone
now
,
and
even
the
dim
groves
of
trees
through
which
she
occasionally
passed pass%2:38:00::
did
not
reawaken reawaken%2:29:00::
her
fear
.
She
regarded regard%2:31:00::
them
as
signs
that
she
was
nearing near%2:38:00::
the
glen
she
sought seek%2:35:00::
,
and
she
was be%2:42:03::
glad
to
at_last
be
doing do%2:41:01::
something
positive
in
her
unenunciated
,
undefined
struggle
with
the
mountain
and
its
darkling
inhabitants
.
Having
persisted persist%2:42:01::
too
long
in
deliberate
ignorance
and
denial
of
the
forces
that
threatened threaten%2:42:00::
her
,
Pamela
was be%2:42:03::
relieved
now
to
admit admit%2:32:00::
their
potency
and
to
be
taking take%2:40:04::
definite
steps
toward
grappling grapple%2:41:00::
with
them
.
A_few
days
ago
,
she
would
have
thought think%2:31:01::
such
an
expedition
as
this
utterly
ridiculous
;
today
,
on_the_contrary
,
it
seemed seem%2:39:00::
utterly
reasonable
.
She
did
not
pause pause%2:42:00::
to
consider consider%2:39:00::
what
she
would
do do%2:41:01::
if
her
plan
should
fail fail%2:41:00::
;
she
directed direct%2:38:01::
all_of
her
mental
and
physical
energy
toward
achieving achieve%2:41:00::
this
one
goal
.
If
,
as
she
walked walk%2:38:00::
,
her
steps
fumbled fumble%2:38:00::
from_time_to_time
,
she
chose choose%2:31:02::
to
ignore ignore%2:32:02::
that
omen
.
If
the
slope
grew grow%2:30:03::
steeper
and
the
groves
more
dim
,
she
tried try%2:41:00::
not
to
heed heed%2:41:00::
.
Success
depended_upon depend_upon%2:42:00::
maintaining maintain%2:42:00::
her
equanimity
;
she
must
be be%2:42:03::
poised
and
proud
and
unafraid
in_order_to
prove prove%2:31:00::
to
the
mountain
that
she
was be%2:42:03::
in_earnest
.
The
forest
took_on take_on%2:30:00::
an
impersonal
aspect
.
It
did
not
care care%2:37:02::
what
sort_of
person
prowled prowl%2:42:00::
its
woods
,
plucked pluck%2:35:00::
at
its
bark
or
stripped strip%2:30:06::
the
berries
from
its
bushes
.
Unconcerned
,
indifferent
,
unmotivated
,
the
forest
was be%2:42:03::
simply
there
-
fighting fight%2:33:01::
man
's
depredations
with
more
abundant
growth
and
man
's
follies
with
its
own
musical
evening
laughter
.
Red_man
or
white_man
,
pacifist
or
killer
,
the
forest
would
accept accept%2:40:00::
them
all
-
knowing know%2:31:01::
that
it
could
thrive thrive%2:30:00::
equally
well
on
slaughter
and
beneficence
;
knowing know%2:31:01::
that
its
ageless
mass
would
always
dwarf dwarf%2:42:00::
the
short
span
of
time
allotted allot%2:40:01::
to
any
man
.
Pamela
shook shake%2:38:00::
her
head
.
She
must_not must_not%2:42:00::
think_about think_about%2:31:03::
time
.
That
was be%2:42:06::
another
one
of
those
traps
.
In
her
grim
pursuit
of
tranquillity
,
Pamela
focused focus%2:31:00::
her
thoughts
on
her
husband
.
If
,
when
this
was be%2:42:03::
all_over
,
she
found find%2:40:02::
the
words
to
tell tell%2:32:01::
him
about
it
,
she
wondered wonder%2:32:01::
if
he
would
ever
understand understand%2:31:01::
.
How
could
he
comprehend comprehend%2:31:00::
her
need
when
he
himself
was be%2:42:03::
innocent
?
Indian
ghosts
would
not
impinge impinge%2:41:10::
upon
his
nights
,
nor
would
his
days
be
haunted haunt%2:37:00::
by
the
dimly-outlined
,
ill-conceived
figure
of
her
benighted
ancestor
.
His
bright
,
daylight
mind
would
whistle whistle%2:38:01::
away
such
images
;
they
would
not
dare dare%2:41:01::
to
face face%2:33:00::
his
scoffing
.
Pamela
was be%2:42:03::
glad
Jim
was be%2:42:05::
nowhere
near
.
His
presence
would
have
interfered interfere%2:41:01::
with
her
duty
.
The
mountainside
grew grow%2:30:03::
steeper
and
she
slipped slip%2:38:00::
once
or
twice
on
the
smooth
pine
needles
.
The
trees
huddled huddle%2:38:01::
more
closely
together
,
their
limbs
and
leaves
intertwined
in
a
coarse
curtain
against
the
sun
.
Bushes
and
vines
abetted abet%2:41:00::
the
rocks
in
forming form%2:42:02::
thorny
detours
for
the
struggling
stranger
,
and
without
the
direct
light
of
the
sun
to
act_as act_as%2:42:00::
compass
,
Pamela
could
no_longer
be be%2:42:03::
positive
of
her
direction
.
Nevertheless
,
she
continued continue%2:42:01::
to
move move%2:38:03::
upward
.
She
was be%2:42:03::
sure
she
would
reach reach%2:38:01::
the
pool
by
climbing climb%2:38:00::
,
and
she
clung cling%2:37:00::
to
that
belief
despite
the
increasing
number
of
obstacles
.
The
forest
had
become become%2:42:01::
an
alien
world
where
she
strove strive%2:33:00::
,
alone
,
unprotected
,
unguided
,
to
deal deal%2:41:13::
with
whatever
hindrances
were
offered offer%2:40:02::
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
a
bold
,
dark
castle
of
pine
boughs
that
stood stand%2:35:00::
like
a
medieval
fortress
,
eclipsing eclipse%2:39:00::
the
sun
and
human
time
.
At
one_and_the_same
time
,
she
was be%2:42:05::
within
it
but
still
searching search%2:35:00::
for
the
drawbridge
that
would
give give%2:40:02::
her
entry
.
Silence
came come%2:38:00::
into
the
forest
-
a
solid
being
that
clapped clap%2:35:03::
its
hand
over
the
murmuring murmur%2:32:00::
mouths
of
the_birds
and
the
whispered
comfort
of
the
trees
.
Silence
walked walk%2:38:00::
at
Pamela
's
side
,
its
presence
numbingly
close
,
yet
too
far
for
her
to
hear hear%2:39:00::
.
Silence
stood stand%2:35:00::
in
front
of
her
,
waiting wait%2:31:00::
,
and
in
back
of
her
,
blocking block%2:35:00::
her
retreat
.
She
stumbled stumble%2:38:00::
over
the
root
of
a
tree
that
protruded protrude%2:42:00::
maliciously
above
the
earth
.
In_spite_of
her
attempt
to
preserve preserve%2:40:01::
her
balance
,
she
fell fall%2:38:03::
,
bruising bruise%2:35:00::
her
arm
on
a
naked
stone
.
For
a
moment
,
she
could
not
catch catch%2:40:00::
her
breath
and_then
,
her
breath
returning return%2:30:01::
in_short
,
frightened
spasms
,
she
lifted lift%2:38:00::
herself
to
her
feet
laboriously
.
She
started start%2:30:00::
to
brush brush%2:35:01::
the
dirt
and
bits
of
leaves
off
her
clothes
.
Her
arm
bled bleed%2:29:00::
slightly
,
and
the
offended
skin
cried_out cry_out%2:32:00::
in
pain
.
She
looked_around look_around%2:39:00::
.
She
was be%2:42:03::
bewildered
.
She
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
have
come come%2:38:03::
such
a
long
distance
-
too
far
for
her
destination
which
had
wilfully
been
swallowed_up swallow_up%2:35:00::
in
the
greedy
gloom
of
the
trees
.
She
stood stand%2:35:00::
quite
still
,
trying try%2:41:00::
to
focus focus%2:31:00::
upon
a
direction
in_which
to
turn turn%2:38:00::
,
a
path
to
follow follow%2:38:01::
,
a
clue
to
guide guide%2:41:00::
her
.
She
was
standing stand%2:42:03::
in
a
thick
grove
.
The
trees
were be%2:42:03::
crowded
so
closely
together
that
their
branches
overlapped overlap%2:42:01::
,
virtually
shutting_out shut_out%2:41:00::
the
sun
completely
.
The
earth
smelled smell%2:39:00::
moist
and
pungent
as
it
might
in
a
cave
deprived_of
the
cleansing
effect
of
the
sun
's
rays
.
She
had have%2:39:06::
the
feeling
that
,
under
the
mouldering
leaves
,
there
would
be be%2:42:05::
the
bodies
of
dead_animals
,
quietly
decaying decay%2:30:01::
and
giving give%2:40:00::
their
soil
back
to
the
mountain
.
The
thought
made make%2:30:00::
Pamela
shudder shudder%2:29:00::
.
A
terrible
chill
swept sweep%2:38:00::
through
the
grove
.
Not
a
breeze
exactly
,
but
a
pocket
of
icy
air
that
settled settle%2:38:01::
with
a
loathsome
familiarity
upon
the
deep
confines
of
the
grove
,
catching catch%2:31:01::
Pamela
in
a
leering
embrace
.
There
was
a
peculiar
density
about
it
,
a
thick
substance
that

It

every

Her

Twigs
