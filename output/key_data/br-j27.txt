With
this
evidence
in
mind
,
the
writer
began begin%2:30:00::
to
plan plan%2:31:00::
how
he
might
more
effectively
educate educate%2:31:00::
the
married
students
in
his
functional
classes
.
Toward
the
end
of
the
semester
's
work
,
he
interviewed interview%2:32:01::
every
married
class
member
at_great_length
.
He
found find%2:39:01::
,
as
he
had
suspected suspect%2:31:02::
,
a
general
consensus
that
perhaps
over
half
of
the
present
functionally
designed
course
was be%2:42:03::
not
really
functional
for
these
students
.
However
,
all
admitted admit%2:32:00::
that
the
``
hind
sight
''
was be%2:42:03::
not
altogether
lost
.
In
their
own
words
,
it
had
aided aid%2:41:00::
them
to
get get%2:40:00::
a
clearer
picture
of
how
they
had
gotten_into get_into%2:42:00::
their
marriages
,
and
perhaps
they
had
obtained obtain%2:40:00::
some
insights
on
why
certain
troubles
appeared appear%2:30:02::
from_time_to_time
.
In_fact
,
they
went go%2:30:01::
so_far
as
to
caution caution%2:32:00::
the
writer
that
if
he
attempted attempt%2:41:00::
to
design design%2:31:00::
a
section
exclusively
for
married
students
there
should
be be%2:42:04::
,
at
the
beginning
,
some
``
hind
sight
''
study
;
but
they
all
hastened hasten%2:30:00::
to
add add%2:32:01::
that
certainly
less
time
was
needed need%2:42:00::
on_it
than
presently
spent spend%2:42:00::
.
All_of
them
felt feel%2:31:00::
a
compelling
need
for
more
coverage
on
areas
that
could
be
only
lightly
touched_upon touch_on%2:32:01::
in
a
general
survey
functional
course
.
A_few
were be%2:42:03::
doubtful
about
the
merits
of
an
exclusive
section
for
married
students
.
As
one
of
them
expressed express%2:32:00::
it
,
``
It
has
done do_good%2:40:00::
me
a
world
of
good
to
listen listen%2:39:01::
to
the
nai
^
ve
questions
and
comments
of
these
not-yet-married
people
.
I
can
now
better
see see%2:31:01::
just
what
processes
provoked provoke%2:36:00::
certain
actions
from
me
in_the_past
.
Had
I
been be%2:42:05::
in
an
all-married
section
I
would
have
missed miss%2:39:00::
this
,
and
I
believe believe%2:31:03::
that
this
single
aspect
has
been be%2:42:03::
of
great
personal
value
to
me
''
.
This
comment
and_others
similar
to_it
,
would
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
indicate indicate%2:32:02::
a
possible
justification
for
continuing continue%2:42:00::
the
status_quo
.
But
the
weight
of
feeling
was be%2:42:03::
heavily
in_the_opposite_direction
.
Thus
,
the
writer
decided decide%2:31:00::
to
hold hold%2:36:00::
one
experimental
section
of
the
functional
preparation
for
marriage
course
in
the
spring
semester
of
1960
exclusively
for
persons
already
married
-
that_is
,
prerequisite
:
``
marriage
''
.
This
did
not
mean mean%2:42:00::
that
married
students
could
not
enroll enroll%2:41:00::
in
other
``
mixed
''
sections
,
and
some
of
them
,
largely
because
of
scheduling
difficulties
,
did
.
But
only
those
already
married
could
enroll enroll%2:41:00::
in_this
one
section
.
In_addition
,
two
other
differences
in
the
two
types
of
sections
must
be
noted note%2:39:02::
.
1
)
The
regular
sections
do
not
allow allow%2:41:00::
freshmen
;
this
one
did
.
This
action
was
rationalized rationalize%2:32:00::
on
the
basis
of
a
small
survey
which
indicated indicate%2:32:00::
that
a
high
percentage
of
married
freshmen
women
on
our
campus
never
become become%2:42:01::
sophomores
.
Many_of
them
appear appear%2:39:00::
to
drop_out drop_out%2:33:00::
,
for
one
reason
or
another
.
By
permitting permit%2:32:00::
freshman
students
we
might
extend extend%2:40:05::
the
opportunity
for
such
a
course
to
some
individuals
who
otherwise
might
never
get get%2:40:00::
to
take take%2:31:02::
it
.
This
has
subsequently
been
verified verify%2:31:01::
by
the
experience
.
2
)
Auditors
were
encouraged encourage%2:41:00::
.
In
the
regular
sections
they
have
always
been
more_or_less
discouraged discourage%2:32:01::
.
The
philosophy
has
been be%2:42:06::
that
if
they
could
find find%2:40:03::
the
time
to
attend attend%2:42:00::
class
why
not
encourage encourage%2:41:00::
them
to
get get%2:40:00::
the
credit
and
perhaps
provide provide%2:34:00::
an
incentive
to
do do%2:41:01::
the
work
more
effectively
.
Besides
,
auditors
do
not
count count%2:42:00::
on
faculty
load
with
the
same
weight
as
regularly
enrolled
students
.
But
in_this
one
section
we
welcomed welcome%2:35:00::
auditors
.
Why
?
For
no
particular
reason
,
other_than
that
the
writer
felt feel%2:31:00::
it
might
-
just
might
-
encourage encourage%2:41:00::
both
mates
to
be be%2:42:03::
in_attendance
.
Many_of
the
men
on
our
campus
have have%2:42:00::
a
pretty
set
curriculum
,
especially
in
the
various
engineering
fields
,
with
few
electives
till
the
senior
year
.
Incidentally
,
it
needs need%2:42:02::
to
be
noted note%2:39:00::
that
because
auditors
were
permitted permit%2:32:00::
the
section
began begin%2:30:00::
increasing increase%2:30:00::
in
numbers
each_week
,
until
at_last
it
swelled swell%2:30:00::
to
such
proportions
that
this
``
free
''
auditing
policy
had have%2:42:05::
to
be
retracted retract%2:32:00::
.
After_that
,
we
began begin%2:30:00::
to
get get%2:30:03::
``
visitors
''
to
class
.
This
experimental
class
represented represent%2:41:02::
quite
a
variety
of
students
.
It
ranged range%2:42:01::
from
a
freshman
woman
,
just
married marry%2:41:00::
,
through
the
various
academic
growth
stages
,
including include%2:42:00::
one
senior-graduate
student
,
to
a
young
faculty_member
recently
married marry%2:41:00::
to
a
senior
man
who
also
attended attend%2:42:00::
.
It
ranged range%2:42:01::
from
those
with
no
children
,
through
students
in
various
stages
of
pregnancy
,
to
one
44
-
year-old
male
with
four
children
,
three
of
whom
were be%2:42:06::
teenagers
.
It
ranged range%2:42:01::
from
two
women
members
who
had
experienced experience%2:31:00::
premarital
pregnancy
to
one
couple
twelve
years
married
and
seemingly
unable
to
conceive conceive%2:29:00::
.
One
might
digress digress%2:32:00::
at
this
point
and
speculate speculate%2:32:00::
that
if
it
is be%2:42:03::
``
wise
''
to
create create%2:36:02::
special
sections
for
special
status
,
then
why
not
a
special
section
for
women
pregnant
before
marriage
,
and
one
for
44
-
year-old
men
with
teenage
children
,
and_so_on
.
Some
of
these
speculations
may
have have%2:42:00::
some
merit
,
others
are be%2:42:03::
somewhat
ambiguous
.
But
few
who
have
experienced experience%2:31:00::
marriage
can
dispute dispute%2:32:00::
the
fact
that
the
focus
of
interpersonal
relationships
is be%2:42:03::
different
in
marriage
than
in
a
pre-marital
situation
.
The
writer
began begin%2:30:00::
this
special
class
by
explaining explain%2:32:00::
his
background
thinking
for
creating create%2:36:02::
such
a
section
in_the_first_place
.
He
made make%2:30:00::
it
clear
from_the_beginning
that
this
was be%2:42:06::
the
students
'
opportunity
,
and
that
the
future
destiny
of
such
groups
depended_on depend_on%2:42:00::
favorable
results
from
this
one
.
He
did
build build%2:36:00::
a
framework
of
academic
``
respectability
''
,
and
one
which
did
not
encroach_upon encroach_upon%2:38:00::
the
``
sacred
sovereignty
''
of
any
other
existing
campus
course
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
to
say say%2:32:00::
that
this
was be%2:42:06::
not
a
course
in
wise
buying
or
money
spending
methods
,
nor
a
course
in
how
to
raise raise%2:41:00::
children
.
We
already
have have%2:40:00::
courses
covering cover%2:32:01::
those
problems
,
and_so_on
.
But
within
that
framework
he
allowed_for allow_for%2:42:00::
as
much
flexibility
as
possible
.
A
steering_committee
of
students
was
organized organize%2:41:01::
on
the
first
day
whose
duty
it
was be%2:42:06::
to
be be%2:42:03::
alert
and
constantly
evaluate evaluate%2:31:00::
and
re-evaluate reevaluate%2:31:00::
the
direction
and
pace
the
class
was
taking take%2:30:01::
.
The
writer
,
being be%2:42:03::
cognizant
through
his
interviews
of
the
reactions
of
previous
married
students
,
did
insist insist%2:32:00::
on
there
being
included include%2:42:00::
some
``
hind
sight
''
material
.
But
the
greater
part
of
semester
time
was
actually
centered center%2:42:00::
around
the
attitudes
``
So
we
are be%2:42:03::
married
-
now
how
do
we
make make%2:30:00::
the
best
of_it
''
?
or
``
How
do
we
enrich enrich%2:30:00::
our
already
fine
marriage
''
?
Films
were
used use%2:34:02::
,
as
with
all
sections
,
but
with
one
big
difference
.
Our
campus
,
unfortunately
,
owns own%2:40:00::
no
films
.
Since
they
are
all
either
rented rent%2:40:00::
or
borrowed borrow%2:40:00::
,
the
requested
dates
for
their
use
have have%2:42:05::
to
be be%2:42:03::
far
in_advance
.
The
writer
never
knew know%2:31:01::
from
week
to
week
just
where
the
section
might
be be%2:42:03::
.
For_example
,
the
steering_committee
might
announce announce%2:32:00::
that
the
group
felt feel%2:31:00::
a
topic
under
study
should
not
be
dropped drop%2:30:01::
for
an
additional
week
as
there
was be%2:42:03::
still
too_much
of_it
untouched
.
Since
the
writer
had
established establish%2:31:02::
this
democratic
procedure
in_the_beginning
he
had have%2:42:05::
to
go_along go_along%2:41:00::
with
their
decision
-
after
,
of_course
,
pointing_out point_out%2:32:01::
whether
he
thought think%2:31:01::
their
decision
was be%2:42:06::
a
wise
or
an
unwise
one
.
Thus
the
films
seen see%2:39:03::
as
they
came_in come_in%2:38:01::
(
coordinated coordinate%2:30:00::
for
the
regular
sections
)
,
were be%2:42:03::
often
out
of
context
.
Nevertheless
,
the
writer
has
never
experienced experience%2:39:01::
such
spontaneity
of
discussion
after
film
showings
.
Though
it
did
not
become become%2:30:00::
known
to
the
writer
for_some_time
,
a
nucleus
group
had
sprung_up spring_up%2:42:00::
within
the
class
.
They
began begin%2:30:00::
to
meet meet%2:41:01::
in
the
evenings
and
carry_forward carry_forward%2:38:00::
various
discussions
they
felt feel%2:31:00::
not
fully
enough
covered cover%2:32:01::
in
class
.
From
a_few
students
this
group
gradually
increased increase%2:30:00::
to
include include%2:42:00::
over
three-fourths
of
those
officially
enrolled
in
the
class
,
and
many
outsiders
as_well
.
Also
,
although
only
a_few
of
the
students
were be%2:42:03::
intimately
acquainted_with
each
other
in_the_beginning
,
most
reported report%2:32:00::
that
when
the
semester
ended end%2:42:00::
their
dearest
and
closest
campus
friendships
were be%2:42:03::
with
members
of_that
class
.
In_fact
,
they
often
revamped revamp%2:30:00::
their
social_activities
to
include include%2:42:00::
class
members
previously
unknown
.
Supplemental
outside
reading
reports
were
handled handle%2:32:00::
just_as
in
the
other
sections
,
the
major
difference
being be%2:42:06::
that
there
was be%2:42:03::
a
noticeably
deeper
level
in
the
reported
outside
reading
by
the
married
group
.
These
students
,
although
they
might
read read%2:31:00::
various
articles
in
popular
magazines
,
more_often
chose choose%2:31:00::
to
report report%2:32:00::
on
articles
found find%2:40:02::
in
the
journals
.
In_addition
to
the
noticeable
difference
in
outside
articles
,
there
was be%2:42:03::
a
considerable
difference
in
the
outside
books
they
read read%2:31:00::
.
Whereas
a
high
per_cent
of
the
regular
students
can
be
expected expect%2:31:00::
to
read read%2:31:00::
other
texts
which
more_or_less
plow plow%2:32:00::
the
same
ground
in
a_little
different
direction
,
the
married
students
chose choose%2:31:00::
whole
books
on
specific
areas
and
went go%2:41:00::
into
much
greater
detail
in
their
areas
of
interest
.
Since
the
writer
had
not
noticed notice%2:39:04::
this
characteristic
in
married
students
scattered
throughout
the
various
sections
previous
to
this
experiment
,
nor
,
as_a_matter_of_fact
,
in
those
who
were
continuing continue%2:42:01::
in
``
single
sections
''
,
he
can
only
conclude conclude%2:31:00::
that
there
must
have
been be%2:42:04::
something
``
contagious
''
within
the
specific
group
which
caused cause%2:36:00::
this
to
occur occur%2:30:00::
.
In_the_main
,
this
course
took take%2:38:02::
the
following
directional
high
roads
:
1
)
A
great_deal
of
time
was
spent spend%2:42:00::
on
processes
for
solving solve%2:31:00::
marital
differences
.
This
was be%2:42:06::
not
a
search
for
a
``
magic
formula
''
,
but
rather
an
examination
of
basic_principles
pertaining pertain%2:42:01::
especially
to
all
types
of
communication
in
marriage
.
In_short
,
it
was
centered center%2:42:00::
around
learning learn%2:31:00::
how
to
develop develop%2:30:06::
a
more
sensitive
empathy
.
Not
until
the
group
was
satisfied satisfy%2:37:00::
in_this
area
were
they
willing
to
venture venture%2:41:01::
further
to
2
)
Specific
adjustment
areas
,
such_as
sex
,
in-laws
,
religion
,
finance
,
and_so_on
.
From
here
they
proceeded proceed%2:32:00::
to
3
)
These
same
areas
in_relation_to
their
own
future
family
life
stages
,
developing develop%2:30:06::
these
to
the
extent
of
examining examine%2:31:00::
various
crises
which
could
be
expected expect%2:31:00::
to
confront confront%2:32:03::
them
at_some_time
or
other
.
As
an
example
of_this
last
facet
,
there
were be%2:42:04::
some
lengthy
discussions
centered center%2:42:00::
around
bereavement
.
Mainly
these
were be%2:42:03::
concerned
with
the
possibility
of
the
death
of
one
parent
and
the
complication
of
living live%2:42:08::
with
the
survivor
afterward
,
but
the
possible
death
of
one
's
own
spouse
was
not
overlooked overlook%2:39:01::
.
Since
the
course
,
one
member
has
lost lose%2:37:00::
her
husband
.
This
was be%2:42:03::
not
a
particularly
shocking
or
unexpected
thing
-
it
was be%2:42:03::
previously
known
to
her
that
it
might
happen happen%2:30:00::
.
But
just
when
was be%2:42:06::
an
unknown
,
and
of_course
the
longer
it
did
not
happen happen%2:30:00::
,
the
stronger
her
wish
and
belief
that
it
might
not
.
Since
her
bereavement
this
individual
has
reported report%2:32:00::
to
the
writer
on
numerous
occasions
about
how
helpful
the
class
discussions
were be%2:42:03::
to
her
in_this
adjustment
crisis
.
Quite
frequently
class
members
brought bring%2:35:00::
questions
from
their
mates
at_home
.
These
were
often
carefully
written write%2:36:00::
out
with
a
great_deal
of
thought
behind
them
.
This
added add%2:40:00::
a
personal
zest
to
class
discussions
and
participation
.
Both
sexes
reported report%2:32:00::
that
the
discussions
on
sex
adjustment
within
marriage
were be%2:42:03::
extremely
enlightening
.
The
writer
sensed sense%2:39:00::
a
much
freer
and
more
frank
discussion
,
especially
of_this
one
area
,
than
ever
before
.
He
felt feel%2:31:00::
certain
for_the_first_time
in
his
teaching
experience
that
the
men
in
the
class
understood understand%2:31:00::
that
orgasm
,
as
a
criterion
,
is be%2:42:03::
not_nearly
so
essential
for
a
satisfying
female
sexual
experience
as
most
males
might
think think%2:31:01::
.
This
was be%2:42:03::
probably
much
more
meaningful
because
all
the
women
in
the
class
emphasized emphasize%2:32:00::
it
time_and_again
.
On_the_other_hand
,
the
women
class
members
appeared appear%2:39:00::
to
reach reach%2:38:00::
a
far
greater
understanding
than
have
women
members
in
other
sections
that
it
is be%2:42:03::
more
natural
for
males
as_a_group
to
view view%2:31:00::
sex
as
sex
rather_than
always
associating associate%2:31:00::
it
with_love
as
most
women
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
do
.
in
the
reproductive
area
it
could
be
readily
observed observe%2:39:02::
that
all
felt feel%2:37:00::
freer
to
discuss discuss%2:32:00::
things
than
students
had
previously
in
``
mixed
''
marital_status
sections
.
Perhaps
this
was
related relate%2:42:00::
to
the
fact
that
all
were be%2:42:03::
in
on_it
to_some_extent
.
Never
in
other
sections
has
there
been be%2:42:04::
the
opportunity
for
the
genuine
down-to-earth
discussions
about
the
feelings
of
both
spouses
during
various
stages
of
pregnancy
.
There
was be%2:42:04::
a
particularly
marvelous
opportunity
for
study
in_this
area
since
almost
every
stage
of
pregnancy
was
represented represent%2:32:00::
,
from
a
childless
couple
to
and
including include%2:42:00::
every
trimester
.
In_fact
,
we
had have%2:42:00::
one
birth
before
the
end
of
the
course
,
and
another
student
had_to
take take%2:39:00::
the
final
examiantion
a
week
early
,
just
to
be be%2:42:05::
on
the
safe
side
.
There
was be%2:42:04::
also
one
spontaneous
abortion
during
the
semester
.
