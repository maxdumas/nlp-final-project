entitled
``
East_Greenwich
Faces
a
Housing_Development
Problem
''
points point%2:32:00::
to
a
dilemma
that
faces face%2:32:03::
communities
such_as
ours
.
Your
suggested
solution
,
it
seems seem%2:39:01::
to
me
,
is be%2:42:03::
grossly
oversimplified
and
is be%2:42:03::
inconsistent
with
your
generally
realistic
attitude
toward
,
and
endorsement
of
,
sound
planning
.
First_of_all
there
is be%2:42:04::
ample
area
in
East_Greenwich
already
zoned
in
the
classification
similar
to_that
which
petitioner
requested request%2:32:01::
.
This
land
is be%2:42:03::
in
various
stages
of
development
in
several
locations
throughout
the
town
.
The
demand
for
these
lots
can
be
met meet%2:34:00::
for_some_time
to
come come%2:30:01::
.
This
would
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
indicate indicate%2:32:01::
that
we
are
trying try%2:41:00::
neither
``
to
halt halt%2:41:00::
an
influx
of
migrants
''
nor
are
we
``
setting_up set_up%2:41:02::
such
standards
for
development
that
only
the
well-to-do
could
afford afford%2:34:00::
to
buy buy%2:40:00::
land
and
build build%2:36:00::
in
the
new
sites
''
.
What
we
are
attempting attempt%2:41:00::
to
do do%2:36:01::
is be%2:42:03::
achieve achieve%2:41:00::
and
maintain maintain%2:40:00::
a
balance
between
medium
density
and
low_density
residential
areas
and
industrial
and
commercial
development
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
in_fact
entirely
consistent_with
your
suggestion
of
modest
industrial
development
to
help help%2:41:00::
pay pay%2:40:00::
governmental
costs
.
Bostitch
,
Inc.
is be%2:42:03::
approximately
half_way
through
a
10
-
year
exemption
of
their
real_estate
tax
.
The
wisdom
of
granting grant%2:40:05::
such
tax
exemptions
is be%2:42:03::
another
matter
,
but
this
particular
instance
is be%2:42:03::
,
in
my
opinion
,
completely
satisfactory
.
The
1960
tax
book
for
East_Greenwich
indicates indicate%2:32:04::
a
valuation
for
this
property
in_excess
of
two
million
dollars
.
With
our
current
$
3
per
hundred
tax_rate
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
safe
to
assume assume%2:31:00::
that
this
will
qualify qualify%2:42:00::
when
you
suggest suggest%2:32:00::
a
community
should
``
try try%2:41:00::
to
develop develop%2:36:01::
a
modest
industrial
plant
''
as
the
best
way
to
meet meet%2:41:02::
these
problems
.
In_order_to
attract attract%2:37:01::
additional
industry
that
is be%2:42:03::
compatible
with
this
community
it
is be%2:42:03::
all
the
more
important
to
present present%2:39:00::
to
the
industrial
prospect
an
orderly
balance
in
the
tax
structure
.
As
this
tax_base
grows grow%2:30:00::
so
then
can
your
medium
and
low_density
residential
areas
grow grow%2:30:00::
.
Mr._Richard_Preston
,
executive_director
of
the
New_Hampshire
State_Planning
and
Development_Commission
,
in
his
remarks
to
the
Governors_Conference
on
Industrial_Development
at
Providence
on
October
8
,
1960
,
warned warn%2:32:00::
against
the
fallacy
of
attempting attempt%2:41:00::
to
attract attract%2:37:01::
industry
solely
to
reduce reduce%2:30:00::
the
tax_rate
or
to
underwrite underwrite%2:32:01::
municipal
services
such_as
schools
when
he
said say%2:32:00::
:
``
If
this
is be%2:42:03::
the
fundamental
reason
for

the
basic
approach

if
any
will
be be%2:42:03::

.
He
went_on go_on%2:32:00::
to
say say%2:32:00::
:
``
In_the_first_place
,
industry
per_se

While
Councilman_Olson
cited cite%2:36:00::
the
anticipated
increase
in
school
costs
in
answer
to
a
direct
question
from
a
taxpayer

the
impact
upon
a

does
not

to
be
measured measure%2:30:00::
only
in
increased
taxes
to
find find%2:40:02::
alarm
in
uncontrolled
growth
.
We
in
East_Greenwich
have have%2:40:00::
the
example
of
two
neighboring
communities
,
one
currently
utilizing utilize%2:41:00::
double
sessions
in
their
schools
,
and
the
other
facing face%2:32:00::
this
prospect
next
year
.
It
has
already
been
reported report%2:32:00::
in
your
newspapers
that
the
East_Greenwich_School_Committee
is
considering consider%2:32:02::
additions
to
at_least
one
elementary_school
and
to
the
high_school
to
insure insure%2:31:00::
future
accommodations
for
a
school
population
that
we
know know%2:31:01::
will
increase increase%2:30:00::
.
If
they
are be%2:42:03::
to
be
commended commend%2:32:00::
for
foresight
in
their
planning
,
what
then
is be%2:42:03::
the
judgment
of
a
town
council
that
compounds compound%2:30:01::
this
problem
during
the
planning
stage
?
Where
then
is be%2:42:05::
the
sound
planning
and
cooperation
between
agencies
within
the
community
that
you
have
called_for call_for%2:32:04::
in
other
editorials
?
I
submit submit%2:32:00::
that
it
cannot
be
dismissed dismiss%2:32:00::
simply
by
saying say%2:32:00::
we
are
not
facing face%2:32:00::
the
facts
of
life
.
The
``
fruitful
course
''
of
metropolitanization
that
you
recommend recommend%2:32:01::
is
currently
practiced practice%2:41:01::
by
the
town
of
East_Greenwich
and
had have%2:30:01::
its
inception
long
before
we
learned learn%2:31:01::
what
it
was be%2:42:03::
called
.
For_example
:
The
East_Greenwich
Police_Department
utilizes utilize%2:34:00::
the
radio
transmission
facilities
of
the
Warwick
Police_Department
,
thereby
eliminating eliminate%2:30:01::
duplication
of
facilities
and
ensuring ensure%2:31:00::
police
coordination
in
the
Cowessett-East_Greenwich-Potowomut
area
of
the
two
communities
.
The
East_Greenwich_Fire_District
services service%2:41:00::
parts
of
Warwick
as_well
as
East_Greenwich
.
The
taxpayers
of
East_Greenwich
appropriate appropriate%2:31:00::
sums_of_money
,
as
do
other
Kent_County
communities
,
for
the
support
of
the
Kent_County_Memorial_Hospital
,
a
regional
facility
.
The
East_Greenwich_Free_Library
receives receive%2:40:00::
financial
support
from
the
town
of
East_Greenwich
and
the
City
of
Warwick
to
supplement supplement%2:40:00::
its
endowment
.
Feelers
were
put_out put_out_feelers%2:31:00::
last
year
to
the
City
of
Warwick
,
as
reported report%2:32:00::
in
your
newspapers
,
suggesting suggest%2:32:00::
investigation
of
a
common
rubbish
disposal
area
to
service service%2:41:00::
the
Potowomut
and
Cowessett
areas
of
Warwick
along
with
East_Greenwich
.
East_Greenwich
was be%2:42:03::
one
of
the
first
Rhode_Island
towns
to
enter enter%2:33:00::
into
contract
agreement
with
the
Rhode_Island
Development_Council
for
planning
services
we
could
not
provide provide%2:34:00::
for
ourselves
.
The
education
program
for
retarded
children
conducted conduct%2:41:00::
by
the
East_Greenwich
school_system
has have%2:40:00::
pupils
from
at_least
one
neighboring
community
.
I
feel feel%2:37:00::
compelled
to
write write%2:36:00::
this
because
I
am be%2:42:03::
greatly
concerned
with
the
problem
of
community
growth_rate
and
the
relation
between
types
of
growth
in
a
town
such_as
East_Greenwich
.
I
believe believe%2:31:04::
it
is be%2:42:03::
an
area
in_which
professional
planners
have
failed fail%2:41:02::
to
set set%2:31:04::
adequate
guide
posts
;
and
yet
they
cannot
ignore ignore%2:32:00::
this
problem
because
it
concerns concern%2:42:00::
the
implementation
of
nearly
all
the
planning
programs
they
have
devised devise%2:36:00::
.
These
programs
are be%2:42:03::
volumes
of
waste
paper
and
lost
hours
if
the
citizens
of
a
community
must
stand stand%2:42:04::
aside
while
land
developers
tell tell%2:32:00::
them
when
,
where
,
and
in_what_manner
the
community
shall
grow grow%2:30:00::
.
We
have have%2:40:00::
far
less
to
fear fear%2:37:03::
in
the
migrant
family
than
we
have have%2:40:00::
in
the
migrant
developer
under
these
conditions
.
Until
professional
planners
meet meet%2:41:02::
this
situation
squarely
and
update update%2:30:00::
the
concepts
of
zoning
in
a
manner
acceptable
to
the
courts
,
I
hope hope%2:37:01::
we
in
East_Greenwich
can
continue continue%2:42:01::
to
shape shape%2:31:00::
our
own
destiny
.
I
would
like like%2:37:01::
very_much
,
on
behalf
of
my
husband
and
myself
,
to
send send%2:32:02::
our
eternal
thanks
to
all
the
wonderful
people
responsible_for
the
Gabrielle_Fund
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
indeed
true
,
as
stated state%2:32:00::
in
the
famous
novel
of
our
day
,
``
For
Whom
the
Bell
Tolls

,
that
``
no

them
to

.
It
is be%2:42:03::
through

that
we
have

aware
of
the

I

Mount_Pleasant
High_School
.
My
future
plans
are be%2:42:06::
to

a
language
teacher
.
Of_course
,
having have%2:40:00::
this
desire
,
I
am be%2:42:03::
very
interested
in
education
.
A_few
weeks
ago
,
I
read read%2:31:00::
in
the
Bulletin
that
there
were be%2:42:04::
to
be
given give%2:36:02::
Chinese
classes
in
Cranston
.
The
article
also
said say%2:32:00::
that
a
person
had have%2:42:05::
to
be be%2:42:03::
18
years
old
or
over
,
and
must
not
be
going_to go_to%2:42:00::
high_school
to
attend attend%2:42:00::
these
classes
.
The
following
week
,
I
read read%2:31:00::
in
the
Sunday
paper
that
the
students
of
Russia
begin begin%2:30:00::
European
and
Asian
languages
in
the
seventh
grade
.
I
wish wish%2:32:02::
you
could
see see%2:31:00::
the
situation
as
I
see see%2:31:00::
it
.
If
Russian
pupils
have have%2:42:05::
to
take take%2:31:02::
these
languages
,
how_come
American
students
have have%2:40:00::
a
choice
whether
or
not
to
take take%2:31:02::
a
language
,
but
have have%2:42:05::
to
face face%2:32:00::
so
many
exceptions
?
I
do
not
think think%2:31:01::
that
America
is be%2:42:03::
like
Russia
,
not
in_the_least
!
I
am be%2:42:03::
proud
of
my
country
,
the
small
city
I
live live%2:42:08::
in
,
my
wonderful
parents
,
my
friends
and
my
school
;
but
I
am be%2:42:06::
also
a
young
,
able
and
willing
girl
who
wants want%2:37:00::
to
study study%2:31:03::
the
Chinese
language
but
is be%2:42:03::
not
old
enough
.
Then
people
wonder wonder%2:31:00::
why
Russian
pupils
are be%2:42:03::
more
advanced
than
American
students
.
Well
,
there
lies lie%2:42:00::
your
answer
.
At
the
height
of
the
first
snowstorm
we
had have%2:30:01::
,
it
was be%2:42:03::
impossible
for
me
to
get get%2:30:03::
medical
attention
needed
during
an
emergency
.
However
,
the
East_Providence_Rescue
Squad
made make_one's_way%2:38:00::
its
way
through
to
my
home
in_time
of
desperation
.
Words
cannot
tell tell%2:32:04::
of
the
undivided
attention
and
comfort
their
service
gave give%2:40:03::
to
me
.
The
concern
they
felt feel%2:37:00::
for
me
was be%2:42:03::
such_as
I
shall
never
forget forget%2:31:01::
and
for
which
I
will
always
be be%2:42:03::
grateful
.
The
rescue
squad
is
to
be
praised praise%2:32:00::
immensely
for
the
fine
work
they
do do%2:41:01::
in
all
kinds
of
weather
.
Had
they
not
gotten get%2:35:03::
me
to
the
hospital
when
they
did
,
perhaps
I
would
not
be be%2:42:05::
here
to
commend commend%2:32:00::
them
at
this
time
.
Many
thanks
for
a
job
well
done do%2:41:04::
.
The
Providence_Sunday_Journal
article
(
Jan.
29
)
asking ask%2:32:00::
whether
American
taxpayers
are
being
victimized victimize%2:41:01::
by
a
gigantic
giveaway
to
pay pay%2:40:00::
for
the
care
of
war
veterans
who
have have%2:29:02::
non-service-connected
disabilities
sounds sound%2:39:06::
as
though
The
Providence_Journal
is be%2:42:03::
desperate
for
news
.
Usually
a
veteran
has have%2:42:05::
to
hang hang%2:41:00::
himself
to
get get%2:30:03::
space
on
the
front
page
.
On
the
question
of
admission
to
Veterans_Administration
hospitals
of
service-connected
and
non-service-connected
disabled
veterans
,
it
must
be
recognized recognize%2:31:01::
that
there
are
many
men
who
are be%2:42:03::
greatly
affected
by
war
service
.
It
can
manifest manifest%2:32:00::
itself
before
discharge
from
service
,
or
it
can
come_out come_out%2:30:00::
years
later
.
There
is
one
other
point
we
should
never
lose lose%2:40:01::
sight
of
:
Many
veterans
who
enter enter%2:38:00::
VA
hospitals
as
non-service
cases
later
qualify qualify%2:42:00::
as
service-connected
.
No
psychiatrist
could
tell tell%2:32:04::
me
that
the
experience
in
a
war
can
not
have have%2:30:00::
its
effect
in
the
ensuing
years
.
The
arguments
advanced advance%2:38:01::
by
those
individuals
and
groups
who
oppose oppose%2:32:01::
the
system
in_force
and
who
would
drastically
curtail curtail%2:30:00::
or
do_away
entirely
with
hospital_care
for
the
non-service-connected
case
,
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
coldly
impractical
and
out-of-step
with
the
wishes
of
the
general
public
.
I
believe_in believe_in%2:31:01::
priority
for
service-connected
disabled
veterans
in
admission
to
VA
hospitals
.
But
I
do
n't
believe believe%2:31:04::
we
should
close close%2:35:00::
the
door
on
nonservice-connected
patients
.
This
matter
is be%2:42:03::
of
great
importance
,
and
the
outcome
may
mean mean%2:42:00::
the
difference
between
life
or
death
,
or
at_least
serious
injuries
,
for
many
veterans
.
Some
critics
say say%2:32:00::
that
the
length
of
stay
in
a
hospital
is be%2:42:03::
too
long
.
There
's
a
reason
for
this
length
of
stay
.
First_of_all
,
the
admitting
physician
in
the
VA
hospital
gets get%2:40:00::
the
patient
as
a
new
patient
.
He
has have%2:40:00::
no
experience
with
this
veteran
's
previous
medical_record
.
If
the
doctor
is be%2:42:03::
conscientious
,
he
wants want%2:37:00::
to
study study%2:31:02::
the
patient
.
As
a
result
,
it

The
American
public
must
be
presented present%2:32:01::
with
the
facts
concerning
VA
hospitalization

The
public
should

that
whether

a

Do

any

We

the
