,
or
failed fail%2:41:02::
to
do do%2:36:01::
,
in
the
Congo
since
1885
.
At_first
the
Belgian
royal_family
administered administer%2:41:00::
the
Congo
as
its
own
private_property

But
by
1908
its
record
of
brutality
had
touched touch%2:37:00::
the
national
conscience

The

government
itself
took_over take_over%2:40:06::
administration
,
commencing commence%2:30:01::
a
program
of
paternalism
unmatched
in

history

One
definition
of
paternalism
is be%2:42:03::
``
The
principle
or
practice
,
on
the
part
of

of

country
in
the
manner
of
a
father

with

''
.
The
honor
of
the
Belgians
in_this
matter
is be%2:42:03::
not
to
be
questioned question%2:32:02::
-
only
their
judgment
.
Ordinarily
a

grow_up grow_up%2:41:00::
in_due_time

but
when
the
colony
received receive%2:30:01::
independence

1960

Congolese
child

,
was be%2:42:03::
52
and
had
until
then
been
treated treat%2:41:00::
as
an
infant

The
Belgians
were be%2:42:03::
interested

in
the
economic
development
of
the
Congo
,
which
is be%2:42:03::
rich_in

The

was
administered administer%2:41:00::
from
Brussels
,
with
neither
the
Congolese
nor
the
resident
Belgians
having have%2:40:04::
any
vote
.
The
beneficiaries
of_this
administration
were be%2:42:08::
a_number_of
huge
cartels
in_which
both
individuals
and
the
Belgian
government
itself
held hold%2:40:00::
stock
.
In
Inside
Africa
,
John_Gunther
describes describe%2:32:01::
one
of
these
,
the
Societe_Generale
,
as
``
the
kind_of
colossus

might

with
the
United_States_government

heavy
partner
''
.
Had
they
been be%2:42:03::
truly
ruthless
,
the
Belgians
might
have
exploited exploit%2:34:00::
the
Congolese
without
compassion
.
But
they
were be%2:42:03::
not
.
They
provided provide%2:40:00::
a
social_security
system
which
covered cover%2:42:00::
all
their
African
employes
;
their
program
of
mass
medical_care
was be%2:42:03::
doubtless
the
best
on
the
continent
;
they
put put%2:35:05::
much
effort
into
public
housing
.
They
also
instituted institute%2:36:01::
a
ration
system
under
which
all
employers
in
the
Congo
were
required require%2:32:01::
to
furnish furnish%2:40:00::
their
employes
with
clothing
and
adequate
food
.
But
instead
of
delivering deliver%2:35:00::
the
ration
-
either
in
actual
commodities
or
in
cash
-
at
intervals
of
perhaps
two_weeks
or
a
month
,
the
Belgians
felt feel%2:37:00::
obliged
to
dole dole_out%2:40:00::
it
out
more_often
.
Would
not
the
children

food
on
the
first
day_of_the_month
,
eat eat%2:34:00::
it
up
immediately
,
and
later
go_hungry
?
The
Belgians
also
placed place%2:35:00::
great
emphasis
on
education
.
During
the
1950
s
there
were be%2:42:03::
as_many
as
25000
schools
in
the
Congo
.
But
almost
all
the
schools
were be%2:42:03::
primary
.
The
average
Congolese
can
do do%2:41:01::
little
more_than
puzzle_out puzzle_out%2:31:00::
the
meaning
of
``
la
chatte
''
and
``
le
chien
''
and
write write%2:36:03::
his
name
.
Some
schools
were be%2:42:03::
technical
-
the
Belgians
needed need%2:42:00::
carpenters
and
mechanics
to
help help%2:34:00::
exploit exploit%2:34:00::
the
land
,
and
trained train%2:41:01::
many
.
But
they
did
not
believe_in believe_in%2:31:01::
widespread
secondary
education
,
much
less
in
college
.
It
was be%2:42:06::
their
conviction
that
the
people
should
be
``
brought_up bring_up%2:41:00::
together
''
,
a
grade
at_a_time
,
until
in
some
indefinite
future
some
might
be be%2:42:03::
ready
to
tackle tackle%2:41:00::
history
,
economics
and
political_science
.
Indeed
,
the
Belgians
discouraged discourage%2:32:01::
higher
education
,
fearing fear%2:37:03::
the
creation
of
a
native
intellectual
elite
which
might
cause cause%2:36:00::
unrest
.
When
the
Congo
received receive%2:30:01::
its
independence
in
1960
there
were be%2:42:07::
,
among
its
13.5
million
people
,
exactly
14
university
graduates
.
Why
did
the
Belgians
grant grant%2:40:05::
independence
to
a
colony
so
manifestly
unprepared
to
accept accept%2:40:00::
it
?
In
one
large
oversimplification
,
it
might
be
said say%2:32:01::
that
the
Belgians
felt feel%2:39:00::
,
far
too
late
,
the
gale
of
nationalism
sweeping sweep%2:38:01::
Africa
.
They
lacked lack%2:42:00::
time
to
prepare prepare%2:30:00::
the
Congo
,
as
the_British
and
French
had
prepared prepare%2:30:00::
their
colonies
.
The
Congolese
were
clamoring clamor%2:32:03::
for
their
independence
,
even_though
most
were be%2:42:03::
unsure
what
it
meant mean%2:32:03::
;
and
in
Brussels
,
street
crowds
shouted shout%2:32:01::
,
``
Pas
une
goutte
de
sang
!
''
(
Not_one
drop
of
blood
!
)
.
The
Belgians
would
not
fight fight%2:33:00::
for
the
privilege
of
being be%2:42:06::
the
detested
pedagogue
;
rather_than
teach teach%2:32:00::
where
teaching
was
not
wanted want%2:37:00::
,
they
would
wash_their_hands
of
the
mess
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
hard
to
blame blame%2:32:00::
them
for
this
.
Yet
there
were
other
motivations
and
actions
which
the
Belgians
took take%2:41:04::
after
independence
for
which
history
may_not
find find%2:32:01::
them
guiltless
.
As
the
time
for
independence
approached approach%2:38:01::
there
were
in
the
Congo
no_fewer_than
120
political_parties
,
or
approximately
eight
for
each
university
graduate
.
There
were
four
principal
ones
.
First
,
there
were
those
Congolese
(
among
them
Joseph_Kasavubu
)
who
favored favor%2:41:00::
splitting split%2:41:03::
the
country
into
small
independent
states
,
Balkanizing balkanize%2:41:00::
it
.
Second
,
there
were
those
(
Moise_Tshombe
)
who
favored favor%2:41:00::
near-Balkanization
,
a
loose
federalism
having have%2:42:00::
a
central
government
of
limited
authority
,
with
much
power
residing reside%2:42:01::
in
the
states
.
Third
,
there
were
those
(
notably
Patrice_Lumumba
)
who
favored favor%2:41:00::
a
unified
Congo
with
a
very
strong
central
government
.
And
fourth
,
there
were
moderates
who
were be%2:42:03::
in
no
hurry
for
independence
and
wished wish%2:37:02::
to
wait wait%2:42:01::
until
the
Congo
grew_up grow_up%2:41:00::
.
However
,
the
positions
of
all
parties
and
leaders
were
constantly
shifting shift%2:30:00::
.
A
final
factor
which
contributed contribute%2:40:01::
greatly
to
the
fragmentation
of
the
Congo
,
immediately
after
independence
,
was be%2:42:06::
the
provincial
structure
that
had
been
established establish%2:31:02::
by
the
Belgians
for
convenience
in
administration
.
They
had
divided divide%2:41:00::
the
Congo
into
six
provinces
-
Leopoldville
,
Kasai
,
Kivu
,
Katanga
,
Equator
and
Eastern
-
unfortunately
with
little
regard
for
ethnic
groupings
.
Thus
some
provinces
contained contain%2:42:00::
tribes
which
detested detest%2:37:00::
each
other
,
and
to
them
independence
meant mean%2:32:03::
an
opportunity
for
war
.
The
Belgian_Congo
was
granted grant%2:40:00::
its
independence
with
what
seemed seem%2:39:00::
a
workable
Western-style
form_of_government
:
there
were
to
be
a
president
and
a
premier
,
and
a
bicameral
legislature
elected elect%2:41:00::
by
universal
suffrage
in
the
provinces
.
Well-wishers
around
the
world
hoped hope%2:37:00::
that
the
Congo
would
quickly
assume assume%2:41:00::
a
respectable
position
in
the
society
of
nations
.
If
internal
frictions
arose arise%2:42:00::
,
they
could
be
handled handle%2:41:00::
by
the
25000
-

army
,
the
Force_Publique
,
which
had
been
trained train%2:31:01::
and
was
still
officered officer%2:32:00::
by
white
Belgians
.
The
president
,
Joseph_Kasavubu
,
seemed seem%2:39:00::
an
able
administrator
and
the
premier
,
Patrice_Lumumba
,
a
reasonable
man
.
Twenty-four_hours
after
independence
the
wild
tribesmen
commenced commence%2:30:01::
fighting fight%2:33:00::
each
other
.
Presently
the
well-armed
members
of
the
Force_Publique
-
many_of
them
drawn draw%2:31:13::
from
savage
and
even
cannibalistic
tribes
,
erupted erupt%2:30:01::
in
mutiny
,
rioting
,
raping
and
looting
.
Terror
engulfed engulf%2:31:00::
the
thousands
of
Belgian
civilians
who
had
remained remain%2:42:03::
in

The
Belgian
government
decided decide%2:31:00::
to
act act%2:41:00::

and
on
July

On

The
