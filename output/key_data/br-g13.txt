Hemingway

in

D._H._Lawrence

in

The

the

But
for
the
beat_generation
all
is be%2:42:06::
sex
.
Nothing
is be%2:42:03::
more
revealing
of
the
way_of_life
and
literary
aspirations
of_this

than
their
attitude
toward

For
the

He

Lawrence_Lipton
,
in
The
Holy_Barbarians
,
stresses stress%2:32:00::
that
for
the
beat_generation
sex
is be%2:42:03::
more_than
a
source
of
pleasure
;
it
is be%2:42:06::
a
mystique
,
and
their
private
language
is be%2:42:03::
rich_in
the
multivalent
ambiguities
of
sexual
reference
so_that
they
dwell dwell%2:42:01::
in
a
sexualized
universe_of_discourse
.
The
singular
uncompromising
force
of
their
revolt
against
the
cult
of
restraint
is
illustrated illustrate%2:32:00::
by
their
refusal
to
dance dance%2:36:00::
in
a
public
place
.
The
dance
is be%2:42:03::
but
a
disguised
ritual
for
the
expression
of
ungratified
sexual_desire
.
For
this
reason
,
too
,
their
language
is be%2:42:03::
more
forthright
and
earthy
.
The
beatniks
crave crave%2:34:00::
a
sexual
experience
in_which
their
whole
being
participates participate%2:41:00::
.
It
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
they
resist resist%2:42:01::
the
lure
of
marriage
and
the
trap
of
domesticity
,
for
like
cats
they
are be%2:42:03::
determined
not
to
tame tame%2:30:00::
their
sexual
energy
.
They
withdraw withdraw%2:38:00::
to
the
underground
of
the
slums
where
they
can
defy defy%2:42:00::
the
precepts
of
legalized
propriety
.
Unlike
the
heroes
and
flappers
of
the
lost
generation
,
they
disdain disdain%2:37:00::
the
art
of
``
necking
''
and
``
petting
''
.
That
is be%2:42:03::
reserved
for
the
squares
.
If
they
avoid avoid%2:32:00::
the
use
of
the
pungent
,
outlawed
four-letter
word
it
is
because
it
is be%2:42:03::
taboo

it
is be%2:42:03::
sacred

As
Lipton
,
the
prophet
of
the
beat_generation
,
declares declare%2:32:00::
:
``
In
the
sexual
act
,
the
beat

filled
with
mana

the

This
is be%2:42:03::
far
from
the
vulgar
,
leering
sexuality
of
the
middle-class
square
in
heat
''
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
the
Holy_Grail
these
knights
of
the
orgasm
pursue pursue%2:35:00::
,
this
is be%2:42:06::
the
irresistible
cosmic
urge
to_which
they
respond respond%2:31:00::
.
If
Wilhelm_Reich
is be%2:42:06::
the
Moses
who
has
led lead%2:38:00::
them
out
of
the
Egypt
of
sexual
slavery
,
Dylan_Thomas
is be%2:42:06::
the
poet
who
offers offer%2:40:02::
them
the
Dionysian
dialectic
of
justification
for
their
indulgence
in
liquor
,
marijuana
,
sex
,
and
jazz
.
In_addition
,
they
have
been
converted convert%2:30:07::
to
Zen_Buddhism
,
with
its
glorification
of
all
that
is be%2:42:03::
``
natural
''
and
mysteriously
alive
,
the
sense
that
everything
in
the
world
is be%2:42:03::
flowing
.
Thus
,
paradoxically
,
the
beat
writers
resort resort%2:41:11::
to
``
religious
''
metaphors
:
they
are be%2:42:03::
in
search
of
mana
,
the
spiritual
,
the
numinous
,
but
not
anything
connected
with
formal
religion
.
What
they
are_after be_after%2:31:00::
is be%2:42:06::
the
beatific
vision
.
And
Zen_Buddhism
,
though
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
understand understand%2:31:00::
how
these
internal
contradictions
are
reconciled reconcile%2:30:00::
,
helps help%2:41:00::
them
in
their
struggle
to
achieve achieve%2:41:00::
personal
salvation
through
sexual
release
.
The
style
of
life
chosen choose%2:31:00::
by
the
beat_generation
,
the
rhythm
and
ritual
they
have
adopted adopt%2:40:02::
as
uniquely
their
own
,
is
designed design%2:36:02::
to
enhance enhance%2:30:00::
the
value
of
the
sexual
experience
.
Jazz
is be%2:42:03::
good
not_only
because
it
promotes promote%2:41:01::
wholeness
but
because
of
its
decided
sexual
effect
.
Jazz
is be%2:42:06::
the
musical
language
of
sex
,
the
vocabulary
of
the
orgasm
;
indeed
,
it
is
maintained maintain%2:32:00::
that
the
sexual
element
in
jazz
,
by
freeing free%2:40:02::
the
listener
of
his
inhibitions
,
can
have have%2:40:00::
therapeutic
value
.
That
is be%2:42:06::
why
,
the
argument
runs run%2:42:04::
,
the
squares
are be%2:42:03::
so
fearful
of
jazz
and
yet
perversely
fascinated
by
it
.
Instead
of
giving give%2:32:03::
themselves
spontaneously
to
the
orgiastic
release
that
jazz
can
give give%2:40:03::
them
,
they
undergo undergo%2:39:02::
psychoanalysis
or
flirt_with flirt_with%2:31:00::
mysticism
or
turn_to turn_to%2:30:00::
prostitutes

satisfaction

Thus
jazz
is
transmuted transmute%2:30:02::
into
something
holy
,
the
sacred
road
to
integration
of
being
.
Jazz
,
like
sex

is be%2:42:06::
a
mystique

It
is be%2:42:06::
not
a
substitute
for

a
dynamic

The

combined
with
marijuana

and_then

If

if
he
is be%2:42:03::
the
predestined
victim

then
he
