to

the

apologetically

``

Behind
this
reply
,
and
its
many
variations

is be%2:42:05::
the
ever-present
budget
problem
all
libraries
must
face face%2:32:00::
,
from
the
largest
to
the
smallest
.
What
to

out

What
to

for
adult
and
child
readers
,
for
lovers
of
fiction
and
nonfiction
,
for
a
clientele
whose
wants
are be%2:42:03::
incredibly
diversified
,
when
your
budget
is be%2:42:03::
pitifully
small
?
Most
library
budgets
are be%2:42:03::
hopelessly
inadequate
.
A
startlingly
high
percentage
do
not
exceed exceed%2:42:01::
$
500
annually
,
which
includes include%2:42:00::
the
librarian
's
salary
,
and
not
even
the
New_York
Public
has have%2:40:04::
enough
money
to
meet meet%2:34:00::
its
needs
-
this
in
the
world
's
richest
city
.
The
plight
of
a
small
community
library
is be%2:42:03::
proportionately
worse
.
Confronted confront%2:32:00::
with
this
situation
,
most
libraries
either
endure endure%2:39:00::
the
severe
limitations
of
their
budgets
and
do do%2:41:04::
what
they
can
with
what
they

,
or_else
depend_on depend_on%2:31:00::
the
bounty
of
patrons
and
local_governments
to
supplement supplement%2:40:00::
their
annual
funds
.
In
some
parts
of
the
country
,
however
,
a
co-operative
movement
has
begun begin%2:30:00::
to
grow grow%2:30:00::
,
under
the
wing
of
state_governments
,
whereby
,
with
the
financial
help
of
the
state
,
libraries
share share%2:40:02::
their
book
resources
on
a
county-wide
or
regional
basis
.
New_York
State
has have%2:42:00::
what
is be%2:42:03::
probably
the_most
advanced
of
these
co-operative
systems
,
so
well
developed
that
it
has
become become%2:42:01::
a
model
for
others
to
follow follow%2:36:00::
.
Because
it
is be%2:42:03::
so
large
a
state
,
with
marked
contrasts
in
population
density
,
the
organization
of
the
New_York
co-operative
offers offer%2:40:02::
a
cross-section
of
how
the
plan
works work%2:41:03::
.
At
one
extreme
are be%2:42:05::
the
systems
of
upper
New_York
State
,
where
libraries
in
two
or
more
counties
combine combine%2:40:00::
to
serve serve%2:41:00::
a
large
,
sparsely
populated
area
.
At
the
other
are be%2:42:05::
organizations
like
the
newly
formed
Nassau_Library_System
,
in
a
high-density
area
,
with
ample
resources
and
a
rapidly
growing grow%2:30:00::
territory
to
serve serve%2:41:00::
.
Both
these
types
,
and
those
in_between
,
are be%2:42:03::
in
existence
by
reason
of
a
legislative
interest
in
libraries
that
began begin%2:36:00::
at
Albany
as
early
as
1950
,
with
the
creation
by
the
legislature
of
county
library
systems
financed finance%2:40:00::
by
county
governments
with
matching
funds
from
the
state
.
It
was be%2:42:07::
a
step
in
the
right
direction
,
but
it
took take%2:42:00::
an
additional
act
passed pass%2:41:02::
in
1958
to
establish establish%2:36:00::
fully
the
thriving
systems
of
today
.
Under
this
law
annual
grants
are
given give%2:40:08::
to
systems
in
substantial
amounts
.
An
earlier
difficulty
was
overcome overcome%2:33:03::
by
making make%2:30:00::
it
clear
that
individual
libraries
in
any
area
might
join join%2:41:00::
or
not
,
as
they
saw see%2:31:00::
fit
.
Some
library
boards
are be%2:42:03::
wary
of
the
plan
.
A
large
,
well-stocked
library
,
surrounded
in
a
county
by
smaller
ones
,
may
feel feel%2:31:00::
that
the
demands
on
its
resources
are be%2:42:03::
likely
to
be be%2:42:03::
too
great
.
A
small
library
may
cherish cherish%2:37:00::
its
independence
and
established
ways
,
and
resist resist%2:42:01::
joining join%2:41:00::
in
a
cooperative
movement
that
sometimes
seems seem%2:39:00::
radical
to
older
members
of
the
board
.
Within
a
system
,
however
,
the
autonomy
of
each
member
library
is
preserved preserve%2:40:01::
.
The
local
community
maintains maintain%2:42:00::
responsibility
for
the
financial
support
of
its
own
library_program
,
facilities
,
and
services
,
but
wider
resources
and
additional
services
become become%2:30:00::
available
through
membership
in
a
system
.
All
services
are
given give%2:40:09::
without
cost
to
members
.
So
obvious
are be%2:42:03::
these
advantages
that
nearly
95
per_cent
of
the
population
of
New_York
State
now
has have%2:40:00::
access
to
a
system
,
and
enthusiastic
librarians
foresee foresee%2:36:00::
the
day
,
not
too
distant
,
when
all
the
libraries
in
the
state
will
belong_to belong_to%2:42:00::
a
co-op
.
To
set_up set_up%2:41:02::
a
co-operative
library
system
,
the
law
requires require%2:32:01::
a
central
book
collection
of
100000
nonfiction
volumes
as
the
nucleus
,
and
the
system
is
organized organize%2:30:00::
around
it
.
The
collection
may
be be%2:42:05::
in
an
existing
library
,
or
it
may
be
built build%2:30:00::
up
in
a
central
collection
.
Each
system
develops develop%2:42:00::
differently
,
according
to
the
area
it
serves serve%2:41:00::
,
but
the
universal
goal
is be%2:42:03::
to
pool pool%2:40:00::
the
resources
of
a
given
area
for
maximum
efficiency
.
The
basic
state
grant
is be%2:42:07::
thirty
cents
for_each_person
served serve%2:41:00::
,
and
there
is
a
further
book
incentive
grant
that
provides provide%2:40:00::
an
extra
twenty
cents
up_to
fifty
cents
per_capita
,
if
a
library
spends spend%2:40:00::
a
certain
number
of
dollars
.
In
Nassau_County
,
for_example
,
the
heavily
settled
Long_Island
suburb
of
New_York_City
,
the
system
is
credited credit%2:40:00::
by
the
state
with
serving serve%2:41:00::
one
million
persons
,
a
figure
that
has
doubled double%2:30:00::
since
1950
.
This
system
,
by
virtue
of
its
variety
and
size
,
offers offer%2:40:02::
an
inclusive
view
of
the
plan
in_operation
.
The
Nassau
system
recognizes recognize%2:31:01::
that
its
major
task

to
broaden broaden%2:30:01::

service
,
what
with
the
constant
expansion
of
education
and
knowledge

and
the
pressure

metropolitan

The
need
is be%2:42:03::
for

specialized
nature

individual
libraries

adequate_to
satisfy satisfy%2:34:01::

Nassau
is
currently

Hempstead
headquarters

which
will
reach reach%2:38:06::

The

Basic

approximately
