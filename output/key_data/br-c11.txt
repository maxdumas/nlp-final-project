Mischa_Elman
shared share%2:40:02::
last
night
's
Lewisohn_Stadium
concert
with
three
American
composers
.
His
portion
of
the
program
-
and
a
big
portion
it
was be%2:42:03::
-
consisted_of consist_of%2:42:00::
half
the
major
nineteenth-century
concertos
for
the
violin
:
to
wit
,
the
Mendelssohn
and
the
Tchaikovsky
.
That
is be%2:42:02::
an
evening
of
music-making
that
would
faze faze%2:37:00::
many_a
younger
man
;
Mr._Elman
is be%2:42:03::
70
years
old
.
There
were be%2:42:04::
8000
persons
at
the
Stadium
who
can
tell tell%2:32:04::
their
grandchildren
that
they
heard hear%2:39:00::
Elman
.
But
,
with
all
due
respects
and
allowances
,
it
must
truthfully
be
said say%2:32:00::
that
what
they
heard hear%2:39:00::
was be%2:42:03::
more
syrupy
than
sweet
,
more
mannered
than
musical
.
The
occasion
was be%2:42:03::
sentimental
;
so
was be%2:42:03::
the
playing
.
The
American
part
of
the
evening
consisted_of consist_of%2:42:00::
Paul_Creston
's
Dance_Overture
,
William_Schuman
's
``
Chester
''
from
``
New_England
Triptych
''
and
two
works
of
Wallingford_Riegger
,
Dance
Rhythms
,
Op.
58
,
and
a
Romanza
for
Strings
,
Op.
56
A
.
The
Creston
is be%2:42:03::
purely
a
potboiler
,
with
Spanish
,
English
,
French
and
American
dances
mixed
into
the
stew
.
The
Riegger
,
with
its
Latin
hesitation
bounce
,
is be%2:42:05::
just
this
side
of
the
pale
;
like
his
sweet
,
attractive
Romanza
,
it
belongs belong%2:42:01::
to
what
the
composer
called call%2:32:02::
his
``
Non-Dissonant
(
Mostly
)
''
category
of
works
.
The
Schuman
``
Chester
''
takes_off take_off%2:36:00::
from
an
old
William
Billings
tune
with
rousing
woodwind
and
brass
effect
.
All
these
-
potboilers
or
no
-
provided provide%2:40:00::
a
welcome
breath
of
fresh
air
in
the
form
of
lively
,
colorful
,
unstuffy
works
well
suited
for
the
great
out-of-doors
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
nice
to
have have%2:39:06::
something
a_little
up-to-date
for
a
change
.
We
have have%2:40:00::
Alfredo_Antonini
to
thank thank%2:32:00::
for
this
healthy
change
of
diet
as_well
as
the
lively
performances
of
the
Stadium_Symphony
.
A
woman
who
undergoes undergo%2:39:00::
artificial_insemination
against
the
wishes
of
her
husband
is be%2:42:06::
the
unlikely
heroine
of
``
A
Question
of
Adultery
''
,
yesterday
's
new
British
import
at
the
Apollo
.
Since
an
objective
viewer
might
well
conclude conclude%2:31:00::
that
this
is be%2:42:03::
not
a
situation
that
would
often
arise arise%2:30:00::
,
the
film
's
extensive
discussion
of
the
problem
seems seem%2:39:00::
,
at_best
,
superfluous
.
In
its
present
artless
,
low-budget
form
,
the
subject_matter
seems seem%2:39:00::
designed design%2:36:02::
to
invite invite%2:37:00::
censorial
wrath
.
With
Julie_London
enacting enact%2:36:00::
the
central
role
with
husky-voiced
sincerity
,
the
longsuffering
heroine
is be%2:42:03::
at_least
attractive
.
The
explanation
offered offer%2:40:02::
for
her
conduct
is be%2:42:06::
a
misguided
attempt
to
save save%2:41:01::
her
marriage
to
a
neurotic
husband
left leave%2:42:02::
sterile
as
a
result
of
an
automobile
accident
.
Anthony_Steel
,
as
the
husband
,
is be%2:42:03::
a
jealous
type
who
argues argue%2:32:00::
against
her
course
and
sues sue%2:41:00::
for
divorce
,
labeling label%2:32:01::
her
action
adulterous
.
The
actor
plays play%2:36:02::
his
role
glumly
under
the
lurid
direction
of
Don_Chaffey
,
as
do
Basil_Sydney
as
his
unsympathetic
father
and
Anton_Diffring
as
an
innocent
bystander
.
After
a
protracted
,
hysterical
trial
scene
more
notable
for
the
frankness
of
its
language
than
for
dramatic
credibility
,
the
jury
,
to
no
one
's
surprise
,
leaves leave%2:42:02::
the
legal
question
unresolved
.
When
the
husband
drops drop%2:30:01::
the
case
and
returns return%2:30:00::
to
his
wife
,
both
seem seem%2:39:00::
sorry
they
brought bring_up%2:36:00::
the_matter
up
in_the_first_place
.
So
was be%2:42:03::
the
audience
.
For
its
final
change
of
bill
in
its
London
season
,
the
Leningrad_State_Kirov_Ballet
chose choose%2:31:01::
tonight
to
give give%2:36:02::
one
of
those
choreographic
miscellanies
known
as
a
``
gala
program
''
at
the
Royal
Opera_House
,
Covent_Garden
.
No_doubt
the
underlying
idea
was be%2:42:06::
to
show show%2:31:00::
that
for
all
the
elegance
and
artistry
that
have
distinguished distinguish%2:31:02::
its
presentations
thus_far
,
it
too
could
give give%2:36:02::
a
circus
if
it
pleased please%2:37:01::
.
And
please please%2:37:00::
it
did
,
in
every
sense
of
the
word
,
for
it
had have%2:30:00::
the
audience
shouting shout%2:32:01::
much
of
the
time
in
a
manner
far
from
typical
of
London
audiences
.
At
the
end
of
the
program
,
indeed
,
there
was be%2:42:04::
a
demonstration
that
lasted last%2:42:00::
for
forty-five
minutes
,
and
nothing
could
stop stop%2:42:00::
it
.
Alexandre_Livshitz
repeated repeat%2:36:00::
a
fantastic
technical
bit
from
the
closing
number
,
``
Taras_Bulba
''
,
but
even
then
there
was be%2:42:04::
a
substantial
number
of
diehards
who
seemed seem%2:39:00::
determined
not
to
go_home go_home%2:38:00::
at_all
.
Only
a
plea
from
the
house
manager
,
John_Collins
,
finally
broke_up break_up%2:38:01::
the
party
.
But
for
all
the
manifest
intention
to
``
show_off show_off%2:39:00::
''
,
this
was be%2:42:03::
a
circus
with
a
difference
,
for
instead
of
descending descend%2:41:00::
in
quality
to
what
is be%2:42:03::
known
as
a
popular
level
,
it
added add%2:30:00::
further
to
the
evidence
that
this
is be%2:42:03::
a
very
great
dancing
company
.
The
``
Taras_Bulba
''
excerpt
is be%2:42:03::
a
rousing
version
of
Gogol
's
Ukrainian
folk-tale
choreographed choreograph%2:36:00::
by
Bo_Fenster
to
music
of
Soloviev-Sedoi
.
It
is
danced dance%2:36:00::
by
some
thirty-five
men
and
no
women
,
and
it
contains contain%2:42:00::
everything
in
the
books
-
lusty
comedy
,
gregarious
cavorting
,
and
tricks
that
only
madmen
or
Russians
would
attempt attempt%2:41:00::
to
make make%2:32:00::
the
human_body
perform perform%2:36:01::
.
Yuri_Soloviev
,
Oleg_Sokolov
,
Alexei_Zhitkov
,
Lev_Sokolov
,
Yuri_Korneyev
and
Mr._Livshitz
were be%2:42:06::
the
chief
soloists
,
but
everybody
on
stage
was be%2:42:03::
magnificent
.
At
the
other
extreme
in
character
was be%2:42:03::
the
half-hour
excerpt
from
the
Petipa-Minkus
ballet
``
Bayaderka
''
,
which
opened open%2:41:01::
the
evening
.
What
a
man
this
Petipa
was be%2:42:03::
!
And
why
do
we
in
the
West
know know%2:31:03::
so
few
of
his
ballets

This
scene
is be%2:42:03::
a
``
white
ballet
''
in_which
a
lovelorn
hero
searches search%2:35:00::
for
his
departed
love
's
spirit
among
twenty-eight
extraordinarily
beautiful
``
shadows
''
who
can
all
dance dance%2:38:01::
like
nothing
human
-
which
,
of_course
,
is be%2:42:03::
altogether
fitting
.
The
ensemble
enters enter%2:38:00::
in
a
long
adagio
passage
that
is be%2:42:03::
of
fantastic
difficulty
,
as_well
as
loveliness
,
and
adagio
is be%2:42:04::
the
general
medium
of
the
piece
.
Its
ballerina

Olga_Moiseyeva

some
brilliant
hits

the
work

A

Mr._White
in

This

Nostalgia
Week
at
Lewisohn_Stadium
,
which
had
begun begin%2:30:00::
with
the
appearance
of
the
70
-
year-old
Mischa_Elman
on
Tuesday
night
,
continued continue%2:42:01::
last
night
as
Lily_Pons
led lead%2:42:01::
the
list
of
celebrities
in
an
evening
of
French
operatic
excerpts

Miss_Pons
is be%2:42:03::
certainly
not
70

no

ever
is be%2:42:03::
-
and
yet
the
rewards

the
evening
again
lay lie%2:42:01::
more
in
paying pay%2:32:00::
tribute
to
a
great
figure
of
times

than
in

The
better
part
of
gallantry
might
be be%2:42:06::
,
perhaps
,
to
honor honor%2:41:01::
her
perennial
good_looks

gorgeous
rainbow-hued
gown

chide chide%2:32:00::

a
singer
through
quite
as_many
adventures
with
pitch
as
Miss_Pons
encountered encounter%2:38:00::
last
night

In_all
fairness
,
there
were be%2:42:04::
flashes
of
the
great
stylist
of
yesteryear
,
flashes
even
of
the
old
consummate
vocalism
.
One
such
moment
came come%2:30:01::
in
the
breathtaking
way
Miss_Pons
sang sing%2:36:01::
the
cadenza
to
Meyerbeer
's
``
Shadow_Song

The
years
suddenly
fell_away fall_away%2:30:01::
at
this
point

On_the_whole
,
however
,
one
must
wonder wonder%2:32:01::
at
just
what
it
is be%2:42:06::
that
forces force%2:36:00::
a
beloved
artist
to
besmirch besmirch%2:35:00::
her

reputation

on

Sharing share%2:40:02::
the
program
was
the
young
French-Canadian
tenor
Richard_Verreau
,
making
his
stadium
debut
on
this
occasion
.
Mr._Verreau
began begin%2:30:00::
shakily
,
with
a
voice
that
tended tend%2:42:00::
toward
an
unpleasant
whiteness
when
pushed push%2:32:01::
beyond
middle
volume
.
Later_on
this
problem
vanished vanish%2:30:00::
,
and
the
``
Flower_Song
''
from
Bizet
's
``
Carmen
''
was
beautifully
and
intelligently
projected project%2:39:00::
