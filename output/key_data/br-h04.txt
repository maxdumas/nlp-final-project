available
concerning concern%2:42:00::
the
subject
prior
to

.
Those
that
are be%2:42:03::
available
shed shed_light_on%2:31:00::
little
light
.
The
Registry
of
Motor_Vehicles
indicates indicate%2:32:00::
that
at_least
one
state
automobile
was
registered register%2:41:00::
as
far
back
as
1917
.
It
should
be be%2:42:03::
enough
to
say say%2:32:01::
that
the
practice
of
the
state
buying buy%2:40:00::
automobiles
is be%2:42:03::
at_least
forty
years
old
.
The
best
reason
that
can
be
advanced advance%2:32:00::
for
the
state
adopting adopt%2:40:00::
the
practice
was be%2:42:06::
the
advent
of
expanded
highway
construction
during
the
1920
s
and
'
30
s
.
At_that_time
highway_engineers
traveled travel%2:38:00::
rough
and
dirty
roads
to
accomplish accomplish%2:36:00::
their
duties
.
Using use%2:34:01::
privately-owned
vehicles
was be%2:42:03::
a
personal
hardship
for
such
employees
,
and
the_matter
of
providing provide%2:40:00::
state
transportation
was
felt feel%2:31:00::
perfectly
justifiable
.
Once
the
principle
was
established establish%2:36:00::
,
the
increase
in
state-owned
vehicles
came come%2:30:01::
rapidly
.
And
reasons
other_than
employee
need
contributed contribute%2:41:12::
to
the
growth
.
Table

vehicles

This
rate
of
increase
does
not

anything
in
itself
.
It
does
not
indicate indicate%2:32:01::
loose
management
,
ineffective
controls
or
poor
policy

But
it
does
show show%2:39:02::
that
automobiles
have
increased increase%2:30:00::
steadily
over
the
years
and
in
almost
the
same
proportion
to
the
increase
of
state
employees
.
In_the_past
twenty
years
the
ratio
of
state-owned
automobiles
per
state
employees
has
varied vary%2:30:01::
from
1
to
22
then
to
1
to
23
now
.
Whether
there
were be%2:42:00::
too
few
automobiles
in
1940
or
too
many
now
is be%2:42:03::
problematical
.
The
fact
is be%2:42:03::
simply
that
state-owned
vehicles
have
remained remain%2:30:00::
in
practically
the
same
proportion
as

While
the
origin
of
state-owned
automobiles
may
be
obscured obscure%2:39:00::
,
subsequent
developments
concerning concern%2:42:00::
the
assignment
,
use
,
and
management
of
state
automobiles
can
be_related
more
clearly
.
Prior
to
1942
,
automobiles
were be%2:42:06::
the
individual

of
the
agency
to_which

This

It

,
where
gasoline
and
automobile
services
were
to
be
obtained obtain%2:40:00::
and
other
allied
matters
.
In
1942
,
however
,
the
nation
was be%2:42:03::
at_war
.
Gasoline
and
automobile_tires
were be%2:42:03::
rationed
commodities
.
The
state
was
confronted confront%2:32:03::
with
transportation
problems
similar
to
those
of
the
individual
.
It
met meet%2:41:02::
these
problems
by
the
creation
of
the
state
automobile
maintenance
unit
(
more
popularly
called
the
motor_pool
)
,
a
centralized
operation
for
the
maintenance
and
control
of
all
state
transportation
.
The
motor_pool
then
,
as
now
,
had have%2:42:00::
headquarter
facilities
in
Providence
and
other
garages
located
throughout
the
state
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
organizationally
the
responsibility
of
the
Department
of
Public_Works
and
was
financed finance%2:40:00::
on
a
rotary
fund
basis
with
each
agency
of
government
contributing contribute%2:40:00::
to
the
pool
's
operation
.
In
1951
the
pool
's
operation
was
transferred transfer%2:41:00::
to
the
newly-created
Department
of
Administration
,
an
agency
established establish%2:41:00::
as
the
central
staff
and
auxiliary
department
of
the
state_government
.
The
management
of
state-owned
vehicles
since
that
time
has
been
described describe%2:32:01::
in
a
recent
report
in
the
following
manner
:
``
Under
this
new
management
considerable
progress
appears appear%2:39:00::

are

for
the
actual
cost
of
services
provided provide%2:40:00::
to

Whereas
the

had
in_the_past
sustained sustain%2:29:00::

considerably

the
introduction

control

in

the

One
indication

the
merits

the
new

In_order_to
further
refine refine%2:30:01::
the
management
of
passenger
vehicles
,
on
July_1

1958

the

the
lowest
responsible
bidders
.
Unit
prices
for
state
vehicles
are be%2:42:03::
invariably
lower
than
to
the
general
public
.
The
reasons
are be%2:42:03::
obvious
:
(
1
)
the
state
is
buying buy%2:40:00::
in
quantity
,
and
(
2
)
it
has have%2:40:00::
no
federal
excise
or
state
sales_tax
to
pay pay%2:40:00::
.
Until
1958
the
state
was be%2:42:03::
also
entitled
to
a
special
type
of
manufacturers
'
discount
through
the
dealers
.
In_that
ownership
of
all
vehicles
rests rest_on%2:42:00::
with
the
state
motor_pool
,
cars
are
paid pay%2:40:00::
for
with
funds
appropriated appropriate%2:31:00::
to
the
agencies
but
transferred transfer%2:40:01::
to
the
rotary
fund
mentioned mention%2:32:02::
earlier
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
a
normal
governmental
procedure
which
reflects reflect%2:39:01::
more
accurately
cost-accounting
principles
.
The
assignment
and
use
of
vehicles
after
purchase
is be%2:42:06::
another
matter
to
be
covered cover%2:32:01::
in_detail
later
.
Probably
the_most
important
of
all
matters
for
review
are be%2:42:06::
the
broad
administrative
policies
governing govern%2:41:02::
the
purchase
,
assignment
,
use
,
and
management
of
state
vehicles
.
The
legislature
's
role
in
policy
determination
in_this
area
for
years
has
been
confined confine%2:30:01::
almost
solely
to
the
amount
of
funds
appropriated appropriate%2:31:00::
annually
for
the
purchase
and
operation
of
vehicles
.
The
more
meaningful
policies
have
been_left
to
the
judgment
of
the
chief
administrative
officer
of
the
state
-
the
Director
