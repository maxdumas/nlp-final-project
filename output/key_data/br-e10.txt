here

you
.
You
've
probably
given
a_lot_of
Christmas-season
thought
to
the
guns
in
your
rack
,
but
it
's be%2:42:03::
not
easy
to
decide decide%2:31:00::
on
a
new
one
.
You
still
have have%2:40:01::
time
to
drop drop%2:32:00::
a_few
hints
about
the
gifts
you
'd

;
the
time
to

on
them
is be%2:42:06::
now
.
As
a
Christmas
service
,
I
've
taken take_a_look%2:39:00::
a
close
look
at
this
year
's
crop
of
new
models
.
Here
they
are be%2:42:04::
,
with
my
comments
and
judgments
.
Read read%2:31:00::
on
,
take take%2:31:01::
your
pick
-
and
start start%2:30:00::
dropping drop%2:32:00::
those
hints
.
First
on
my
own
list
would
be be%2:42:05::
two
arms
-
a
rifle
and
a
handgun
-
that
qualify qualify%2:42:00::
as
new
in
the
strictest
sense
.
For
me
,
a
changed
barrel
length
or
an
improved
stock
does
n't
constitute constitute%2:42:00::
a
truly
new
design
.
Such
modifications
are be%2:42:03::
all
for
the
best
but
it
takes take%2:42:00::
something
as
different
as
a
Deerstalker
or
a
Jet
to
change change%2:30:01::
arms-making
concepts
.
Bill_Ruger
's
long-awaited
Deerstalker
(
under
$
110
)
is be%2:42:03::
a
new
rifle
action
in
a
caliber
that
upsets upset%2:30:00::
all
the
modern
theory
of
high-velocity
fans
;
it
's be%2:42:03::
a
short
,
light
,
quick-handling
,
fast-firing
little
timber
gun
designed design%2:31:00::
to
push push%2:38:00::
a
heavy
slug
at
modest
velocity
but
with
lots_of
killing
power
and
ample
range
for
our
most
popular
big_game
-
whitetail
.
Ruger
reports report%2:32:00::
that
on
his
recent
African
safari
the
little
.44
Magnum
cartridge
was be%2:42:03::
a
real
work
horse
.
Small
antelope
were
generally
grassed grass%2:33:00::
with
one_shot
,
and
the
.44
Magnum
carbine
also
bagged bag%2:35:01::
reedbuck
,
kob
and
wart
hog
with
deadly
efficiency
;
these
are be%2:42:03::
fairly
large
,
tough
animals
.
The
deadliness
of
the
.44
Magnum
in
a
rifle
comes come%2:42:01::
as
no
surprise
to
me
.
At_least
five
years
ago
,
Tom_Robinson
of
Marlin
made_up make_up%2:36:03::
an
over
/
under
double
rifle
for
me
in_this
caliber
,
using use%2:34:01::
the
now
defunct
Model
90
action
in
20
-
gauge
size
.
After
figuring_out figure_out%2:31:00::
how
to
regulate regulate%2:30:00::
the
barrels
so_that
they
shot shoot%2:33:00::
to
the
same
point
of
impact
,
we
fired fire%2:33:00::
this
little
20
-
inch-barrel
job
on
my
home_range
and
in
Marlin
's
underground
test
gallery
.
We
quickly
ran_into ran_into%2:38:01::
the
same
trouble
that
plagued plague%2:37:00::
Bill_Ruger
in
his
first
experiments
:
Three
or
four
bullets
would
be
placed place%2:35:00::
well
in
a
six-inch
bull
at
100
yards
and_then
,
unaccountably
,
one
could
stray stray%2:38:02::
far
out
of
the
group
.
Ruger
learned learn%2:31:01::
that
this
was be%2:42:04::
because
the
higher
velocity
achieved achieve%2:41:00::
in
a
long
barrel
was
upsetting upset%2:30:00::
the
shape
of
the
unjacketed
revolver
bullet
.
The
new
,
jacketed
slug
in
.44
Magnum
corrected correct%2:41:01::
this
.
But
even
without
jacketed
bullets
,
I
had have%2:40:00::
enough
faith
in
my
double
to
take take%2:38:10::
it
on
an
opening-day
deer
hunt
that
first
year
.
Within
half
an
hour
I
jumped jump%2:38:04::
a
six-point
buck
that
hop-skipped hop-skip%2:38:00::
through
a
rhododendron
thicket
,
and
I
caught catch%2:35:13::
him
just
behind
the
left
foreleg
at
60
yards
.
He
moved move%2:38:03::
only
about
30
feet
after
the
240
-
grain
slug
hit hit%2:35:01::
him
-
and
this
was be%2:42:04::
after
the
bullet
had
passed_through pass_through%2:38:01::
a
sapling
.
Three
more
deer
have
fallen fall%2:42:00::
to
this
same
gun
,
and
all
were be%2:42:03::
one-shot
kills
.
My
double
was
made make%2:36:01::
with
standard-weight
revolver
barrels
(
before
cutting cut%2:35:00::
to
revolver
length
)
,
and
although
it
compares compare%2:42:00::
well
in_other_respects
,
it
's be%2:42:03::
considerably
heavier
than
the
Deerstalker
,
which
only
scales scale%2:42:00::
about
6
-
1
2
pounds
.
If
ever
a
rifle
met meet%2:34:00::
the
needs
of
the
whitetail
hunter
,
this
is be%2:42:06::
it
.
The
Deerstalker
points point%2:33:00::
with
the
ease
,
speed
and
precision
of
a
fine
imported
double
shotgun
,
and
its
trigger
pull
is be%2:42:03::
light
and
sharp
.
The
240
-
grain
bullet
leaves leave%2:38:01::
the
muzzle
at
1850
fps
,
which
gives give%2:40:03::
it
all
the
smash
needed need%2:42:00::
at
woods
ranges
.
With
five
shots
at
the
immediate
command
of
the
hunter
's
trigger
finger
,
the
gun
and
load
are be%2:42:06::
a
deadly
combination
.
The
second
really
new
development
this
year
was be%2:42:06::
a
revolver
handling handle%2:41:00::
a
different
sort_of
varmint
load
-
the
.22
Remington_Jet
Magnum
Center_Fire
.
At_present
it
's be%2:42:03::
available
in
one
model
,
the
fine
and
familiar
Smith
+
Wesson
Magnum
revolver
(
about
$
110
)
,
long
a
top-quality
handgun
among
target
arms
.
The
velocity
of_this
.22
-
caliber
,
40
-
grain
bullet
is
rated rate%2:31:00::
at
a
very
hot
2460
fps
,
and
it
's be%2:42:06::
the
flattest
shooting
of
any
revolver
cartridge
,
with
a
mid-range
rise
of
about
an
inch
over
a
100
-
yard
range
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
a
varmint
load
,
pure_and_simple
;
it
's be%2:42:03::
much
too
explosive
for
small
edible
game
.
It
can
cut cut%2:35:00::
a
red_squirrel
neatly
in
two
or
burst burst%2:30:00::
a
crow
into
a
flurry
of
feathers
.
The_most
intriguing
aspect
of
the
S
+
W
Magnum
chambered chamber%2:42:00::
for
the
new
Jet
is be%2:42:06::
that
it
can
also
fire fire%2:33:01::
standard
.22
rim-fires
by
means
of
adapter
sleeves
in
the
chambers
.
You
may
therefore
convert convert%2:30:00::
the
gun
into
a
small-game
and
plinking
arm
,
although
the
difference
in
the
point
of
impact
(
Jet
vs.
rim-fire
)
can
be be%2:42:03::
somewhat
disconcerting
.
The
accuracy
of
the
Jet
cartridge
is be%2:42:03::
fine
;
I
tested test%2:41:00::
it
in
my
scoped
S
+
W
and
it
was be%2:42:03::
good
enough
to
allow allow%2:41:00::
me
to
hit hit%2:35:01::
a
chuck
with
every
shot
at
100
yards
if
I
did do%2:41:01::
my
part
by
holding hold%2:35:00::
the
handgun
steadily
.
The
fact
that
the
Deerstalker
and
the
Jet
were be%2:42:03::
the
only
completely
new
designs
this
year
does
n't
mean mean%2:42:00::
that
1961
did
n't
see see%2:39:02::
changes
in
models
,
actions
and
calibers
.
Aside
from
the
Ruger
carbine
,
a_number_of
hunting
rifles
have
been
introduced introduce%2:36:00::
for_the_first_time
.
Here
are be%2:42:05::
the
brands
(
in_alphabetical_order
)
and
the
new
models
.
Newcomers
to
the
American
hunter
are be%2:42:06::
the
Browning
group
of
bolt-action
,
high-power
rifles
.
They
have have%2:42:00::
fine
FN
actions
and
a
better-than-average
finish
on
both
the
metal
and
the
stock
wood
.
Barrel
weights
vary vary%2:42:01::
sensibly
with
the
various
calibers
available
,
and
these
include include%2:42:00::
the
standard
bores
(
about
$
165
)
plus
the
Magnums
(
around
$
170
)
;
the
latter
include include%2:42:00::
the
.264

.338
,
.375
and
.458
.
Shotgun-type
rubber
recoil
pads
are be%2:42:03::
standard
on
all_of
the
Magnums
except
the
.264
.
Stock
designs
are be%2:42:03::
excellent
for
use
with
scopes
.
Colt
's
center-fire
1961
rifles
are
all
made make%2:36:01::
with
Sako
actions
,
regardless_of
caliber
.
The
.222
's
have have%2:42:00::
the
short
action
;
the
.243
and
.308
,
the
medium
action
,
and
the
.270
,
*
*
f
and
the
Magnums
,
the
long
action
(
about
$
135
for
the
Standard
Coltsman
and
$
200
for
the
Custom
version
)
.
Previously
,
FN
actions
were
used use%2:34:01::
for
the
larger
cartridges
.
High
standard
has
introduced introduce%2:36:00::
a
.22
auto
,
the
Sport-King
,
in
two
grades
-
field
and
special
(
less_than
$
45
and
just
over
$
45
,
respectively
)
.
It
's be%2:42:03::
a
streamlined
rifle
,
fast
and
well-made
.
Among
.22
Magnum
Rim-Fire
rifles
,
1961
's
lone
newcomer
was be%2:42:06::
the
Kodiak
Model
260
autoloader
(
around
$
60
)
.
Previously
known
as
Jefferson_Arms
,
Kodiak
has
given give%2:40:03::
this
11
-
shot
hammerless
job
an
exceptionally
fine
stock
design
,
and
the
260
is be%2:42:03::
the
first
autoloader
to
handle handle%2:41:00::
.22
Magnum
rim-fires
.
Marlin
has
made make%2:36:12::
two
contributions
to
the
harvest
of
new
offerings
.
The
Model
99
(
under
$
45
)
is be%2:42:06::
a
light-weight
,
streamlined
.22
rim-fire
auto
with
a
tubular
magazine
that
holds hold%2:35:01::
18
Long
Rifles
.
It
's be%2:42:03::
extremely
accurate
for
an
auto
,
and
the
test
rifle
I
tried try%2:41:01::
was be%2:42:03::
completely
trouble-free
in
functioning
.
The
989
(
about
$
40
)
is be%2:42:03::
an
even
newer
.22
auto
,
this
one
with
a
seven
-
or
12
-
shot
clip
.
Once_again
the
Mossberg
Targo
outfit
has
appeared appear%2:30:00::
,
but
this
time
as
a
bolt-action
rifle-shotgun
combination
.
The
bore
is be%2:42:03::
unrifled
but
is
provided provide%2:40:00::
with
an
insert
tube
which
is be%2:42:03::
rifled
and
which
,
surprisingly
,
gives give%2:40:05::
pretty
fair
accuracy
even_though
it
's be%2:42:03::
only
3
-
1
2
inches
long
.
You
can
unscrew unscrew%2:35:00::
this
tube
and
replace replace%2:30:00::
it
with
a
smoothbore
insert
for
use
with
.22
shotshells
-
to
break break%2:35:01::

little
Targo
clay
targets
.
A
trap
for
throwing throw%2:35:00::
these
miniature
clays
fastens fasten%2:35:00::
to
the
barrel
so_that
the
shooter
can
throw throw%2:35:00::
his
own
targets
.
A
spring
trap
for
solid
mounting
and
a
regular
hand
trap
are be%2:42:03::
also
available
.
You
can
have have%2:40:00::
your
choice
of
a
seven-shot
repeater
,
the
340
TR
(
about
$
40
)
or
a
single-shot
,
the
320
TR
(
$
10
less
)
.
The
Targo
is be%2:42:03::
a
good
outfit
for
fun
shooting
or
for
economic
wing-shooting
practice
,
but
it
's be%2:42:03::
tougher
than
it
looks look%2:39:01::
to
run_up run_up%2:30:00::
a
score
on
the
clay
birds
.
They
'll
travel travel%2:38:00::
50
feet
or
more
when
thrown throw%2:35:00::
from
the
spring
trap
but
it
's be%2:42:03::
almost
impossible
to
break break%2:35:01::
one
after
it
passes pass%2:38:05::
the
35

foot

.
The
combination
of
thin
pattern
and
very
tiny
pellets
makes
it
necessary
to
get_on
the_birds
,
right_now
!
Big
Magnum
calibers
appeared appear%2:30:00::
in
the
Remington
line

with
the

of
the

These

A
shortened
version
of
the
highly
regarded
Remington
742
autoloader
also
appeared appear%2:30:00::
in
1961

This

more
for
a
deluxe

has have%2:42:00::

and
was
obviously
inspired inspire%2:32:00::
by
the
popularity
of
last
year
's
Model
760
pump
with
a
short-barrel
.
This
design
is be%2:42:03::
hard
to
beat beat%2:33:00::
for
timber
hunting
or
for
packing pack%2:35:00::
in
a
saddle
scabbard
.
Presently
,
the
742
C
is be%2:42:03::
available

The
latest

of
the

Deluxe
(
under
$
135
)
,
which
have have%2:42:00::
a
top-tang
safety
and
improved
trigger
design
.
The
replacement
of
the
slide-lock
side
safety_catch
will
make make%2:30:00::
this
lever-action
favorite
more
appealing
than
ever
since
the
new
safety
is be%2:42:03::
easier
and
faster
to
operate operate%2:35:00::
.
A
fresh
crop
of
beginners
'
guns
showed_up show_up%2:30:00::

they
're be%2:42:03::

list
if
you
're
wondering wonder%2:31:00::
what
to
get get%2:40:00::
for
a
youngster

The_most
unusual
of
them
is be%2:42:06::
the
Ithaca

$
5
for
a
saddle

single-shot
patterned pattern%2:36:00::
after
the
famous
Winchester
lever-action
and
featuring feature%2:42:01::

Because
of
its
traditional
lines
,
it
probably
has have%2:42:00::
more
kid
appeal
than
any
other
model

The

is be%2:42:06::
a
drop-block

for
the
beginning

it
's be%2:42:03::
a
full-sized
rifle
with
plenty
of
