It
is be%2:42:07::
a
good
eight
years
now
since
each
of
us
acquired acquire%2:40:00::
a
swimming_pool
-
eight
enlightening
,
vigorous
,
rigorous
,
not
wholly
unrewarding
years
.
We
have
learned learn%2:31:00::
a_lot
-
a
dash
of
hydrochemistry
here
,
a_bit
about
plumbing
and
pump-priming
there
.
We
have
had have%2:39:06::
sound
grounding
in
the
principles
of
the
mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove
school
of
diplomacy
.
We
have
become become%2:30:00::
amateur
insurance
experts
and
fine-feathered
yard
birds
.
True
,
our
problems
have
lessened lessen%2:30:00::
a_bit
as
more_and_more
of
our
neighbors
have
built build%2:36:00::
their
own
pools
,
thereby
diluting dilute%2:30:00::
our
spectacular
attractions
.
But
problems
cling_to cling_to%2:35:00::
pools
,
as
any
pool
owner
knows know%2:31:03::
.
So
our
innate
generosity
of
spirit
prompts prompt%2:32:00::
us
to
share share%2:32:00::
our
trials
,
errors
and
solutions
with
any
who
are
taking take%2:39:00::
the
pool
plunge
for_the_first_time
-
in
the
pious
hope
that
some
may
profit profit%2:40:02::
from
our
experience
.
Position
may
not
be be%2:42:06::
everything
,
but
in
the
case
of
a
pool
it
can
certainly
contribute contribute%2:40:01::
difficulties
,
social
and
/
or
physical
.
We
speak speak%2:32:01::
from
varying
viewpoints
.
One
of
us
has have%2:40:00::
a
pool
set
in
a
wooded
area
very
near
the
house
.
The
other
has have%2:40:00::
his
pool
far
away
from
the
house
in
a
field
high
on
a
hill
.
If
you
are
dreaming dream%2:36:00::
of
a
blue
,
shimmering
pool
right
outside
your
living_room
windows
,
close close%2:35:00::
your
eyes
firmly
and
fill_in fill_in%2:36:00::
the
picture
with
lots
and
lots_of
children
,
damp
towels
,
squashed
tubes
of
suntan
oil
and
semi-inflated
plastic
toys
.
You
are be%2:42:03::
likely
to
be be%2:42:03::
nearer
the
truth
.
You
can
also
see see%2:31:01::
that
the
greater
the
proximity
of
the
pool
to
your
main
living_quarters
,
the
greater
the
chance
for
violation
of
family
privacy
,
annoying
noise
and
the
let
's
-
make-your-house-our-club
attitude
.
On_the_other_hand
,
out-of-sight
does
not
lead lead%2:42:04::
to
out-of-mind
when
children
cannot
be
easily
observed observe%2:39:00::
and
you
have_to
make make%2:41:00::
a
long
trek
to
reach reach%2:38:01::
the
pool
.
Another
dilemma
:
As
picturesque
as
a
sylvan
pond
in
the
forest
may
be be%2:42:03::
,
trees
offer offer%2:40:02::
a
leaf
and
root
hazard
to
the
well-being
of
a
pool
.
Yet
a
grassy
approach
can
turn turn_into%2:42:00::
a
pool
into
a
floating
lawn
every
time
the
grass
is
mowed mow%2:35:00::
.
As
in
choosing choose%2:31:00::
a
wife
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
only
sensible
to
consider consider%2:39:00::
also
how
appealing
a
pool
is_likely
to
be be%2:42:03::
in
bad_weather
as_well
as
in
good
.
In
the
colder
climes
,
for_instance
,
you
will
have_to
live live%2:31:00::
through
the
many
unglamorous
winter
months
when
your
pool
will
hardly
look look%2:39:01::
its
best
.
It
may
be be%2:42:06::
a
big
hole_in_the_ground
filled
with
salt
hay
,
or
an
ice_floe
studded stud%2:42:00::
with
logs
.
Even
a
neat
,
plastic-covered
plunge
is be%2:42:03::
not
exactly
a
joy
to
behold behold%2:39:00::
.
(
We
do
,
however
,
recommend recommend%2:32:01::
those
patented
covers
to
prevent prevent%2:41:01::
both
people
and
junk
-
flora
and
fauna
generally
-
from
accidentally
wintering winter%2:42:00::
in
the
pool
.
)
Probably
no
location
for
a
pool
is be%2:42:03::
perfect
on
all
counts
.
Naturally
it
will
be
dictated dictate%2:32:00::
to
a
large
extent
by
the
shape
and
size
of
your
land
.
But
if
space
and
money
are be%2:42:03::
no
problem
and
small
children
are be%2:42:03::
not
on_hand
every_day
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
certainly
more
restful
to
have have%2:30:00::
your
pool
and
entertainment
area
removed remove%2:30:00::
from
the
immediate
environs
of
the
house
.
And
a
good
several
feet
around
the
pool
should
be be%2:42:04::
neither
greensward
nor
woods
,
but
good
hard
pavement
.
The
placement
of
your
pool
,
however
,
will
not
of
itself
solve solve%2:31:00::
the
two
major
problems
of
pool
owning
-
those
that
involve involve%2:42:01::
your
social
life
and
those
pertaining pertain%2:42:01::
to
safety
.
Coping_with cope_with%2:41:00::
them
demands demand%2:42:00::
stern
discipline
-
of
yourself
as_well
as
of
your
family
,
neighbors
,
friends
and
anyone
you
ever
talked talk%2:32:01::
to
on
a
transoceanic
jet
.
Eight
years
ago
while
we
were
going_through go_through%2:39:00::
the
mud-sweat-and-tears
construction
period
,
we
were
each
solaced solace%2:37:00::
by
the
vision
of
early
morning
dips
and
evening
home-comings
to
a
cool
family
collected collect%2:35:00::
around
the
pool
with
a
buffet
table
laid_out lay_out%2:35:00::
nearby
for
the
lord
and
master
's
delectation
.
But
not
even
our
first
pool-side
gatherings
came come%2:30:03::
anywhere
near
those
rosy
fantasies
.
We
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
be
witnessing witness%2:39:01::
the
population
explosion
right
in
our
own
backyards
.
Our
respective
families
looked look%2:39:01::
as
if
they
had
quadrupled quadruple%2:30:00::
.
Had
we
taken take%2:40:03::
a
lien
on
a
state
park
?
Not_at_all
.
We
had
merely
been
discovered discover%2:31:01::
by
the
pool
sharks
.
We
were
in
business
!
From
proud
pool-owners
to
perpetual
hosts
and
handymen
was be%2:42:03::
a
short
step
-
no_more_than
the
change
from
city
clothes
to
trunks
.
Nai
^
ve
of
us
,
maybe
,
but
the
results
of
our
impulsive
invitations
to
``
come come%2:38:04::
over
next
summer
and
swim swim%2:38:00::
in
our
new
pool
''
were be%2:42:03::
both
unexpected
and
unsettling
.
After
the
first
few
weeks
,
it
was be%2:42:03::
obvious
that
rules
had_to
be
made make%2:36:00::
,
laid_down lay_down%2:31:00::
and
obeyed obey%2:41:00::
-
even
if
our
popularity
ratings
became become%2:30:00::
subnormal
as
a
result
.
So
rules
we
made make%2:36:00::
,
in
unabashed
collusion
.
Since
our
viewpoints
in_this
respect
coincided coincide%2:42:01::
precisely
,
we
present present%2:32:00::
the
fruits
of
our
efforts
herewith
as
a
single
social
code
for
pool
owners
.
First_and_foremost
:
No
one
-
no
,
not
anyone
-
in
the
family
is
allowed allow%2:40:00::
to
issue
blanket
invitations
to
his
or
her
own
circle
.
Just
short
of
forty
lashes
we
finally
managed
to
coerce coerce%2:41:00::
our
children
to
this
view
.
Their
friends
and
ours
are be%2:42:03::
welcome
to
share share%2:40:02::
the
pool
,
but
on
our
terms
and
at
our
times
.
No
friends
are
to
arrive arrive%2:38:00::
without
an
invitation
or
without
at_least
telephoning telephone%2:32:00::
beforehand
.
No
ringers
,
either
-
even
if
they
are
trailing trail%2:38:00::
legitimate
invitees
.
We
want_to
know know%2:31:01::
when
the
Potlatches
telephone
exactly
how
many
they
are
planning
to
bring bring%2:38:00::
,
so_that
we
won
n't
end_up end_up%2:30:01::
with
a
splashing
mob
that
looks_like look_like%2:42:00::
Coney_Island
in
August
.
No
young
children
may
come come%2:38:04::
without
adults
except
for
a
specific
,
organized
,
chaperoned
party
.
And
accompanying
adults
are
urged urge%2:32:00::
to
keep keep_an_eye_on%2:41:00::
an
alert
and
sensible
eye
on
their
responsibilities
.
A
gaggle
of
gabbling
mothers
,
backs
to
the
pool
,
is be%2:42:03::
no
safeguard
.
No
bottle
pool
is
tolerated tolerate%2:31:00::
-
bottle
pool
being be%2:42:06::
our
lingo
for
those
who
come come%2:38:04::
to
swim swim%2:38:00::
and
sink sink%2:35:00::
into
our
bar
while
protesting protest%2:32:00::
that
they
can
only
dunk dunk%2:35:00::
and
run run%2:38:00::
.
(
Sanity
,
solvency
and
relations
with
our
wine_merchant
took take%2:31:09::
a
beating
that
first
summer
as
we
inadvertently
became become%2:42:01::
the
neighborhood
free-drink
stop
.
)
We
designated designate%2:32:00::
one_day
a
week
as
the
time
when
neighborhood
teen-agers
might
swim swim%2:38:00::
at
definite
hours
.
This
has
saved save%2:41:01::
us
from
constant
requests
seven
days
a
week
and
made make%2:30:00::
us
feel feel%2:37:00::
less
brutal
to
the
young
``
less
fortunate
''
than
ours
.
We
also
worked_out work_out%2:30:00::
logistics
for
Sunday
afternoon
swimmers
who
arrive arrive%2:38:00::
two
hours
early
with
their
weekend
guests
while
we
are
still
enjoying enjoy%2:37:00::
an
alfresco
lunch
en_famille
.
We
gently
usher usher%2:38:00::
them
to
an
island
of
tables
and
chairs
strategically
placed place%2:35:00::
on_the_far_side
of
the
pool
where
they
can
amuse amuse%2:41:00::
each
other
until
we
get get%2:30:00::
ready
to
merge merge%2:30:00::
sides
.
All
dressing
(
undressing
to
be be%2:42:03::
more
exact
)
must
be
done do%2:41:04::
in
our
small
bath
house
or
at
the
swimmers
'
homes
.
(
To
avoid avoid%2:41:01::
any
possible
excuse
for
a
dripping
parade
through
your
house
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
a
good
idea
to
have have%2:40:00::
a
telephone_extension
near
the
pool
as_well
as
a
direct
outdoor
route
between
the
pool
and
the
parking_area
.
)
We
do
,
however
,
provide provide%2:40:00::
a
limited
number
of
extra
suits
,
mainly
for
children
,
and
we
stock stock%2:40:00::
extra
towels
and
a_few
inexpensive
bathing
conveniences
.
Life-preservers
,
the
buckle-on
kapok-filled
kind
,
are
held hold%2:42:00::
in
readiness
,
too
,
for
the
very
young
.
Safety
rules
,
of_course
,
are be%2:42:03::
more
important
than
all
the
others
put_together put_together%2:36:00::
.
In
many
localities
,
now
,
the
law
requires require%2:32:00::
all
pools
to
be
fenced fence%2:35:00::
,
usually
to
a
minimum
height
of
5
feet
.
But
fenced
or
unfenced
,
no
pool-side
is be%2:42:06::
the
place
for
running
or
horseplay
.
We
allow allow%2:32:00::
no
underwater
endurance_contests
,
either
,
or
inexpert
versions
of
water_polo
.
Diving_boards
must
have have%2:42:00::
non-skid
surfaces
(
coco
matting
takes take%2:31:09::
an
awful
beating
from
chlorine
and
rots rot%2:30:00::
quickly
,
but
grit-impregnated
paints
are be%2:42:03::
excellent
)
.
And
divers
must
be
enjoined enjoin%2:32:00::
to
look look%2:39:00::
before
they
leap leap%2:38:00::
,
either
on
top
of
someone
else
or
onto
a
pool
edge

Our
pools
also
have have%2:42:00::
wide
,
shallow
steps
-
for
the
benefit
of
the
littlest
swimmers
who
can
thus
be
introduced introduce%2:32:00::
to
the
water
with
far
greater
safety
than
a
ladder
affords afford%2:40:00::
.
All
bottles
must
be
kept keep%2:42:00::
a
safe
distance
away
from
the
pool
and
drinking_glasses
are
banned ban%2:32:00::
in
favor
of
plastic
or
metal
cups
.
When
you
first
acquire acquire%2:40:00::
a
pool
,
we
earnestly
recommend recommend%2:32:01::
-
for
your
own
mental_health
-
a
good
long
chat
with
your
insurance_agent
.
You
should
be be%2:42:03::
prepared
to
cope_with cope_with%2:41:00::
any
pitfall
such_as
plunges
into
empty
pools
or
shallow
ends
and
all
manner
of
winter
as_well
as
summer
lawsuits
.
Soignee
pools
,
alas
,
do
not
just
happen happen%2:41:00::
.
They
are be%2:42:03::
the
result
of
a
constant
and
careful
contest
with
the
elements

Unless
you
want_to
make make%2:30:00::
your

and
vacuuming vacuum%2:35:00::
-
is
best
left leave%2:40:06::
to
a

for
teen-agers

Even_so

every
pool
owner

in_case

emergency

should
have have%2:40:04::
some
idea
of_what

A
brief
course
in

pool

do do%2:36:01::
some
