Men
need need%2:34:00::
unity
and
they
need need%2:34:00::
God
.
Care
must
be
taken take_care%2:41:00::
neither
to
confuse confuse%2:31:02::
unity
with
uniformity
nor
God
with
our
parochial
ideas
about
him
,
but
with
these
two
qualifications
,
the
statement
stands stand%2:42:02::
.
The
statement
also
points point%2:32:00::
to
a
classic
paradox
:
The
more
men
turn turn%2:38:00::
toward
God
,
who
is be%2:42:06::
not_only
in
himself
the
paradigm
of
all
unity
but
also
the
only
ground
on_which
human
unity
can
ultimately
be
established establish%2:41:00::
,
the
more
men
splinter splinter%2:41:00::
into
groups
and
set set%2:35:00::
themselves
apart
from
one
another
.
To
be
reminded remind%2:31:00::
of_this
we
need
only
glance glance%2:39:00::
at
the
world
map
and
note note%2:39:02::
the
extent
to_which
religious
divisions
have
compounded compound%2:30:01::
political
ones
,
with
a
resultant
fragmentation
of
the
human_race
.
Massacres
attending attend%2:42:00::
the
partition
of
India
and
the
establishment
of
the
State
of
Israel
are be%2:42:06::
simply
recent
grim
evidences
of
the
hostility
such
divisions
can
engender engender%2:36:00::
.
The
words
of
Cardinal_Newman
come come_to_mind%2:31:00::
forcibly
to
mind
:
``
Oh
how
we
hate hate%2:37:00::
one
another
for
the
love
of
God
''
!
The
source
of_this
paradox
is be%2:42:03::
not
difficult
to
identify identify%2:31:00::
.
It
lies_in lie_in%2:42:00::
institutions
.
Institutions
require require%2:42:00::
structure
,
form
,
and
definition
,
and
these
in_turn
entail entail%2:42:01::
differentiation
and
exclusion
.
A
completely
amorphous
institution
would
be be%2:42:06::
a
contradiction_in_terms
;
to
escape escape%2:32:04::
this
fate
,
it
must
rule rule_out%2:42:00::
some
things
out
.
For
every
criterion
which
defines define%2:42:00::
what
something
is be%2:42:06::
,
at_the_same_time
proclaims proclaim%2:32:02::
-
implicitly
if_not
openly
-
what
that
something
is be%2:42:06::
not
.
Some
persons
are be%2:42:03::
so
sensitive
to
this
truth
as
to
propose propose%2:31:00::
that
we
do_away_with
institutions
altogether
;
in
the
present
context
this
amounts amount%2:42:03::
to
the
advice
that
while
being be%2:42:03::
religious
may
have have%2:40:00::
a
certain
justification
,
we
ought ought%2:42:01::
to
dispense_with dispense_with%2:40:01::
churches
.
The
suggestion
is be%2:42:03::
naive
.
Man
is be%2:42:06::
at_once
a
gregarious
animal
and
a
form-creating
being
.
Having
once
committed commit%2:32:01::
himself
to
an
ideal
which
he
considers consider%2:31:00::
worthwhile
,
he
inevitably
creates create%2:36:00::
forms
for
its
expression
and
institutions
for
its
continuance
.
To
propose propose%2:32:00::
that
men
be be%2:42:03::
religious
without
having have%2:40:00::
religious
institutions
is be%2:42:06::
like
proposing propose%2:32:00::
that
they
be be%2:42:03::
learned
without
having have%2:40:00::
schools
.
Both
eventualities
are be%2:42:03::
possible
logically
,
but
practically
they
are be%2:42:03::
impossible
.
As
much_as
men
intrinsically
need need%2:34:00::
the
unity
that_is
grounded ground%2:35:08::
in
God
,
they
instrumentally
require require%2:42:00::
the
institutions
that
will
direct direct%2:38:00::
their
steps
toward
him
.
Yet
the
fact
remains remain%2:30:00::
that
such
institutions
do
set set%2:30:01::
men
at_odds
with
their
fellows
.
Is be%2:42:00::
there
any
way_out
of
the
predicament
?
The
only
way
that
I
can
see see%2:36:00::
is be%2:42:06::
through
communication
.
Interfaith
communication
need
not
be
regarded_as regard_as%2:31:00::
an
unfortunate
burden
visited visit%2:32:01::
upon
us
by
the
necessity
of
maintaining maintain%2:40:00::
diplomatic
relations
with
our
adversaries
.
Approached approach%2:41:00::
creatively
,
it
is be%2:42:06::
a
high
art
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
the
art
of
relating relate%2:31:00::
the
finite
to
the
infinite
,
of
doing do%2:41:01::
our
best
to
insure insure%2:31:00::
that
the
particularistic
requirements
of
religious
institutions
will
not
thwart thwart%2:41:00::
God
's
intent
of
unity
among
men
more_than
is be%2:42:03::
minimally
necessary
.
In
a
certain
sense
,
interfaith
communication
parallels parallel%2:42:00::
diplomatic
communication
among
the
nation-states
.
What
are
the
pertinent
facts
affecting affect%2:30:00::
such
communication
at
the
present
juncture
of
history
?
I
shall
touch_on touch_on%2:32:01::
three
areas
:
personal
,
national
,
and
theological
.
By
personal
factors
I
mean mean%2:31:01::
those
rooted
in
personality
structure
.
Some
interfaith
tensions
are
not
occasioned occasion%2:36:00::
by
theological
differences
at_all
,
but
by
the
need
of
men
to
have have%2:40:00::
persons
they
can
blame blame%2:32:01::
,
distrust distrust%2:31:00::
,
denounce denounce%2:32:00::
,
and
even
hate hate%2:37:00::
.
Such
needs
may
rise rise%2:30:02::
to
pathological
proportions
.
Modern
psychology
has
shown show%2:32:00::
that
paralleling parallel%2:42:00::
``
the
authoritarian
personality
''
is
``
the
bigoted
personality
''
in_which
insecurity
,
inferiority
,
suspicion
,
and
distrust
combine combine%2:30:00::
to
provide provide%2:40:00::
a
target
for
antagonism
so
indispensable
that
it
will
be
manufactured manufacture%2:36:00::
if
it
does
not
exist exist%2:42:00::
naturally
.
Fortunately
the
number
of
pathological
bigots
appears appear%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
quite
small
,
but
it
would
be be%2:42:06::
a
mistake
to
think think%2:31:03::
that
more_than
a
matter
of
degree
separates separate%2:31:01::
them
from
the
rest
of
us
.
To_some_extent
the
personal
inadequacies
that
prejudices
attempt attempt%2:41:00::
to
compensate compensate%2:42:00::
for
are be%2:42:03::
to
be
found find%2:39:02::
in_all
of
us
.
Interfaith
conflicts
which
spring spring%2:42:00::
from
psychological
deficiencies
are be%2:42:03::
the_most
unfortunate
of
all
,
for
they
have have%2:40:00::
no
redeeming
features
whatsoever
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
difficult
to
say say%2:32:00::
what
can
be
done do%2:41:01::
about
them
except
that
we
must
learn learn%2:31:00::
to
recognize recognize%2:31:01::
when
it
is be%2:42:06::
they
,
rather_than
pretexts
for
them
,
that
are
causing cause%2:36:00::
the
trouble
,
and
do do%2:41:01::
everything
possible
to
nurture nurture%2:32:00::
the
healthy
personalities
that
will
prevent prevent%2:41:01::
the
development
of
such
deficiencies
.
While
the
personality
factors
that
aggravate aggravate%2:30:00::
interfaith
conflict
may
be be%2:42:03::
perennial
,
nationalism
is be%2:42:03::
more
variable
.
The
specific
instance
I
have_in_mind have_in_mind%2:31:01::
is be%2:42:06::
the
Afro-Asian
version
which
has
gained gain%2:40:03::
prominence
only
in_this
second_half
of
the
twentieth
century
.
Emerging emerge%2:30:02::
from
the
two
centuries
of
colonial
domination
,
the
Afro-Asian
world
is be%2:42:03::
aflame
with
a
nationalism
that
has
undone undo%2:35:00::
empires
.
No_less_than
twenty-two
nations
have
already
achieved achieve%2:41:00::
independence
since
World_War
2
,
,
and
the
number
is
growing grow%2:30:00::
by
the
year
.
As
an
obvious
consequence
,
obstacles
to
genuine
interfaith
communication
have
grown grow%2:30:03::
more
formidable
in
one
important
area
:
relations
between
Christians
and
non-Christians
in
these
lands
.
Colonialism
alone
would
have
been be%2:42:03::
able_to
make make%2:30:00::
these
difficulties
serious
,
for
Christianity
is be%2:42:03::
so
closely
tied tie%2:30:01::
to
colonialism
in
the
minds
of
these
people
that
repudiation
of
the
one
has
tended tend%2:42:01::
automatically
toward
the
repudiation
of
the
other
.
Actually
,
however
,
this
turns_out turn_out%2:42:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
only
part
of
the
picture
.
Nationalism
has
abetted abet%2:41:00::
not_only
the
repudiation
of
foreign
religions
but
the
revival
of
native
ones
,
some
of_which
had
been_lying
in
slumber
for
centuries
.
The
truth
is be%2:42:06::
that
any
revival
of
traditional
and
indigenous
religion
will
serve serve%2:42:01::
to
promote promote%2:41:01::
that
sense
of
identity
and
Volksgeist
which
these
young
nations
very_much
need need%2:34:00::
.
Insofar
as
these
nations
claim claim%2:32:00::
to
incarnate incarnate%2:36:00::
traditions
and
ways_of_life
which
constitute constitute%2:42:00::
ultimate
,
trans-political
justifications
for
their
existence
,
such
people
are
inevitably
led lead%2:32:00::
to
emphasize emphasize%2:32:00::
the
ways
in_which
these
traditions
and
ways
are be%2:42:03::
theirs
rather_than
someone
else
's
.
All
this
works work%2:35:02::
severely
against
the
kind_of
cross-cultural
communication
for
which
Christian
missions
stand stand%2:42:00::
.
Africans
and
Asians
tend tend%2:42:01::
to
consider consider%2:31:00::
not_only
missions
but
the
local
churches
they
have
produced produce%2:36:03::
as
centers
and
agents
of
Western
culture
and
ideology
if_not
of
direct
political
propaganda
.
The
people
hardest
hit hit%2:35:05::
by
this
suspicion
are be%2:42:06::
,
of_course
,
Christians
on
the
mainland
of
China
.
But
the
problem
extends extend%2:42:01::
elsewhere
.
For_example
,
in
Burma
and
Ceylon
many
Buddhists
argue argue%2:32:02::
that
Buddhism
ought ought%2:42:01::
to
be be%2:42:06::
the
official
state
religion
.
In
1960
Ceylon
nationalized nationalize%2:30:00::
its
sectarian
-
preponderantly
Christian
-
schools
,
to
the
rejoicing
of
most_of
its
7000000
Buddhists
and
the
lament
of
its
800000
Roman_Catholics
.
Again
,
India
has
imposed impose%2:41:00::
formidable
barriers
against
the
entrance
of
additional
missionaries
,
and
fanatical
Hindu
parties
are
expected expect%2:31:00::
to
seek seek%2:40:00::
further
action
against
Christians
once
the
influence
making_for make_for%2:36:00::
tolerance
due_to
Nehru
and
his
followers
is be%2:42:03::
gone
.
The
progressive
closing
of
Afro-Asian
ears
to
the
Christian
message
is
epitomized epitomize%2:42:00::
in
a
conversation
I
had
three
years
ago
while
flying fly%2:38:00::
from
Jerusalem
to
Cairo
.
I
was be%2:42:03::
seated
next
to
the
director
of
the
Seventh_Day_Adventists
'
world
radio
program
.
He
said say%2:32:01::
that
on
his
tour
the
preceding
year
a
considerable
number
of
hours
would
have
been be%2:42:03::
available
to
him
on
Japanese
radio
networks
,
but
that
he
had
then
lacked lack%2:42:00::
the
funds
to
contract contract%2:32:00::
for
them
.
After
returning return%2:38:00::
to
the
United_States
and
raising raise%2:40:00::
the
money
,
he
discovered discover%2:31:00::
on
getting_back get_back%2:38:00::
to
Japan
that
the
hours
were be%2:42:03::
no_longer
available
.
It
was
not
that
they
had
been
contracted contract%2:32:00::
for
during
the
interval
;
they
simply
could
no_longer
be
purchased purchase%2:40:00::
for
missionary
purposes
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
not
unfair
to
add add%2:32:01::
on
the
other
side
that
the
crude
and
almost
vitriolic
approach
of
certain
fundamentalist
sects
toward
the
cultures
and
religions
among
which
they
work work%2:41:02::
has
contributed contribute%2:40:01::
measurably
to
this
heightening
of
anti-Christian
sentiment
.
Ironically
,
these
are be%2:42:06::
the
groups
which
have
doubled double%2:30:00::
or
tripled triple%2:30:00::
their
missionary
efforts
since
World_War
2
,
,
while
the
more
established
denominations
are
barely
maintaining maintain%2:34:00::
pre-war
staffs
.
Although
I
have
emphasized emphasize%2:32:00::
the
barriers
which
an
aroused
nationalism
has
raised raise%2:36:02::
against
relations
between
Christians
and
non-Christians
in
Asia
,
the
fact
is be%2:42:06::
that
this
development
has
also
widened widen%2:30:00::
the
gulf
between
certain
Afro-Asian
religions
themselves
.
The
partition
of
India
has
hardly
improved improve%2:30:01::
relations
between
Hindus
and
Muslims
;
neither
has
the
establishment
of
the
State
of
Israel
fostered foster%2:41:00::
harmony
between
Muslims
and
Jews
.
I
turn turn%2:38:00::
finally
to
several
theological
developments
.
Theocracy
reconsidered reconsider%2:31:00::
.
The
modern_world
has
been
marked mark%2:31:09::
by
progressive
disaffection
with
claims
to
divine
sanction
for
the
state
,
whatever
its
political
form
.
The
American_Constitution
was be%2:42:03::
historic
at
this
point
in
providing provide%2:32:00::
that
``
Congress
shall
make make%2:41:00::
no
law
respecting respect%2:31:00::
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting prohibit%2:32:00::
the
free
exercise
thereof
''
.
One
of
our
foremost
jurists
,
David_Dudley_Field
,
has
gone
so_far
as
to
call call%2:32:00::
this
provision
``
the
greatest
achievement
ever
made make%2:41:00::
in
the
course
of
human
history
''
.
The
trend
throughout_the_world
's
religions
has
been be%2:42:03::
toward
a
recognition
of
at_least
the
practical
validity
of_this
constitutional
enactment
.
Pakistan
was
created create%2:36:00::
in
1947
expressly
as
a
Muslim
state
,
but
when
the
army
took_over take_over%2:40:07::
eleven
years
later
it
did
so
on
a
wave
of
mass
impatience
which
was
directed direct%2:33:01::
in_part
against
the
inability
of
political
and
religious_leaders
to
think think%2:31:00::
their
way
through
to
the
meaning
of
Islam
for
the
modern
political
situation
.
``
What
is
the
point
''
,
Charles_Adams
reports report%2:32:00::
the
Pakistanis
as
asking ask%2:32:00::
,
``
in
demanding demand%2:42:00::
an
Islamic
state
and
society
if
no
one
,
not
even
the
doctors
of
the
sacred
law
themselves
,
can
say say%2:32:00::
clearly
and
succinctly
what
the
nature
of
such
a
state
and
society
is be%2:42:06::
''
?
The
current
regime
of
President_Mohammad_Ayub_Khan
is be%2:42:03::
determinedly
secular
.
And
while
the
nation
was
formerly
named name%2:32:03::
``
The
Islamic_Republic
of
Pakistan
''
,
it
is
now
simply
``
The
Republic
of
Pakistan
''
.
Comparable
trends
can
be
noted note%2:39:02::
elsewhere
.
The
new
regime
in
Turkey
is be%2:42:03::
intentionally
less
Muslim
than
its
predecessor
.
The
religious
parties
in
Israel
have
experienced experience%2:39:01::
a
great
loss
of
prestige
in
recent
months
.
During
the
years
when
Israel
was
passing pass%2:38:00::
from
crisis
to
crisis
-
the
Sinai
campaign
,
the
infusion
of
multitudes
of
penniless
immigrants
-
it
was
felt feel%2:31:00::
that
the
purpose
of
national
unity
could
be
best
served serve%2:42:03::
if
the
secular
majority
were
to
yield yield%2:40:01::
to
the
religious
parties
.
Now
that
Israel
enjoys enjoy%2:39:00::
relative
prosperity
and
a
reduction
of
tensions
,
the
secularists
are be%2:42:03::
less
disposed
to
compromise compromise%2:32:00::
.
And
in_this
country
Gustave_Weigel
's
delineation
of
the
line
between
the
sacral
and
secular
orders
during
the
last
presidential
campaign
served serve%2:42:01::
to
provide provide%2:40:00::
a
most
impressive
Roman_Catholic
defense
of
the
practical
autonomy
of
both
church
and
state
.
The
failure
at_that_time
of
the
Puerto
Rican
bishops
to
control control%2:37:06::
the
votes
of
their
people
added add%2:40:00::
a
ring
of
good_sense
to
Father_Weigel
's
theological
argument
.
Everywhere
there
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:00::
a
growing
recognition
of
the
fact
that
governments
and
religious
