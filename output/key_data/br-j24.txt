Follow-up
visits
of
the
nurse
and
social_worker
indicated indicate%2:32:03::
continued
success
in

care
of
the
new
babies

as
a
marked
improvement
in
the
family
's
day-to-day
mental_health
and
social
functioning
.
As
seen see%2:39:02::
in
the
B.
family
,
there
must
be be%2:42:04::
an
attempt
to
help help%2:41:00::
the
client
develop develop%2:30:06::
conscious
awareness
of
the
problem
,
especially
in
the
absence
of
a
formal
request
for
assistance
.
The
lack
of
awareness
usually
springs spring%2:42:00::
from
deep
but
disguised
anxiety
,
often
assuming assume%2:30:00::
the
superficial
guise
of
``
not
knowing know%2:31:01::
''
or
``
not
caring care%2:37:02::
''
.
The
unhealthy
use
of
denial
in
the
initial
reaction
to
a
stress
must
be
handled handle%2:41:03::
through
the
medium
of
a
positive
controlled
transference
.
In_general
,
the
approach
is be%2:42:03::
more
active
than
passive
,
more
out-reaching
than
reflective
.
While
some
regression
is be%2:42:03::
inevitable
,
it
is
discouraged discourage%2:32:01::
rather_than
encouraged encourage%2:41:00::
so_that
the
transference
does
not
follow follow%2:30:00::
the
stages
of
planned
regression
associated
with
certain
casework
adaptations
of
the
psychoanalytic
model
for
insight
therapy
.
To
establish establish%2:41:00::
an
emotionally
meaningful
relationship
the
worker
must
demonstrate demonstrate%2:39:01::
actual
or
potential
helpfulness
immediately
,
preferably
within
the
first
interview
,
by
meeting meet%2:34:00::
the
client
's
specific
needs
.
These
needs
usually
concern concern%2:42:00::
the
reduction
of
guilt
and
some
relief
of
tension
.
The
initial
interview
must
be be%2:42:03::
therapeutic
rather_than
purely
exploratory
in
an
information-seekingsense
.
In_this
relationship-building
stage
the
worker
must
communicate communicate%2:32:01::
confidence
in
the
client
's
ability
to
deal deal%2:41:13::
with
the
problem
.
In
so
doing
he
implicitly
offers offer%2:40:02::
the
positive
contagion
of
hope
as
a
kind_of
maturational
dynamic
to
counteract counteract%2:41:03::
feelings
of
helplessness
and
hopelessness
generally
associated
with
the
first
stages
of
stress
impact
.
Thus
,
the
client
receives receive%2:30:01::
enough
ego
support
to
engage engage%2:41:06::
in
constructive
efforts
on_his_own
behalf
.
Here
there
is
a
specific
preventive
component
which
applies apply%2:42:00::
in
a
more
generalized
sense
to
any
casework
situation
.
We
are
preventing prevent%2:41:01::
or
averting avert%2:41:00::
pathogenic
phenomena
such_as
undue
regression
,
unhealthy
suppression
and
repression
,
excessive
use
of
denial
,
and
crippling
guilt
turned turn%2:30:04::
against
the
self
.
While
some
suppression
and
some
denial
are be%2:42:03::
not_only
necessary
but
healthy
,
the
worker
's
clinical
knowledge
must
determine determine%2:31:01::
how
these
defenses
are
being
used use%2:34:01::
,
what
healthy
shifts
in
defensive
adaptation
are
indicated indicate%2:32:04::
,
and
when
efforts
at
bringing_about bring_about%2:36:00::
change
can
be
most
effectively
timed time%2:31:00::
.
In
steering steer%2:38:01::
the
family
toward
ego-adaptive
and
away
from
maladaptive
responses
,
the
worker
uses use%2:34:01::
time-honored
focused
casework
techniques
of
specific
emotional
support
,
clarification
,
and
anticipatory
guidance
.
Over
a
relatively
short
period_of_time
,
usually
about
four
to
twelve
weeks
,
the
worker
must
be be%2:42:03::
able
to
shift shift%2:30:00::
the
focus
,
back_and_forth
,
between
immediate
external
stressful
exigencies
(
``
precipitating
stress
''
)
and
the
key
,
emotionally
relevant
issues
(
``
underlying
problem
''
)
which
are
,
often
in
a
dramatic
preconscious
breakthrough
,
reactivated reactivate%2:30:00::
by
the
crisis
situation
,
and
hence
once_again
amenable
to
resolution
.
Though
there
is be%2:42:03::
obviously
nothing
new
about
these
techniques
,
they
do
challenge challenge%2:32:00::
the
worker
's
skill
to
articulate articulate%2:32:02::
them
precisely
on_the_spot
and
on
the
basis
of
quick
and
accurate
diagnostic
assessments
.
Then
,
too
,
the
utmost
clinical
flexibility
is be%2:42:03::
necessary
in
judiciously
combining combine%2:42:00::
carefully
timed
family-oriented
home
visits
,
single
and
group
office
interviews
,
and
appropriate
telephone
follow-up
calls
,
if
the
worker
is
to
be be%2:42:03::
genuinely
accessible
and
if
the
predicted
unhealthy
outcome
is
to
be
actually
averted avert%2:41:00::
in_accordance_with
the
principles
of
preventive
intervention
.
In_addition
,
in
many
cases
,
a
variety
of
concrete
social
resources
-
homemaker
,
day_care
,
medical
and
financial_aid
-
must
be be%2:42:03::
reasonably
available
for
the
reality
support
needed
to
bolster bolster%2:30:01::
the
family
in
its
individual
and
collective
coping
and
integrative
efforts
.
At
certain
critical
stages
,
and
only
for
sound
diagnostic
reasons
,
it
may
be be%2:42:03::
important
to
accompany accompany%2:38:00::
family
members
in
their
use
of
these
resources
if
their
problem-solving
behavior
is
to
be be%2:42:03::
constructive
rather_than
defeating
.
While
expensive
in_time
and
involving involve%2:42:07::
a
great_deal
of
adaptation
on
the
part
of
the
worker
(
in_terms_of
his
willingness
to
leave leave%2:31:05::
the
sanctity
of
his
office
and
enter enter%2:38:00::
actively
into
the
client
's
life
)
,
techniques
of
accompaniment
were
found find%2:32:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
of
tremendous
value
when
in
the
service
of
specific
preventive
objectives
.
Finally
,
whatever
the
techniques
used use%2:34:01::
,
a
twin
goal
is be%2:42:03::
common
to
all
preventive
casework
service
:
to
cushion cushion%2:35:00::
or
reduce reduce%2:30:00::
the
force
of
the
stress
impact
while
at_the_same_time
to
encourage encourage%2:41:00::
and
support support%2:41:00::
family
members
to
mobilize mobilize%2:30:02::
and
use use%2:34:01::
their
ego
capacities
.
Having
outlined outline%2:32:00::
an
approach
to
the
theory
and
practice
of
preventive
casework
,
we
now
address address%2:32:00::
ourselves
to
our
final
question
:
What
place
should
brief
,
crisis-oriented
preventive
casework
occupy occupy%2:42:01::
in
our
total
spectrum
of
services
?
We
should
first
recognize recognize%2:31:01::
our
tendency
to
develop develop%2:36:00::
a
hierarchy
of
values
,
locating locate%2:40:01::
brief
treatment
at
the
bottom
and
long-term
intensive
service
at
the
top
,
instead
of
seeing see%2:36:00::
the
services
as
part
of
a
continuum
,
each
important
in
its
own
right
.
This
problem
is be%2:42:03::
perhaps
as
old
as
social
casework
itself
.
Almost
three
decades
ago
Bertha_Reynolds
undertook undertake%2:36:00::
a
study
of
short-contact
interviewing
because
of
her
conviction
that
short-term
casework
had have%2:40:00::
an
important
but
neglected
place
in
our
network
of
social_services
.
Her
conclusion
has
been
borne_out bear_out%2:42:00::
in
the
experience
of
many
practitioners
:
``
short-contact
interviewing
is be%2:42:03::
neither
a
truncated
nor
a
telescoped
experience
but
is be%2:42:03::
of
the
same
essential
quality
as
the
so-called
intensive
case
work
''
.
Thus
,
casework
involving involve%2:42:07::
a
limited
number
of
interviews
is
still
to
be
regarded regard%2:31:00::
in_terms_of
the
quality
of
service
rendered render%2:36:00::
rather_than
of
the
quantity
of
time
expended expend%2:34:00::
.
That
we
are
experiencing experience%2:39:01::
an
upsurge
of
interest
in
the
many
formulations
and
preventive
adaptations
of
brief
treatment
in
social
casework
is be%2:42:03::
evident
from
even
a
small
sampling
of
current
literature
.
Especially
noteworthy
is be%2:42:03::
Levinger
's
finding
that
the
length
of
treatment
per_se
is be%2:42:03::
not
a
reliable
indicator
of
successful
outcome
.
According
to
a_number_of
studies
,
the
important
predictors
are be%2:42:06::
the
nature
and
management
of
the
client
's
anxiety
as_well
as
the
accessibility
of
the
helping
person
.
For_example
,
the
level
of
improvement
noted note%2:32:00::
in
a
recent
experiment
with
a
short
course
of
immediate
treatment
for
parent-child
relationship
problems
compared compare%2:42:00::
favorably
with
the
results
reported report%2:32:00::
by
typical
child
guidance
clinics
where
the
hours
spent spend%2:42:00::
in
purely
diagnostic
study
may
equal equal%2:42:00::
or
exceed exceed%2:42:01::
the
number
of
hours
devoted devote%2:32:00::
to
actual
treatment
interviews
in
the
experimental
project
.
Of
startling
significance
,
too
,
is be%2:42:03::
the
assertion
that
it
was be%2:42:03::
possible
to
carry_out carry_out%2:36:00::
this
program
with
only
a
6
percent
attrition_rate
as
compared compare%2:31:00::
with
a
rate
of
59
percent
reported report%2:32:00::
for
a
comparable
group
of
families
who
were
receiving receive%2:39:03::
help
in
traditionally
operated
child
guidance
services
.
These
reports
refer refer%2:42:00::
to
a_level
of
secondary
prevention
in
a
child
guidance
clinic
approached approach%2:32:00::
by
the
customary
route
of
voluntary
referral
by
the
family
or
by
other
professional
people
.
Similarities
to
the
approach
which
I
have
described describe%2:32:01::
are be%2:42:03::
evident
in
the
prompt
establishment
of
a
helping
relationship
,
quick
appraisal
of
key
issues
,
and
the
immediate
mobilization
of
treatment
plans
as
the
essential
dynamics
in
helping help%2:41:00::
to
further further%2:41:01::
the
ego
's
coping cope%2:41:00::
efforts
in
dealing deal%2:41:13::
with
the
interplay
of
inner
and
outer
stresses
.
While
there
are
many
different
possibilities
for
the
timing
of
casework
intervention
,
the
experiments
recently
reported report%2:32:00::
from
a
variety
of
traditional
settings
all
point_up point_up%2:32:00::
the
importance
of
an
immediate
response
to
the
client
's
initial
need
for
help
.
In
some
programs
,
treatment
is
concentrated concentrate%2:31:00::
over
a
short
period_of_time
,
while
in
others
,
after
the
initial
contact
is
established establish%2:36:00::
,
flexible
spacing
of
interviews
has
been
experimentally
used use%2:34:01::
with
apparent
success
.
Willingness
to
take take%2:40:15::
the
risk
of
early
and
direct
interpretation
(
with
the
proviso
that
if
the
interpretation
is be%2:42:03::
too
threatening
,
the
worker
can
withdraw withdraw%2:41:01::
)
is be%2:42:03::
another
prominent
feature
in
these
efforts
.
My
aim
in
mentioning mention%2:32:02::
this
factor
obviously
is
not
to
give give%2:40:05::
license
to
``
wild
therapy
''
but
rather
to
encourage encourage%2:37:00::
us
to
use use%2:34:01::
the
time-honored
clinical
casework
skills
we
already
possess possess%2:40:00::
,
and
to
use use%2:34:01::
them
with
greater
confidence
,
precision
,
and
professional
pride
.
Though
there
is be%2:42:03::
obviously
great
need
for
continued
experimentation
with
various
types
of
short-term
intervention
to
further further%2:41:01::
efforts
in
developing develop%2:36:00::
an
operational
definition
of
prevention
at
the
secondary
-
or
perhaps
,
in
some
instances
,
primary
-
level
,
the
place
of
short-term
intervention
has
already
been
documented document%2:32:00::
by
a_number_of
investigators
in
a
wide
variety
of
settings
.
Woodward
,
for_example
,
has
emphasized emphasize%2:32:00::
the
``
need
for
a
broad
spectrum
of
services
,
including include%2:42:00::
very
brief
services
in
connection
with
critical
situations
''
.
Ideally
,
brief
treatment
should
be
arrived_at arrive_at%2:38:00::
as
a
treatment
of
choice
rather_than
as
a
treatment
of
chance
.
Moreover
,
the
shortage
of
treatment
resources
and
the
chronically
persistent
shortage
of
mental_health
manpower
force force%2:41:00::
us
to
innovate innovate%2:36:00::
additional
refinements
of
preventive
intervention
techniques
to
make make%2:30:00::
services
more
widely
available
-
and
on
a
more
effective
basis
to
more
people
.
Further

the
meaning
of

and
the
