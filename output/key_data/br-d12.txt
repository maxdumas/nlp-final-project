sought seek%2:35:00::
some
answers
to
these
questions

Several
New_England
realtors
were
invited invite%2:32:01::
to

in
a
small
colloquium
of
property
lawyers

the
question
of

and
the
part
each
man
present
played play%2:41:12::
in
it
.
For
a_number_of
years
,
Wesleyan
has
been
drawing draw%2:37:03::
varied
groups
of
political
and
business_leaders
into
these
informal
discussions
with
members
of
the
faculty
and
student
body
,
attempting attempt%2:41:00::
to
explore explore%2:31:00::
and
clarify clarify%2:30:00::
aspects
of
their
responsibility
for
public
policy
.
This
article
presents present%2:39:00::
our
observations
of_that
session
,
of
the
realtors
as
they
saw see%2:31:00::
themselves
and
as
the
faculty
and
students
saw see%2:31:00::
them
.
Such
conversation
quickly
reveals reveal%2:39:00::
an
ethically
significant
ambivalence
in
the
self-images
held hold%2:37:00::
by
most
realtors
.
Within
the
membership
of_this
group
,
as
has
been
found find%2:39:02::
true
of
men
in
other
professional
or
trade
associations
,
the_most
ready
portrayal
of
oneself
to
``
the
public
''
is be%2:42:03::
that
of
a
neutral
agent
simply
serving serve%2:41:02::
the
interests
of
a
seller
or
buyer
and
mediating mediate%2:32:00::
between
them
.
Professional
responsibility
is
seen see%2:39:02::
to
consist consist%2:42:00::
largely
in
serving serve%2:41:02::
the
wishes
of
the
client
fairly
and
in
an
efficient
manner
.
But
as
conversation
goes_on go_on%2:42:00::
,
particularly
among
the
realtors
themselves
,
another
image
emerges emerge%2:30:01::
,
that
of
considerable
power
and
influence
in
the
community
.
Obviously
,
much
more_than
customer
expectation
is
determining determine%2:31:02::
the
realtor
's
role
.
Judgments
are
continually
rendered render%2:40:02::

potential
buyers

income
,
educational
level
and
above_all
,
racial

them
for
``
congenial
''
,
``
happy
''
relations_to
other
people
in
certain
community
areas
.
How
explicit
such
factors
have
been be%2:42:03::
historically
is be%2:42:03::
evident
in
any
chronology
of
restrictive
covenant
cases
or
in
a
review
of
NAREB
's
Code
of
Ethics
Article
34
in
the
Code
,
adopted adopt%2:40:02::
in
1924
,
states
that
``
a
Realtor

never

Though
the

was

by
the

The
rationale
for
this
avoidance
was
most
frequently
expressed express%2:32:01::
in

all
feared fear%2:37:00::

introduced introduce%2:30:03::
non-white
,
particularly
Negro
,
peoples
into
all-white
,
restricted
areas
.
They
would
become become%2:30:00::
tagged
as
men
not
interested
in
being be%2:42:02::
purely
real_estate
``
professionals
''
but
agitators
for
some
kind_of
``

reform
''
,
and
this
was be%2:42:03::
no_longer
to
be be%2:42:03::
a
``

Obviously
what
we
are
confronted confront%2:32:00::
with
here
is be%2:42:07::
the
identification
of
``
professional
''
with
narrow
skills
and
specialization
,
the
effective
servicing
of
a
client
,
rather_than
responsiveness
to
the
wider
and
deeper
meaning
and
associations
of
one
's
work

These

about
the
public
responses
that
actually
follow follow%2:42:00::
their
occasional
breach
of
a
``
client-service
relationship
''
.
This
narrow
``
professionalism
''
does
not
even
fit fit%2:42:04::
the
present
realities
of
their
situation
,
as
the
pressure
of
minorities
and
the
power
and
respectability
of
the
realtors
increase increase%2:30:00::
.
As
our
discussion
continued continue%2:42:01::
,
the
inadequacy
of
the
``
client
relationship
''
as
an
interpretation
of
their
``
way
of
operating operate%2:41:00::
''
became become%2:30:00::
evident
.
Realtors
live live%2:42:08::
in
their
