You
have
heard hear%2:39:00::
him
tell tell%2:32:04::
these
young
people
that
during
his
almost
50
years
of
service
in
the
Congress
he
has
seen see%2:39:02::
the
Kaisers
and
the
Hitlers
and
the
Mussolinis
,
the
Tojos
and
Stalins
and
Khrushchevs
,
come come%2:38:04::
and
go go%2:38:01::
and
that
we
are
passing_on pass_on%2:40:00::
to
them
the
freest
Nation
that
mankind
has
ever
known know%2:31:04::
.
Then
I
have
seen see%2:39:00::
the
pride
of
country
well well%2:38:00::
in
the
eyes
of
these
young
people
.
So
,
I
say say%2:32:00::
,
Mr._Speaker
,
God
bless bless%2:32:00::
you
and
keep keep%2:42:02::
you
for
many
years
not_only
for
this
body
but
for
the
United_States_of_America
and
the
free_world
.
You
remember remember%2:31:00::
the
words
of
President_Kennedy
a
week
or_so
ago
,
when
someone
asked ask%2:32:00::
him
when
he
was be%2:42:04::
in
Canada
,
and
Dean_Rusk
was be%2:42:04::
in
Europe
,
and
Vice_President
Johnson
was be%2:42:04::
in
Asia
,
``
Who
is_running
the
store
''
?
and
he
said say%2:32:00::
``
The
Same
fellow
who
has
been_running
it
,
Sam_Rayburn
''
.
Mr._Speaker
,
I
ask ask%2:32:01::
unanimous
consent
that
all
Members
who
desire desire%2:37:00::
to
do do%2:41:01::
so
may
extend extend%2:40:04::
their
remarks
at
this
point
in
the
Record
;
and
also
that
they
may
have have%2:40:00::
5
legislative
days
in_which
to
extend extend%2:40:04::
their
remarks
.
Is
there
objection
to
the
request
of
the
gentleman
from
Massachusetts
?
There
was be%2:42:04::
no
objection
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
notably
significant
that
so
many
Members
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
express express%2:32:00::
their
respect
and
admiration
for
our
beloved
Speaker
,
the
Honorable_Sam_Rayburn
.
I
purposely
refrained_from refrain_from%2:41:00::
adding add%2:32:01::
the
usual
distinction
of
saying say%2:32:00::
that
he
was be%2:42:03::
from
the
State
of
Texas
.
I
did
so
because
I
agree agree%2:32:00::
with
so
many
here
today
,
that
he
is be%2:42:06::
the
beloved
Speaker
of
all
the
people
of
the
United_States
.
For
the
dignity
,
the
influence
,
and
the
power
of
the
legislative
branch
of
our
Government
-
it
is be%2:42:06::
a
privilege
for
us
to
do do%2:29:09::
honor
to
this
great
man
who
represents represent%2:41:00::
not
alone
his
own
district
but
all
the
people
of
our
country
.
To
honor honor%2:41:00::
him
is be%2:42:06::
to
honor honor%2:41:00::
ourselves
.
In_this
my
first
year
as
a
Member
of_this
body
I
have
experienced experience%2:39:01::
many
memorable
moments
.
Many_of
these
experiences
are be%2:42:03::
so
important
that
they
will
be
cherished cherish%2:37:00::
forever
by
me
.
And
,
like
many_of
you
here
present
,
I
hold hold%2:37:00::
as
the
highlight
of
all
,
the
occasion
of
my
first
meeting
with
the
honorable
Speaker
of
the
House
.
At_that_time
,
he
afforded afford%2:40:00::
me
the
courtesy
of
his
busy
workday
for
such
length
as
I
may
need need%2:37:00::
,
to
speak speak%2:32:00::
about
my
background
,
my
hopes
,
my
views
on
various
national
and
local
topics
,
and
any
problems
that
I
may
have
been be%2:42:03::
vexed
with
at_the_time
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
fatherly
in
his
handling
of
all
subjects
with
me
and
tremendously
wise
in
his
counsel
.
In_conclusion
,
he
wished wish%2:37:01::
me
well
-
and
as
kindly
and
humbly
as
this
humane
gentleman
could
express express%2:32:00::
himself
,
he
asked ask%2:32:01::
to
be_remembered
to
my
wife
and
children
.
In
my
short
period
here
I
believe believe%2:31:00::
that
at_no_time
has
he
been be%2:42:06::
otherwise
than
the_most
popular
man
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
.
He
is be%2:42:03::
most
effective
in
the
ordinary
business
of
the
House
,
and
in
the
legislative
accomplishments
of_this
session
,
he
easily
rose rise%2:33:00::
to
great
occasion
-
even
at
the
height
of
unpleasantness
and
exciting
legislative
struggle
-
and
as
the
Nation
witnessed witness%2:39:00::
these
contests
,
he
rose rise%2:30:09::
,
even
as
admitted admit%2:32:00::
by
those
who
differed differ%2:42:00::
with
him
,
to
the
proportions
of
a
hero
and
a
noble
partisan
.
I
am be%2:42:03::
highly
privileged
today
to
commemorate commemorate%2:31:00::
the
brilliant
career
of_this
parliamentary
giant
.
He
will
ever
be be%2:42:06::
my
example
as
a
true
statesman
;
one
who
is be%2:42:03::
thoroughly
human
,
who
affects affect%2:32:00::
no
dignity
,
and
who
is be%2:42:03::
endowed_with
real
ability
,
genuine
worth
,
and
sterling
honesty
-
all
dedicated_to
secure secure%2:40:00::
the
best
interests
of
the
country
he
has
loved love%2:37:00::
and
served serve%2:41:02::
so_long
.
May
the
Divine_Speaker
in
Heaven
bless bless%2:32:00::
this
country
with
Sam_Rayburn
's
continued
service
here
for
years
to
come come%2:30:01::
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
a
matter
of
deep
personal
satisfaction
for
me
to
add add%2:30:00::
my
voice
to
the
great
and
distinguished
chorus
of
my
colleagues
in_this
paean
of
praise
,
respect
,
and
affection
for
Speaker_Sam_Rayburn
.
In_this
hour
of
crisis
,
the
wisdom
,
the
dedication
,
the
stabilizing
force
that
he
represents represent%2:32:02::
in
current
American
government
is be%2:42:06::
an
almost
indispensable
source
of
strength
.
He
has
become become%2:30:00::
in_this
half
century
the
grand
old_man
of
American
history
.
It
seems seem%2:39:01::
to
me
that
the
prayers
of
the
whole
free_world
must
rise rise%2:30:09::
like
some
vast
petition
to
Providence
that
Sam_Rayburn
's
vigor
and
his
life
remain remain%2:30:00::
undiminished
through
the
coming
decades
.
Here
briefly
in_this
humble
tribute
I
have
sought seek%2:35:00::
for
some
simple
and
succinct
summation
that
would
define define%2:42:00::
the
immense
service
of_this
patriot
to
his
country
.
But
the
task
is be%2:42:03::
beyond
me
because
I
hold hold%2:31:01::
it
impossible
to
compress compress%2:35:01::
in
a
sentence
or
two
the
complicated
and
prodigious
contributions
Sam_Rayburn
has
made
as
an
individual
,
as
a
legislator
,
as
a
statesman
and
as
a
leader
and
conciliator
,
to
the
majestic
progress
of_this
Nation
.
It
happens happen%2:41:00::
that
I
am be%2:42:06::
a
legislator
from
Ohio
and
that
I
feel feel%2:37:00::
deeply
about
the
needs
,
the
aspirations
,
the
interests
of
my
district
and
my
State
.
What
Sam_Rayburn
's
life
proves prove%2:31:00::
to
us
all
is be%2:42:06::
the
magnificent
lesson
in
political_science
that
one
can
devotedly
and
with
absolute
dedication
represent represent%2:41:00::
the
seemingly
provincial
interests
of
one
's
own
community
,
one
's
own
district
,
one
's
own
State
,
and
by
that
help help%2:41:00::
himself
represent represent%2:41:00::
even
better
the
sweep
and
scope
of
the
problems
of_this
the
greatest
nation
of_all_time
.
For
Sam_Rayburn
never
forgot forget%2:31:01::
Bonham
,
his
home
community
,
and
he
never
forgot forget%2:31:01::
Texas
.
In
the
Same
way
I
like like%2:37:01::
to
think think%2:31:01::
we
owe owe%2:40:01::
our
loyalty
as
legislators
to
our
community
,
our
district
,
our
State
.
And
,
if
we
follow follow%2:30:00::
the
Rayburn
pattern
,
as
consciously
or
by
an
instinctual
political
sense
I
like like%2:37:01::
to
think think%2:31:01::
I
have
followed follow%2:30:00::
it
,
then
the
very
nature
of
our
loyalty
to
our
own
immediate
areas
must
necessarily
be
reflected reflect%2:39:01::
in
the
devotion
of
our
services
to
our
country
.
For
what
Sam_Rayburn
's
life
in_this
House
teaches teach%2:32:00::
us
is be%2:42:06::
that
loyalty
and
character
are be%2:42:03::
not
divisive
and
there
is be%2:42:00::
no
such
thing
as
being be%2:42:03::
for
your
country
and
neglecting neglect%2:31:05::
your
district
.
There
is be%2:42:00::
no
such
thing
as
being be%2:42:03::
diligent
about
national
affairs
but
indifferent
about
home
needs
.
The
two
are be%2:42:03::
as
one
.
This
may
not
be be%2:42:06::
the
greatest
but
it
certainly
comes_close come_close%2:42:00::
to
being be%2:42:06::
the
greatest
lesson
Sam_Rayburn
's
career
,
up_to
this
hour
,
teaches teach%2:32:00::
all_of
us
who
would
aspire aspire%2:31:00::
to
distinction
in
political
life
under
our
processes
of
government
.
More_than
that
,
Sam_Rayburn
is be%2:42:06::
the
very
living
symbol
of
an
iron-clad
integrity
so
powerful
in
his
nature
and
so
constantly
demonstrated demonstrate%2:31:00::
that
he
can
count count%2:31:00::
some
of
his
best
friends
in
the
opposition
.
Through
the_most
rancorous
battles
of
political
controversy
and
the_most
bitterly
fought
national
and
presidential
campaigns
his
character
shines shine%2:42:01::
as
an
example
of
dignity
and
honesty
,
forthrightness
and
nobility
.
Sam_Rayburn
has
never
had have%2:42:05::
to
look_back look_back%2:31:00::
at
any
of
his
most
devastating
fights
and
ever
feel feel%2:37:00::
ashamed
of
his
conduct
as
a
combatant
under_fire
or
his
political
manners
in
the
heat
of
conflicting
ambitions
.
This
means mean%2:42:03::
much
to
the
American
tradition
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
an
answer
in
its
way
,
individual
and
highly
dramatic
,
to
the
charge
that
the
democratic
process
is be%2:42:03::
necessarily
vicious
in
its
campaign
characteristics
.
And
the
name
Rayburn
is be%2:42:06::
one
of
the_most
dominant
in
the
history
of
American
politics
for
the
last
half
century
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
,
I
insist insist%2:32:00::
,
hard
to
define define%2:42:00::
the
Rayburn
contribution
to
our
political
civilization
because
it
is be%2:42:03::
so
massive
and
so
widespread
and
so
complicated
,
and
because
it
goes go_deep%2:42:00::
so
deep
.
But
this
we
know know%2:31:01::
:
Here
is be%2:42:04::
a
great
life
that
in
every
area
of
American
politics
gives give%2:40:05::
the
American
people
occasion
for
pride
and
that
has
invested invest%2:41:03::
the
democratic
process
with
the_most
decent
qualities
of
honor
,
decency
,
and
self-respect
.
I
pray pray%2:32:00::
to
God
that
he
may
be
spared spare%2:41:00::
to
us
for
many
years
to
come come%2:30:01::
for
this
is be%2:42:06::
an
influence
the
United_States
and
the
whole
world
can
ill
afford afford%2:34:00::
to
lose lose%2:40:02::
.
All_but
two
of
my
nine
terms
in
the
House_of_Representatives
has
been
served serve%2:33:00::
under
the
Speakership
of
Sam_Rayburn
.
Of_this
I
am be%2:42:03::
proud
.
I
have have%2:40:00::
a
distinct
admiration
for
this
man
we
honor honor%2:41:00::
today
because
of
the
humility
with
which
he
carries carry%2:41:01::
his
greatness
.
And
Sam_Rayburn
is be%2:42:03::
a
great
man
-
one
who
will
go_down go_down%2:42:00::
in
American
history
as
a
truly
great
leader
of
the
Nation
.
He
will
be
considered consider%2:31:00::
not_only
great
among
his
contemporaries
,
but
as
great
among
all
the
Americans
who
have
played play%2:41:12::
a
part
in
the
country
's
history
since
the
beginning
.
I
pay pay%2:32:00::
my
personal
tribute
to
Sam_Rayburn
,
stalwart
Texan
and
great
American
,
not_only
because
today
he
establishes establish%2:31:02::
a
record
of
having
served serve%2:33:00::
as
Speaker
of
the
House_of_Representatives
more_than
twice_as
long
as
Henry_Clay
,
but
because
of
the
contributions
he
has
made make%2:36:00::
to
the
welfare
of
the
people
of
the
Nation
during
his
almost
half
century
of
service
as
a
Member
of
Congress
.
Speaker_Rayburn
has
not
limited limit%2:30:01::
his
leadership
as
a
statesman
to
his
direction
of
the
House
in
the
Speaker
's
chair
.
He
had have%2:40:00::
an
outstanding
record
as
a
legislator
since
the
start
of
his
career
in
the
House
in
1913
,
the
63
d
Congress
.
No
one
has
sponsored sponsor%2:40:01::
more
progressive
and
important
legislation
than
has
Sam_Rayburn
.
He
is be%2:42:06::
the
recognized
``
father
''
of
the
Rural_Electrification_Administration
and
the
Security
and
Exchange_Commission
.
But
to
run_the_gauntlet
of
the
programs
Sam_Rayburn
brought bring%2:35:04::
into
being
through
his
legislative
efforts
would
fill fill%2:30:01::
the
pages
of
today
's
Record
.
No
greater
pleasure
has
come come%2:38:00::
to
me
in
my
own
service
in_this
House
than
to
be be%2:42:03::
present
today
to
participate participate%2:41:00::
in_this
tribute
to
this
great
Speaker
,
this
great
legislator
,
this
great
Texan
,
this
great
American
.
My
sincere
wish
is be%2:42:06::
that
he
continues continue%2:42:01::
to
add add%2:30:00::
to
this
record
he
sets set%2:32:01::
here
today
.
Sam_Rayburn
is be%2:42:03::
one
of
the
greatest
American
public
figures
in
the
history
of
our
country
and
I
consider consider%2:31:00::
that
I
have
been
signally
honored honor%2:41:00::
in
the
privilege
of
knowing know%2:31:00::
Sam_Rayburn
and
sharing share%2:40:02::
with
him
the
rights
and
obligations
of
a
Member
of
the
House_of_Representatives
in
the
Congress
of
the
United_States
.
Others
may
speak speak%2:32:00::
of
Speaker_Rayburn
'
S
uniquely
long
and
devoted
service
;
of
his
championship
of
many_of
the
progressive
social
measures
which
adorn adorn%2:36:00::
our
statute_books
today
,
and
of
his
cooperation
in
times
of
adversity
with
Presidents
of
both
of
our
major
parties
in
helping help%2:41:00::
to
pilot pilot%2:38:01::
the
Ship
of
State
through
the
shoals
of
today
's
stormy
international
seas
.
I
prefer prefer%2:31:00::
to
speak speak%2:32:00::
,
however
,
of
Sam_Rayburn
,
the
person
,
rather_than
Sam_Rayburn
,
the
American
institution
.
Although
Sam_Rayburn
affects affect%2:32:00::
a
gruff
exterior
in
many
instances
,
nevertheless
he
is be%2:42:03::
fundamentally
a
man
of
warm
heart
and
gentle
disposition
.
No
one
could
be be%2:42:03::
more
devoted
than
he
to
the
American_Congress
as
an
institution
and
more
aware_of
its
historical
significance
in
the
political
history
of
the
world
,
and
I
shall
never
forget forget%2:31:01::
his
moving
talks
,
delivered deliver%2:32:00::
in
simple
yet
eloquent
words
,
upon
the
meaning
of
our
jobs
as
Representatives
in
the
operation
of
representative
government
and
their
importance
in
the
context
of
today
's
assault
upon
popular
government
.
Above_all
,
he
is be%2:42:03::
a
person
to
whom
a
fledgling
Representative
can
go go%2:38:00::
to
discuss discuss%2:32:00::
the
personal
and
professional
problems
which
inevitably
confront confront%2:32:03::
a
new
Congressman

In_this

of
