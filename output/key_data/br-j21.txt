In
1
we
investigate investigate%2:32:00::
a
new
series
of
line
involutions
in
a
projective
space
of
three
dimensions
over
the
field
of
complex_numbers
.
These
are
defined define%2:42:00::
by
a
simple
involutorial
transformation
of
the
points
in_which
a
general
line
meets meet%2:42:02::
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
bearing bear%2:42:01::
a
curve
of
symbol
*
*
f
.
Then
in
2
we
show show%2:32:00::
that
any
line
involution
with
the
properties
that
(
a
)
It
has have%2:42:00::
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
,
and
(
b
)
Its
singular
lines
form form%2:42:00::
a
complex
consisting consist_of%2:42:00::
exclusively
of
the
lines
which
meet meet%2:42:02::
a
twisted
curve
,
is be%2:42:03::
necessarily
of
the
type
discussed discuss%2:32:01::
in
1
.
No
generalization
of
these
results
to
spaces
of
more_than
three
dimensions
has
so_far
been
found find%2:32:00::
possible
.
Let
Q
be be%2:42:08::
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
bearing bear%2:42:01::
reguli
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
,
and
let
\
g
be be%2:42:08::
a
*
*
f
curve
of
order
k
on
Q
.
A
general
line
l
meets meet%2:42:02::
Q
in
two
points
,
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
,
through
each
of_which
passes pass%2:42:08::
a
unique
generator
of
the
regulus
,
*
*
f
,
whose
lines
are be%2:42:06::
simple
secants
of
\
g
.
On
these
generators
let
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
be be%2:42:08::
,
respectively
,
the
harmonic
conjugates
of
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
with_respect_to
the
two
points
in_which
the
corresponding
generator
meets meet%2:42:02::
\
g
.
The
line
*
*
f
is be%2:42:06::
the
image
of
l
.
Clearly
,
the
transformation
is be%2:42:03::
involutorial
.
We
observe observe%2:32:00::
first
that
no
line
,
l
,
can
meet meet%2:42:02::
its
image
except
at
one
of
its
intersections
with
Q
.
For
if
it
did
,
the
plane
of
l
and
l
'
would
contain contain%2:42:00::
two
generators
of
*
*
f
,
which
is be%2:42:03::
impossible
.
Moreover
,
from
the
definitive
transformation
of
intercepts
on
the
generators
of
*
*
f
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
clear
that
the
only
points
of
Q
at
which
a
line
can
meets meet%2:42:02::
its
image
are be%2:42:06::
the
points
of
\
g
.
Hence
the
totality
of
singular
lines
is be%2:42:06::
the
kth
order
complex
of
lines
which
meet meet%2:42:02::
\
g
.
The
invariant
lines
are be%2:42:06::
the
lines
of
the
congruence
of
secants
of
\
g
,
since
each
of
these
meets meet%2:42:02::
Q
in
two
points
which
are be%2:42:03::
invariant
.
The
order
of_this
congruence
is be%2:42:06::
*
*
f
,
since
*
*
f
secants
of
a
curve
of
symbol
(
a
,
b
)
on
a
quadric
surface
pass pass%2:42:08::
through
an
arbitrary
point
.
The
class
of
the
congruence
is be%2:42:06::
*
*
f
,
since
an
arbitrary
plane
meets meet%2:42:02::
\
g
in
k
points
.
Since
the
complex
of
singular
lines
is be%2:42:03::
of
order
k
and
since
there
is
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
,
it
follows follow%2:42:05::
from
the
formula
*
*
f
that
the
order
of
the
involution
is be%2:42:06::
*
*
f
.
There
are
various
sets
of
exceptional
lines
,
or
lines
whose
images
are be%2:42:03::
not
unique
.
The_most
obvious
of
these
is be%2:42:06::
the
quadratic
complex
of
tangents
to
Q
,
each
line
of_which
is
transformed transform%2:30:02::
into
the
entire
pencil
of
lines
tangent
to
Q
at
the
image
of
the
point
of
tangency
of
the
given
line
.
Thus
pencils
of
tangents
to
Q
are
transformed transform%2:30:02::
into
pencils
of
tangents
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
interesting
that
a
1
:
1
correspondence
can
be
established establish%2:31:00::
between
the
lines
of
two
such
pencils
,
so_that
in_a_sense
a
unique
image
can
actually
be
assigned assign%2:41:00::
to
each
tangent
.
For
the
lines
of
any
plane
,
|
p
,
meeting meet%2:42:02::
Q
in
a
conic
C
,
are
transformed transform%2:30:02::
into
the
congruence
of
secants
of
the
curve
C
'
into
which
C
is
transformed transform%2:30:02::
in
the
point
involution
on
Q
.
In_particular
,
tangents
to
C
are
transformed transform%2:30:02::
into
tangents
to
C
'
.
Moreover
,
if
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
are be%2:42:06::
two
planes
intersecting intersect%2:38:00::
in
a
line
l
,
tangent
to
Q
at
a
point
P
,
the
two
free
intersections
of
the
image
curves
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
must
coincide coincide%2:42:00::
at
P
'
,
the
image
of
P
,
and
at
this
point
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
must
have have%2:42:00::
a
common
tangent
l
'
.
Hence
,
thought_of think_of%2:31:01::
as
a
line
in
a
particular
plane
|
p
,
any
tangent
to
Q
has have%2:42:00::
a
unique
image
and
moreover
this
image
is be%2:42:03::
the
same
for
all
planes
through
l
.
Each
generator
,
|
l
,
of
*
*
f
is be%2:42:03::
also
exceptional
,
for
each
is
transformed transform%2:30:02::
into
the
entire
congruence
of
secants
of
the
curve
into
which
that
generator
is
transformed transform%2:30:02::
by
the
point
involution
on
Q
.
This
curve
is be%2:42:03::
of
symbol
*
*
f
since
it
meets meet%2:42:02::
|
l
,
and
hence
every
line
of
*
*
f
in
the
*
*
f
invariant
points
on
|
l
and
since
it
obviously
meets meet%2:42:02::
every
line
of
*
*
f
in
a
single
point
.
The
congruence
of
its
secants
is be%2:42:03::
therefore
of
order
*
*
f
and
class
*
*
f
.
A
final
class
of
exceptional
lines
is be%2:42:03::
identifiable
from
the
following
considerations
:
Since
no
two
generators
of
*
*
f
can
intersect intersect%2:38:00::
,
it
follows follow%2:42:05::
that
their
image
curves
can
have have%2:42:00::
no
free
intersections
.
In_other_words
,
these
curves
have have%2:42:00::
only
fixed
intersections
common
to
them
all
.
Now
the
only
way
in_which
all
curves
of
the
image
family
of
*
*
f
can
pass pass%2:42:08::
through
a
fixed
point
is be%2:42:06::
to
have have%2:40:00::
a
generator
of
*
*
f
which
is be%2:42:06::
not
a
secant
but
a
tangent
of
\
g
,
for
then
any
point
on
such
a
generator
will
be
transformed transform%2:30:02::
into
the
point
of
tangency
.
Since
two
curves
of
symbol
*
*
f
on
Q
intersect intersect%2:38:00::
in
*
*
f
points
,
it
follows follow%2:42:05::
that
there
are
*
*
f
lines
of
*
*
f
which
are be%2:42:03::
tangent
to
\
g
.
Clearly
,
any
line
,
l
,
of
any
bundle
having have%2:40:00::
one
of
these
points
of
tangency
,
T
,
as
vertex
will
be
transformed transform%2:30:02::
into
the
entire
pencil
having have%2:40:00::
the
image
of
the
second
intersection
of
l
and
Q
as
vertex
and
lying lie%2:42:00::
in
the
plane
determined determine%2:31:03::
by
the
image
point
and
the
generator
of
*
*
f
which
is be%2:42:03::
tangent
to
\
g
at
T
.
A
line
through
two
of
these
points
,
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
,
will
be
transformed transform%2:30:02::
into
the
entire
bilinear
congruence
having have%2:40:00::
the
tangents
to
\
g
at
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
as
directrices
.
A
conic
,
C
,
being be%2:42:06::
a
(
1
,
1
)
curve
on
Q
,
meets meet%2:42:02::
the
image
of
any
line
of
*
*
f
,
which
we
have
already
found find%2:32:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
a
*
*
f
curve
on
Q
,
in
*
*
f
points
.
Hence
its
image
,
C
'
,
meets meet%2:42:02::
any
line
of
*
*
f
in
*
*
f
points
.
Moreover
,
C
'
obviously
meets meet%2:42:02::
any
line
*
*
f
in
a
single
point
.
Hence
C
'
is be%2:42:06::
a
*
*
f
curve
on
Q
.
Therefore
,
the
congruence
of
its
secants
,
that_is
the
image
of
a
general
plane
field
of
lines
,
is be%2:42:03::
of
order
*
*
f
and
class
*
*
f
.
Finally
,
the
image
of
a
general
bundle
of
lines
is be%2:42:06::
a
congruence
whose
order
is be%2:42:06::
the
order
of
the
congruence
of
invariant
lines
,
namely
*
*
f
and
whose
class
is be%2:42:06::
the
order
of
the
image
congruence
of
a
general
plane
field
of
lines
,
namely
*
*
f
.
The
preceding
observations
make make%2:30:00::
it
clear
that
there
exist exist%2:42:00::
line
involutions
of
all
orders
greater
than
1
with
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
and
with
a
complex
of
singular
lines
consisting consist_of%2:42:00::
exclusively
of
the
lines
which
meet meet%2:42:02::
a
twisted
curve
\
g
.
We
now
shall
show show%2:32:00::
that
any
involution
with
these
characteristics
is be%2:42:06::
necessarily
of
the
type
we
have
just
described describe%2:32:01::
.
To
do do%2:41:04::
this
we
must
first
show show%2:32:00::
that
every
line
which
meets meet%2:42:02::
\
g
in
a
point
P
meets meet%2:42:02::
its
image
at
P
.
To
see see%2:31:01::
this
,
consider consider%2:31:01::
a
general
pencil
of
lines
containing contain%2:42:00::
a
general
secant
of
\
G
.
By
(
1
)
,
the
image
of_this
pencil
is be%2:42:06::
a
ruled
surface
of
order
*
*
f
which
is
met meet%2:42:02::
by
the
plane
of
the
pencil
in
a
curve
,
C
,
of
order
*
*
f
.
On
C
there
is be%2:42:05::
a
*
*
f
correspondence
in_which
the
*
*
f
points
cut cut%2:38:08::
from
C
by
a
general
line
,
l
,
of
the
pencil
correspond correspond%2:42:00::
to
the
point_of_intersection
of
the
image
of
l
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
.
Since
C
is be%2:42:03::
rational
,
this
correspondence
has have%2:42:00::
k
coincidences
,
each
of_which
implies imply%2:42:00::
a
line
of
the
pencil
which
meets meet%2:42:02::
its
image
.
However
,
since
the
pencil
contains contain%2:42:00::
a
secant
of
\
g
it
actually
contains contain%2:42:00::
only
*
*
f
singular
lines
.
To
avoid avoid%2:41:01::
this
contradiction
it
is be%2:42:03::
necessary
that
C
be be%2:42:03::
composite
,
with
the
secant
of
\
g
and
a
curve
of
order
*
*
f
as
components
.
Thus
it
follows follow%2:42:05::
that
the
secants
of
\
g
are be%2:42:03::
all
invariant
.
But
if
this
is be%2:42:06::
the
case
,
then
an
arbitrary
pencil
of
lines
having have%2:42:00::
a
point
,
P
,
of
\
g
as
vertex
is
transformed transform%2:30:02::
into
a
ruled
surface
of
order
*
*
f
having have%2:40:00::
*
*
f
generators
concurrent
at
P
.
Since
a
ruled
surface
of
order
n
with
n
concurrent
generators
is be%2:42:06::
necessarily
a
cone
,
it
follows follow%2:42:05::
finally
that
every
line
through
a
point
,
P
,
of
\
g
meets meet%2:42:02::
its
image
at
P
,
as
asserted assert%2:32:01::
.
Now
consider consider%2:31:01::
the
transformation
of
the
lines
of
a
bundle
with
vertex
,
P
,
on
\
g
which
is
effected effect%2:36:00::
by
the
involution
as_a_whole
.
From
the
preceding
remarks
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
clear
that
such
a
bundle
is
transformed transform%2:30:02::
into
itself
in
an
involutorial
fashion
.
Moreover
,
in_this
involution
there
is be%2:42:05::
a
cone
of
invariant
lines
of
order
*
*
f
,
namely
the
cone
of
secants
of
\
g
which
pass pass%2:42:08::
through
P
.
Hence
it
follows follow%2:42:05::
that
the
involution
within
the
bundle
must
be be%2:42:06::
a
perspective
de
Jonquieres
involution
of
order
*
*
f
and
the
invariant
locus
must
have have%2:42:00::
a
multiple
line
of
multiplicity
either
*
*
f
or
*
*
f
.
The
first
possibility
requires require%2:42:00::
that
there
be
a
line
through
P
which
meets meet%2:42:02::
\
g
in
*
*
f
points
;
the
second
requires require%2:42:00::
that
there
be
a
line
through
P
which
meets meet%2:42:02::
\
g
in
*
*
f
points
.
In
each
case
,
lines
of
the
bundles
are
transformed transform%2:30:02::
by
involutions
within
the
pencils
they
determine determine%2:31:03::
with
the
multiple
secant
.
In
the
first
case
the
fixed
elements
within
each
pencil
are be%2:42:06::
the
multiple
secant
and
the
line
joining join%2:35:01::
the
vertex
,
P
,
to
the
intersection
of
\
g
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
which
does
not
lie lie%2:42:00::
on
the
multiple
secant
.
In
the
second
,
the
fixed
elements
are be%2:42:06::
the
lines
which
join join%2:35:01::
the
vertex
,
P
,
to
the
two
intersections
of
\
g
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
which
do
not
lie lie%2:42:00::
on
the
multiple
secant
.
The
multiple
secants
,
of_course
,
are be%2:42:03::
exceptional
and
in
each
case
are
transformed transform%2:30:02::
into
cones
of
order
*
*
f
.
Observations
similar
to
these
can
be
made make%2:31:00::
at
each
point
of
\
g
.
Hence
\
g
must
have have%2:42:00::
either
a
regulus
of
*
*
f-fold
secants
or
a
regulus
of
*
*
f-fold
secants
.
Moreover
,
if
*
*
f
,
no
two
of
the
multiple
secants
can
intersect intersect%2:38:00::
.
For
if
such
were be%2:42:06::
the
case
,
either
the
plane
of
the
two
lines
would
meet meet%2:42:02::
\
g
in
more_than
k
points
or
,
alternatively
,
the
order
of
the
image
regulus
of
the
pencil
determined determine%2:31:03::
by
the
two
lines
would
be be%2:42:03::
too
high
.
But
if
no
two
lines
of
the
regulus
of
multiple
secants
of
\
g
can
intersect intersect%2:38:00::
,
then
the
regulus
must
be be%2:42:03::
quadratic
,
or
in_other_words
,
\
g
must
be be%2:42:06::
either
a
*
*
f
or
a
*
*
f
curve
on
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
.
We
now
observe observe%2:32:00::
that
the
case
in_which
\
g
is be%2:42:06::
a
*
*
f
curve
on
a
quadric
is be%2:42:03::
impossible
if
the
complex
of
singular
lines
consists consist_of%2:42:00::
exclusively
of
the

For
any
pencil
in
a
plane
containing contain%2:42:00::
a

f-fold
secant

has have%2:42:00::
an
image

meets meet%2:42:02::
the

,
namely
the

pass pass%2:42:08::

However
,
if

the
order

This
contradicts contradict%2:42:00::
the
preceding
observations

so
,
under

we
must
reject reject%2:31:00::
the

Continuing continue%2:32:00::
with
the
case
in_which
\

a

,
we
first
observe observe%2:32:00::
that
the

the

For
each

three

namely
two

one

Now
consider consider%2:31:01::
an

If

the

the

the

it
