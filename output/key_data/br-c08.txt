Had have%2:40:00::
a
funny
experience
at
Newport
yesterday
afternoon
.
Sat sit%2:35:00::
there
and
as
a
woman
sang sing%2:36:00::
,
she
kept keep%2:42:07::
getting get%2:30:00::
thinner
and
thinner
,
right
before
my
eyes
,
and
the
eyes
of
some
5500
other
people
.
I
make make%2:36:00::
this
observation
about
the
lady
,
Miss_Judy_Garland
,
because
she
brought_up bring_up%2:36:00::
the
subject
herself
in
telling tell%2:32:04::
a
story
about
a
British
female
reporter
who
flattered flatter%2:32:00::
her
terribly
in
London
recently
and_then
wrote write%2:36:00::
in
the
paper
the
next
day
:
``
Judy_Garland
has
arrived arrive%2:38:00::
in
London
.
She
's be%2:42:03::
not
chubby
.
She
's be%2:42:03::
not
plump
.
She
's be%2:42:03::
fat
''
.
But
who
cares care%2:37:02::
,
when
the
lady
sings sing%2:36:00::
?
Certainly
not
the
largest
afternoon
audience
Newport
has
ever
had have%2:40:00::
at
a
jazz
concert
and
the_most
attentive
and
quiet
.
They
applauded applaud%2:32:01::
every
number
,
not_only
at
its
conclusion
but
also
at
the
first
statement
of
the
theme
-
sometimes
at
the
first
chord
.
And
Judy
sang sing%2:36:01::
the
lovely
old
familiar
things
which
seemed seem%2:39:01::
,
at_times
,
a
blessed
relief
from
the
way-out
compositions
of
the
progressive
jazzmen
who
have
dominated dominate%2:42:00::
these
proceedings
.
Things
like
``
When_You're_Smiling
''
,
``
Almost_Like_Being_In_Love
''
,
``
Do_It_Again
''
,
``
Born_to_Wander
''
,
``
Alone
Together
''
,
``
Who_Cares
?
''
,
``
Puttin
'
on
the
Ritz
''
,
``
How_Long_Has_This_Been_Going_On
?
''
and
her
own
personal
songs
like
``
The_Man_That_Got_Away
''
,
and
the
inevitable
``
Over
the
Rainbow
''
.
Miss_Garland
is be%2:42:03::
not_only
one
of
the
great
singers
of
our
time
but
she
is be%2:42:03::
one
of
the
superb
showmen
.
At_the_start
of
her
program
there
were be%2:42:00::
evidences
of
pique
.
She
had
held hold%2:32:13::
to
the
letter
of
her
contract
and
did
n't
come come%2:30:02::
onto
the
stage
until
well
after
4
p.
m.
,
the
appointed
hour
,
although
the
Music
at
Newport
people
had
tried try%2:41:00::
to
get get%2:30:02::
the
program
underway
at
3
.
Then
there
was be%2:42:00::
a
bad
delay
in
getting get%2:30:02::
Mort_Lindsey
's
30
-
piece
orchestra
wedged wedge%2:35:01::
into
its
chairs
.
Along
about
4
:
30
,
just
when
it
was
getting_to get_to%2:30:00::
be
about
time
to
turn
the
audience
over
and
toast
them
on
the
other
side
,
Judy
came_on come_on%2:30:01::
singing sing%2:36:00::
,
in
a
short-skirted
blue
dress
with
a
blue
and
white
jacket
that
flapped flap%2:38:01::
in
the
wind
.
Her
bouffant
coiffure
was
fortunately
combed
on_the_left
which
happened happen%2:41:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
the
direction
from
which
a
brisk
breeze
was
blowing blow%2:43:00::
.
In
her
first
song
she
waved wave%2:32:00::
away
one
encroaching
photographer
who
dared dare%2:41:00::
approach approach%2:38:00::
the
throne
unbidden
and
thereafter
the
boys
with
the
cameras
had_to
unsheathe unsheathe%2:35:00::
their
300
mm.
lenses
and
shoot shoot%2:32:00::
at
extreme
range
.
There
also
came come%2:30:01::
a
brief
contretemps
with
the
sound
mixers
who
made make%2:41:00::
the
mistake
of
being
overheard overhear%2:39:00::
during
a
quiet
moment
near
the
conclusion
of
``
Do_It_Again
''
,
and
she
made make%2:41:00::
the
tart
observation
that
``
I
never
saw see%2:39:02::
so_much
moving move%2:38:00::
about
in
an
audience
''
.
But
it
did
n't
take take%2:40:06::
Judy_Garland
,
showman
,
long
to
realize realize%2:31:01::
that
this
sort_of
thing
was be%2:42:03::
par
for
the
course
at
Newport
and
that
you
have_to
learn learn%2:31:00::
to
live live%2:42:04::
with_it
.
Before
her
chore
was
finished finish%2:30:02::
she
was
rescuing rescue%2:41:00::
wind-blown
sheets
of
music
,
trundling trundle%2:38:00::
microphones
about
the
stage
,
helping help%2:41:00::
to
move move%2:38:01::
the
piano
and
otherwise
joining join%2:41:00::
in
the
informal
atmosphere
.
And
time
after
time
she
really
belted_out belt_out%2:36:00::
her
songs
.
Sometimes
they
struck strike%2:37:00::
me
as
horribly
over-arranged
-
which
was be%2:42:03::
the
way
I
felt feel%2:37:00::
about
her
``
Come_Rain_or_Come_Shine
''
-
and
sometimes
they
were be%2:42:03::
just
plain
magnificent
,
like
her
shatteringly
beautiful
``
Beautiful
Weather
''
.
To
her
partisan
audience
,
such
picayune
haggling
would
have
seemed seem%2:39:00::
nothing
more_than
a
critic
striving strive%2:41:00::
to
hold hold%2:42:00::
his
franchise
;
they
just
sat_back sit_back%2:29:00::
on
their
haunches
and
cried cry%2:32:01::
for
more
,
as
though
they
could
never
get get%2:40:00::
enough
.
They
were
rewarded reward%2:41:01::
with
splendid
,
exciting
,
singing
.
Her
``
Rockabye
Your
Baby
''
was be%2:42:03::
as_good_as
it
can
be
done do%2:36:01::
,
and
her
really
personal
songs
,
like
``
The_Man_That_Got_Away
''
were be%2:42:03::
deeply
moving
.
The
audience
would
n't
let let%2:41:00::
her
leave leave%2:38:01::
until
it
had
heard hear%2:39:00::
``
Over
The
Rainbow
''
-
although
the
fellow
that
kept keep%2:42:07::
crying cry%2:32:01::
for
``
Get_Happy
''
had_to
go_home go_home%2:38:00::
unhappy
,
about
that
item
anyway
.
She
was be%2:42:03::
generous
with
her
encores
and
the
audience
was be%2:42:03::
equally
so
with
its
cheers
and
applause
and
flowers
.
All
went_home go_home%2:38:00::
happy
except
the
Newport
police
,
who
feared fear%2:37:03::
that
the
throng
departing depart%2:38:04::
at
6
:
35
might
meet meet%2:38:01::
head-on
the
night
crowd
drawing draw%2:38:02::
nigh
,
and
those
deprived_of
their
happy_hour
at
the
cocktail
bar
.
In
Newport
last
night
there
were be%2:42:00::
flashes
of
distant
lightning
in
the
northern
skies
.
This
was be%2:42:03::
perhaps
symbolic
of
the
jazz
of
the
evening
-
flashes
in
the
distance
,
but
no
storm
.
Several_times
it
came_near
breaking break%2:30:05::
,
and
there
were be%2:42:00::
in_fact
some
lovely
peals
of
thunder
from
Jerry_Mulligan
's
big_band
,
which
is be%2:42:03::
about
as
fine
an
aggregation
as
has
come_along come_along%2:30:00::
in
the
jazz
business
since
John_Hammond
found find%2:40:02::
Count_Basie
working work%2:41:00::
in
a
Kansas_City
trap
.
Mulligan
's
band
has
been
infected infect%2:31:00::
with
his
solid
sense
of
swing
,
and
what
it
does do%2:36:01::
seems seem%2:39:01::
far
more
meaningful
than
most_of
the
noise
generated generate%2:36:00::
by
the
big
concert
aggregations
.
But
what
is be%2:42:03::
equally
impressive
is be%2:42:03::
the
delicacy
and
wonderful
lyric
quality
of
both
the
band
and
Mulligan
's
baritone
sax
in
a
fragile
ballad
like
Bob_Brookmeyer
's
arrangement
of
``
Django
's
Castle
''
.
For
subtle
swinging
rhythms
,
I
could
admire admire%2:37:00::
intensely
Mulligan
's
version
of
``
Weep
''
,
and
the
fireworks
went go%2:41:00::
on
display
in
``
18
Carrots
for
Robert
''
,
a
sax
tribute
to
Johnny_Hodges
.
There
was be%2:42:00::
considerable
contrast
between
this
Mulligan
performance
and
that
of
Art_Blakey
and
The
Jazz
Messengers
,
who
are be%2:42:03::
able_to
generate generate%2:36:00::
a
tremendous
sound
for
such
a
small
group
.
Unfortunately
,
Blakey
does
n't
choose choose%2:31:02::
to
work work%2:41:00::
much
of
the
time
in_this
vein
.
He
prefers prefer%2:37:00::
to
have have%2:42:00::
his
soloist
performing
and
thus
we
get get%2:30:03::
only
brief
glimpses
of_what
his
ensemble
work
is be%2:42:03::
like
.
What
we
did
get get%2:40:00::
,
however
,
was be%2:42:03::
impressive
.
A_few
drops
of
rain
just
before
midnight
,
when
Sarah_Vaughan
was be%2:42:03::
in_the_midst
of
her
first
number
,
scattered scatter%2:38:01::
the
more
timid
members
of
the
audience
briefly
,
but
at
this
hour
and
with
Sarah
on
the
stand
,
most_of
the
listeners
did
n't
care care%2:37:02::
whether
they
got get%2:30:00::
wet
.
Miss_Vaughan
was be%2:42:03::
back
in
top
form
,
somehow
mellowed
and
improved
with
the
passage
of
time
-
like
a
fine
wine
.
After
the
spate
of
female
vocalists
we
have
been
having have%2:39:06::
,
all_of
whom
took take%2:31:03::
Sarah
as
a
point
of
departure
and_then
tried try%2:41:00::
to
see see%2:32:00::
what
they
could
do do%2:36:01::
that
might
make
her
seem seem%2:39:00::
old
hat
,
it
seemed seem%2:39:00::
that
all
that
has
happened happen%2:30:00::
is be%2:42:03::
to
make make%2:30:00::
the
real_thing
seem seem%2:39:01::
better
than
ever
.
The
evening
program
was
opened open%2:41:00::
by
the
Jazz
Three
,
a
Newport
group
consisting_of consist_of%2:42:00::
Steve_Budieshein
on
bass
,
Jack_Warner
,
drums
,
and
Don_Cook
,
piano
.
This
was be%2:42:03::
a
continuation
of
a
good
idea
which
was be%2:42:03::
first
tried_out try_out%2:41:00::
Saturday
night
when
the
Eddie_Stack
group
,
also
local
talent
,
went go%2:41:00::
on
first
.
Putting_on put_on%2:36:01::
local
musicians
at_this_place
in
the
program
serves serve%2:42:03::
a
triple
purpose
:
it
saves save%2:41:01::
the
top
flight
jazz
men
from
being
wasted waste%2:40:00::
in_this
unenviable
spot
,
when
the
audience
is be%2:42:03::
cold
,
restless
,
and
in
flux
;
it
prevents prevent%2:41:00::
late-comers
from
missing miss%2:42:01::
some
of
the
people
they
have
come come%2:38:04::
a
long
way
to
hear hear%2:39:00::
,
and
it
gives give%2:40:05::
the
resident
musicians
a
chance
to
perform perform%2:36:01::
before
the
famous
Newport
audience
.
The
Jazz
Three
displayed display%2:39:00::
their
sound
musicianship
,
not_only
in
their
own
chosen
set
,
but
as
the
emergency
accompanists
for
Al_Minns
+
Leon_James
,
the
superb
jazz
dancers
who
have
now
been be%2:42:03::
Newport
performers
for
three
successive
years
,
gradually
moving_up move_up%2:38:01::
from
a
morning
seminar
on
the
evolution
of
the_blues
to
a
spot
on
the
evening
program
.
Julie_Wilson
,
a
vigorous
vocalist
without
many
wild
twists
,
sang sing%2:36:01::
a
set
,
a
large
part
of_which
consisted_of consist_of%2:42:00::
such
seldom
heard hear%2:39:00::
old
oldies
as
``
Hard-Hearted_Hannah
,
the
Vamp
of
Savannah
''
,
and
the
delightful
``
Sunday
''
.
She
frosted frost%2:35:00::
the
cake
with
the
always
reliable
``
Bill_Bailey
''
.
From
this
taste
of
the
1920
s
,
we
leaped
way_out
to
Stan_Getz
's
private
brand
of
progressive
jazz
,
which
did do%2:41:01::
lovely
,
subtle
things
for
``
Baubles
,
Bangles
and
Beads
''
,
and
a_couple_of
ballards
.
Getz
is be%2:42:03::
a
difficult
musician
to
categorize categorize%2:31:00::
.
He
plays play%2:36:01::
his
sax
principally
for
beauty
of
tone
,
rather_than
for
scintillating
flights
of
meaningless
improvisations
,
and
he
has have%2:40:00::
a
quiet
way
of
getting_back get_back%2:38:00::
and
restating restate%2:32:00::
the
melody
after
the
improvising
is be%2:42:03::
over
.
In_this
he
is
sticking_with stick_with%2:42:00::
tradition
,
however
far
removed
from_it
he
may
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
.
George_Shearing
took_over take_over%2:40:07::
with
his
well
disciplined
group
,
a
sextet
consisting_of consist_of%2:42:00::
vibes
,
guitar
,
bass
,
drums
,
Shearing
's
piano
and
a
bongo
drummer
.
He
met meet%2:42:00::
with
enthusiastic
audience
approval
,
especially
when
he
swung swing%2:30:08::
from
jazz
to
Latin_American
things
like
the
Mambo
.
Shearing
,
himself
,
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
me
to
be
playing play%2:36:01::
better
piano
than
in
his
recent
Newport
appearances
.
A
very
casual
,
pleasant
program
-
one
of
those
easy-going
things
that
make make%2:30:00::
Newport
's
afternoon
programs
such
a
relaxing
delight
-
was
held hold%2:36:00::
again
under
sunny
skies
,
hot
sun
,
and
a
fresh_breeze
for
an
audience
of
at_least
a_couple_of
thousands
who
came come%2:38:00::
to
Newport
to
hear hear%2:39:00::
music
rather_than
go go%2:38:00::
to
the
beach
.
Divided divide%2:41:00::
almost
equally
into
two
parts
,
it
consisted_of consist_of%2:42:00::
``
The
Evolution
of
the_Blues
''
,
narrated narrate%2:32:01::
by
Jon_Hendricks
,
who
had
presented present%2:39:00::
it
last
year
at
the
Monterey
,
Calif.
,
Jazz_Festival
,
and
an
hour-long
session
of
Maynard_Ferguson
and
his
orchestra
,
a
blasting
big_band
.
Hendricks
'
story
was
designed design%2:31:00::
for
children
and
he
had have%2:40:00::
a
small
audience
of
small
children
right_on
stage
with
him
.
Tracing trace%2:38:01::
the_blues
from
its
African
roots
among
the
slaves
who
were
brought bring%2:38:00::
to
this
country
and
the
West_Indies
,
he
stressed stress%2:32:00::
the
close
relationship
between
the
early
jazz
forms
and
the
music
of
the
Negro
churches
.
To
help help%2:41:00::
him
on
this
religious
aspect
of
primitive
jazz
he
had have%2:40:00::
``
Big

Miller
,
as
a
preacher-singer
and
Hannah_Dean
,
Gospel-singer
,
while
Oscar_Brown_Jr.
,
an
extremely
talented
young_man
,
did do%2:41:01::
a
slave
auctioneer

call
,
a
field-hands

work_song
,
and
a
beautifully
sung
Negro
lullaby
,
``
Brown_Baby
''
,
which
was be%2:42:03::
one
of
the
truly
moving
moments
of
the
festival
.
One
of
those
delightful
surprise
additions
,
which
so
frequently
occur occur%2:30:00::
