Vermont

prostrate

And
in
the
dark
days
after
the
Great_Flood
of
1927
-
the
worst
natural
disaster
in

state
's
history
-
the
little

was be%2:42:03::
its

Rain

had
fallen fall%2:38:03::
for
three
full
days
and
it
was
still
raining rain%2:43:00::
on
the
morning
of
Friday
,
November

,
1927
,
when
officials
of
the
Post_Office_Department
's
Railway_Mail_Service
realized realize%2:31:01::
that
their
distribution
system
for
Vermont
had
been
almost
totally
destroyed destroy%2:36:00::
overnight

Clerks

shoveled shovel%2:35:00::

still
had have%2:40:00::

and
wondered wonder%2:32:01::
how

The
state
's
railroad
system
counted count%2:32:00::
miles
of
broken
bridges
and
missing
rights-of-way
:
it
would
obviously
remain remain%2:30:00::
out

And
once
medicine

had
been
provided provide%2:34:00::
for

victims
,
communications

the

were be%2:42:03::
the

From

outgoing

could
be
ferried ferry%2:38:02::

But
what

The

at

When

National_Guard
planes
to
fly fly%2:35:00::
the
mail
in

state

it
seemed seem%2:39:00::
a
likely
temporary
solution
,
easing ease%2:30:00::
Burlington
's
bottleneck
and
that
at
Montpelier
too
.
The
question
was be%2:42:06::
``
Where
to
land land%2:38:00::
''
?
There
was be%2:42:00::
no
such
thing
as
an
airport
in
Vermont
.
Burlington
aviator
John_J._Burns
suggested suggest%2:32:00::
the

southwest
of
Fort_Ethan_Allen
,
and
soon
a

hastily-summoned

DeHaviland

of
the
military

.
The
only
available
field
that
could
be
used use%2:34:01::
near
flood-ravaged
Montpelier
was be%2:42:05::
on
the
Towne
farm
off
upper
Main_Street
,
a
narrow
hillside
where
takeoffs
and
landings
could
be
safely
made make%2:41:00::
only
under
light
wind
conditions
.
Over
in
Barre
the
streets
had
been be%2:42:03::
deep
in

and

were be%2:42:03::
crumpled

gone
.
Anticipating anticipate%2:31:00::

the
Sunday
following follow%2:42:00::

Though
the
makeshift

were be%2:42:03::
ready
,
the
York_State_Guard

proved prove%2:42:00::
unable
to

They

raised raise%2:36:01::

with
the
water

engines
of

It
seemed seem%2:39:00::
like
a
good
time

to

a

Down

was be%2:42:00::
a
flier
in
the
right

at
the
right

:
Robert_S._Fogg

a
native
New_Englander

had
been be%2:42:04::
a
World_War

flying

,
barnstormer
,
and
one
of
the
original

of

Tall

Bob_Fogg

Piloting pilot%2:38:00::
a

in
1925
,
he
had
inaugurated inaugurate%2:41:00::
the
original
Rural

in

During
the
excitement
following follow%2:42:00::
Lindbergh
's
flight
to
Paris
earlier
in
1927
,
dare
devil
aviators
overnight
became become%2:42:01::
legendary
heroes
.
In
Concord
,
Bob_Fogg
was be%2:42:06::
the_most
prominent
New_Hampshire
boy
with
wings
.
Public-spirited
backers
staked stake%2:41:00::
him
to
a
brand-new
airplane
,
aimed aim%2:31:01::
at
putting put%2:35:05::
their
city
and
state
on
the
flying
map
.
The
ship
was be%2:42:06::
a
Waco
biplane
,
one
of
the
first
two
of
its
type
to
be
fitted fit%2:40:00::
with

225

known
as

.
A
trim
green

only

,
the
Waco

entered enter%2:41:06::
to
compete compete%2:33:00::
in
the
``
On-to-Spokane
''
Air_Derby
of
1927
.
As_a_matter_of_fact
,
Fogg
and
his
plane
did
n't
get get%2:38:00::
beyond
Pennsylvania
in
the
race
-
an
engine
oil
leak
forced force%2:35:01::
him
down
-
but
the
flying
service
and
school
he
started start%2:36:00::
subsequently
were be%2:42:03::
first_steps
in
paying_off pay_off%2:40:03::
his
wry-faced
backers
.
So
with
all
this
experience
,
Bob_Fogg
was be%2:42:03::
a
natural
choice
to
receive receive%2:40:00::
the
first
Emergency
Air_Mail
Star_Route
contract
.
His
work
began begin%2:30:00::
just
six
days
after
the
flood
.
By
airline
from
Concord
to
Burlington
is be%2:42:07::
a
distance
of
about
150
miles
,
counting count%2:32:00::
a
slight
deviation
for
the
stop
at
either
Barre
or
Montpelier
.
The
first
few
days
Bob_Fogg
set set_down%2:38:01::
his
plane
down
on
Towne
field
back
of
the
State_House
when
the
wind
was be%2:42:03::
right
,
and
used use%2:34:01::
Wilson
flat
above
Barre
when
it
was be%2:42:03::
n't
.
Between
the
unsafe
Towne
field
and
the
long
roundabout
back
road
haul
that
was be%2:42:03::
necessary
to
gain gain%2:40:03::
access
to
Wilson
flat
,
arrangements
at
the
state_capital
were be%2:42:03::
far
from
satisfactory
.
Each
time
in
,
the
unhappy
pilot
,
pushing push%2:32:01::
his
luck
,
begged beg%2:32:01::
the
postal
officials
that
met meet%2:38:01::
him
to
find find%2:40:00::
a
safer
landing_place
,
preferably
on
the
flat-topped
hills
across
the
Winooski_River
.
``
But
Fogg
''
,
they
countered counter%2:32:00::
,
``
we
can
n't
get_over get_over%2:38:00::
there
.
And
besides
you

to

here
''
.
It
took take%2:42:00::
a
tragedy
to
bring bring%2:35:04::
things
to
a
head
.
After
a
week
of
precarious
uphill
landings
and
downwind
takeoffs
,
Fogg
one_day
looked look%2:39:00::
down
at
the
shattered
yellow
wreckage
of
an
Army
plane
strewn strew%2:35:00::
across
snow-covered
Towne
field
.
Sent send%2:38:01::
to
Montpelier

had
been
killed kill%2:35:00::
,
and
his
pilot
,
Lt._Franklin_Wolfe
,
badly
injured injure%2:29:00::
.
With
the
field
a
blur
of
white
the
unfortunate
pilot
had
simply
flown fly%2:38:01::
into
the
hillside
.
Faced face%2:32:00::
with
this
situation
,
Postmaster_Charles_F._McKenna
of
Montpelier
went go%2:38:00::
with
Fogg
on
a
Burlington
trip
,
and
together
they
scouted scout%2:39:00::
the
terrain
on
the
heights
of
Berlin
.
A
long
flat
known
as
the
St._John
field
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
answer answer%2:32:00::
their
purpose
,
and
since
the
Winooski
bridges
were be%2:42:03::
at_last
passable
,
they
decided decide%2:31:00::
to
use use%2:34:01::
it
.
With
a
wary
eye
on
the
farmer
's
bull
,
Fred_Somers
of
Montpelier
and
Mr._St._John
marked mark%2:32:02::
the
field
with
a
red
table
cloth
.
As
a
wind
direction
indicator
,
they
tied tie%2:35:00::
a
cotton
rag
to
a
sapling
.
With
these
aids
,
and
a
pair
of
skiis
substituting substitute%2:40:00::
for
wheels
on
the
Waco
,
Bob_Fogg
made make%2:41:00::
the
first
landing
on
what
is be%2:42:03::
now
part
of
the
Barre-Montpelier_Airport
on
November
21
,
1927
.
Each
trip
saw see%2:39:02::
the
front
cockpit
filled fill%2:30:01::
higher
with
mail_pouches
.
During
the
second
week
of
operations
,
Fogg
received receive%2:40:00::
a
telegram
from
the
Post_Office_Department
,
asking ask%2:32:01::
him
to
``
put_on put_on%2:30:00::
two

''
.
Since
Fogg
's
was be%2:42:03::
a
one-man
,
one-plane
flying
service
,
this
meant mean%2:42:00::
that
he
would
have have%2:42:05::
to
do do%2:36:01::
both
trips
,
flying fly%2:38:01::
alone
600
miles
a
day
,
under
sub-freezing
temperature
conditions
.
Over
the
weeks
,
America
's
first
Star_Route
Air_Mail
settled settle%2:38:01::
into
a
routine
pattern
despite
the
vagaries
of
weather
and
the
lack
of
ground
facilities
and
aids
to
navigation
.
Each
morning
at
five
Fogg
crawled crawl%2:38:00::
out_of_bed
to
bundle bundle%2:35:00::
into
flying
togs
over
the
furnace
register
of
his
home
.
Always
troubled trouble%2:29:00::
by
poor
circulation
in
his
feet
,
he
experimented experiment%2:41:01::
with
various
combinations
of

before
finally
adopting adopt%2:40:00::
old-style
felt
farmer
's
boots
with
his
sheepskin
flying
boots
pulled pull%2:35:02::
over
them
.
A
sheep-lined
leather
flying
suit
,
plus
helmet
,
goggles
and
mittens
completed complete%2:30:02::
his
attire
for
the
rigors
of
the
open
cockpit
.
The
airman
's
stock
answer
to
``

?
became become%2:42:01::

!
As
daylight
began begin%2:30:00::
to
show show%2:39:02::
through
the
frosty

Fogg
would
place place%2:32:01::

could

by
a
visual
check
of
the
mountains

``

Out
at
the

each
morning
,
Fogg

Caleb_Marston
would

that
aviation
was be%2:42:03::

Bob_Fogg
always
made make%2:41:00::
a
point

each
morning
on
the
dot
of
seven
,
disregarding disregard%2:32:00::
rain

snow

in
true
postal
tradition
.
Concord
learned learn%2:31:00::
to
set set%2:30:02::
its
clocks
by
the
rackety
bark
of
the
Whirlwind
's

.
Sometimes
the
pilot
had_to
turn_back turn_back%2:30:00::
if
fully
blocked block%2:35:00::
by
fog
,
but
85
%
of
his
trips
were
completed complete%2:30:02::
.
Plane
radios
were be%2:42:03::
not_yet
available
,
and
once
in_the_air
,
Fogg
flew fly%2:35:00::
his
ship
by
compass
,
a
good
memory
for
landmarks
as
seen see%2:39:00::
from
above
,
and
a
capacity
for
dead_reckoning
and
quick
computation
.
Often
,
threading thread%2:38:00::
through
the
overcast
,
he
was
forced force%2:36:00::
to
fly fly%2:38:01::
close_to
the
ground
by
a
low
ceiling
,
skimming skim%2:35:00::
above
the
Winooski

the
White_River
along
the
line
of
the
broken
railroad
.
When
driving
rain
or
mist
socked sock%2:35:00::
in

valley
,
Fogg
would
chandelle chandelle%2:38:00::
up

from

The

It
ticked tick%2:39:00::

Sometimes

on

the

would
