The

in_theory
,
is be%2:42:03::
an
ingenious
adaptation
of
European
registration
systems
to
the
conditions
of
African
life
.
But
it
places place%2:35:00::
a
severe
strain
on
the
administrative
resources
(
already
burdened
in_other_ways
)
of
a
widely
dispersed
,
poor
and
largely
illiterate
population
.
The
sampling
program
was
instituted institute%2:36:01::
before
the
principles
of
probability
sampling
were
widely
recognized recognize%2:31:02::
in

studies
.
The
system
was be%2:42:03::
not
well
adapted
to
conditions
of
life
in
urban_centers

The
distinction
between
domiciled
(
de_jure
)
and
present
(
de_facto

population
was
not
clearly
defined define%2:42:00::
.
So
the
results
are be%2:42:03::
subject
to
considerable
confusion
.
The
system
tended tend%2:42:01::
to
break_down break_down%2:30:00::
during
the
war
,
but
was
reactivated reactivate%2:30:00::
;
it
had
reached reach%2:38:00::
the
pre-war
level
of
efficiency
by
1951
.
In_spite_of
the
defects
in_this
system
,
the
figures
on
total
population
during
the
late
1930
's
and
again
in
the
early
1950
's
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
have
represented represent%2:32:00::
actual
conditions
in
most
districts
with
approximate
fidelity
.
But
the
information
on
the
dynamics
of
population
was be%2:42:03::
often
quite
misleading
.
The
same
system
,
with
minor
modifications
,
was
developed develop%2:36:01::
in
Ruanda-Urundi
under
Belgian
administration
.
Here
again
it
seems seem%2:39:01::
that
useful
approximations

the
size
and
geographical
distribution
of
the
population
were
obtained obtain%2:40:00::
in_this_way
in

post-war

However
,
the
differences
in

fundamental

These
are be%2:42:03::
as_follows
:
Field

These

the

Sample

In_short
,
scientific

in_place

The
populations

Sample

Different

Higher
proportions
were

About

Uniform

Data
