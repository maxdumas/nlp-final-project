real_estate
salesman
,
Kern
first
got get%2:33:00::
seriously
interested interest%2:37:00::
in
the
problems
posed pose%2:42:00::
by
Communism
when
in

began begin%2:42:00::
reading read%2:31:01::
a_lot
about

there
was be%2:42:00::
anything
he
,
as

ideological
battle
and
set_out set_out%2:30:00::
to
do do%2:41:01::
it
.
The
best
approach
,
he
figured figure%2:31:02::
,
was be%2:42:07::
to
try try%2:41:00::
