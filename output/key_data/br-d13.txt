If
we
look look%2:39:00::
about
the
world
today
,
we
can
see see%2:39:00::
clearly
that
there
are be%2:42:00::
two
especially
significant
factors
shaping shape%2:31:00::
the
future
of
our
civilization
:
science
and
religion
.
Science
is
placing place%2:35:00::
in
our
hands
the
ultimate
power
of
the
universe
,
the
power
of
the
atom
.
Religion
,
or
the
lack
of_it
,
will
decide decide%2:31:01::
whether
we
use use%2:34:01::
this
power
to
build build%2:36:00::
a
brave
new_world
of
peace
and
abundance
for
all
mankind
,
or
whether
we
misuse misuse%2:34:00::
this
power
to
leave leave%2:42:02::
a
world
utterly
destroyed
.
How
can
we
have have%2:40:00::
the
wisdom
to
meet meet%2:41:02::
such
a
new
and
difficult
challenge
?
We
may
feel feel%2:37:00::
pessimistic
at
the
outlook
.
And
yet
there
is be%2:42:00::
a
note
of
hope
,
because
this
same
science
that_is
giving give%2:40:05::
us
the
power
of
the
atom
is
also
giving give%2:40:05::
us
atomic
vision
.
We
are
looking look%2:39:00::
inside
the
atom
and
seeing see%2:39:00::
there
a
universe
which
is be%2:42:06::
not
material
but
something
beyond
the
material
,
a
universe
that
in
a
word
is be%2:42:06::
not
matter
but
music
.
And
it
is be%2:42:05::
in_this
new
vision
of
the
atom
that
we
find find%2:40:02::
an
affirmation
and
an
invigoration
of
our
faith
.
To
see see%2:39:00::
this
vision
in
perspective
,
we
need need%2:42:00::
first_of_all
a
clear
idea
of
the
magnitude
of_this
new
power
from
the
atom
.
You
know know%2:31:01::
that
I
could
hold hold%2:35:00::
right
here
in
my
hand
the
little
chunk
of
uranium
metal
that
was be%2:42:03::
the
heart
of
the
bomb
that
dropped drop%2:38:00::
on
Hiroshima
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
only
about
the
size
of
a
baseball
;
but
packed pack%2:35:02::
in_that
metallic
ball
there
was be%2:42:00::
the
explosive
force
of
20000
tons
of
TNT
.
That
is be%2:42:03::
enough
TNT
to
fill fill%2:30:01::
the
tower
of
the
Empire_State
Building
;
and
with
the
availability
of
bombs
of_that
size
,
war
became become%2:42:01::
a
new
problem
.
Now
we
might
have
restricted restrict%2:30:02::
the
use
of
uranium
bombs
by
controlling control%2:41:01::
the
sources
of
uranium
because
it
is
found
in
only
a_few
places
in
the
world
.
But
we
had
hardly
started start%2:30:00::
to
adjust adjust%2:30:02::
our
thinking
to
this
new
uranium
weapon
when
we
were
faced face%2:32:00::
with
the
hydrogen_bomb
.
Hydrogen
is be%2:42:03::
just_as
plentiful
as
uranium
is be%2:42:03::
scarce
.
We
know know%2:31:01::
that
we
have have%2:40:00::
hydrogen
in
water
;
water
is be%2:42:03::
*
*
f
and
the
H
stands_for stand_for%2:32:01::
hydrogen
;
there
is be%2:42:00::
also
hydrogen
in
wood
and
hydrogen
in
our
bodies
.
I
have
calculated calculate%2:31:00::
that
if
I
could
snap snap%2:35:02::
my
fingers
in
one
magic
gesture
to
release release%2:35:00::
the
power
of
all
the
hydrogen
in
my
body
,
I
would
explode explode%2:30:01::
with
the
force
of
a_hundred
bombs
of
the
kind
that
fell fall%2:38:03::
on
Hiroshima
.
I
won
n't
try try%2:41:01::
the
experiment
,
but
I
think think%2:31:03::
you
can
see see%2:31:01::
that
if
we
all
knew know%2:31:01::
the
secret
and
we
could
all
let let_go%2:42:00::
ourselves
go
,
there
would
be be%2:42:04::
quite
an
explosion
.
And_then
think think%2:31:00::
how
little
hydrogen
we
have have%2:40:00::
in
us
compared compare%2:42:00::
with
the
hydrogen
in
Delaware_Bay
or
in
the
ocean
beyond
.
Salt
water
is be%2:42:03::
still
*
*
f
,
the
same
hydrogen
is
there
.
And
the
size
of
the
ocean
shows show%2:39:00::
us
the
magnitude
of
the
destructive
power
we
hold hold%2:40:00::;2:35:00::
in
our
hands
today
.
Of_course
,
there
is be%2:42:00::
also
an
optimistic
side
to
the
picture
.
For
if
I
knew know%2:31:01::
the
secret
of
letting let%2:41:00::
this
power
in
my
body
change change%2:30:00::
directly
into
electricity
,
I
could
rent rent_out%2:40:00::
myself
out
to
the
electric
companies
and
with
just
the
power
in
my
body
I
could
light light%2:30:00::
all
the
lights
and
run run%2:35:00::
all
the
factories
in
the
entire
United_States
for
some
days
.
And
think think%2:31:00::
,
if
we
all
knew know%2:31:01::
this
secret
and
we
could
pool pool%2:40:01::
our
power
,
what
a
wonderful
public_utility
company
we
would
make make%2:36:01::
.
With
just
the
hydrogen
of
our
bodies
,
we
could
run run%2:35:00::
the
world
for
years
.
Then
think think%2:31:00::
of
Delaware_Bay
and
the
ocean
and
you
see see%2:31:01::
that
we
have have%2:40:00::
a
supply
of
power
for
millions
of
years
to
come come%2:38:00::
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
power
with
which
we
can
literally
rebuild rebuild%2:36:00::
the
world
,
provide provide%2:40:00::
adequate
housing
,
food
,
education
,
abundant
living
for
everyone
everywhere
.
Now
let
us
see see%2:31:01::
where
this
power
comes come%2:42:04::
from
.
To
grasp grasp%2:31:00::
our
new
view
of
the
atom
,
we
have
to
appreciate appreciate%2:31:00::
first_of_all
how
small
the
atom
is be%2:42:03::
.
I
have
been
trying try%2:41:00::
to
make make%2:30:00::
this
clear
to
my
own
class
in
chemistry
.
One
night
there
were be%2:42:00::
some
dried
peas
lying lie%2:42:00::
on
our
kitchen_table
,
and
these
peas
looked look%2:39:01::
to
me
like
a_little
group
of
atoms
;
and
I
asked ask%2:32:00::
myself
a
question
:
Suppose suppose%2:32:00::
I
had have%2:40:00::
the
same
number
of
peas
as
there
are be%2:42:00::
atoms
in
my
body
,
how
large
an
area
would
they
cover cover%2:35:00::
?
I
calculated calculate%2:31:03::
first
that
there
are be%2:42:03::
about
an
octillion
atoms
in
the
average
human_body
;
that_is
a
figure
one
with
27
ciphers
,
quite
a
large_number
.
Then
I
calculated calculate%2:31:00::
that
a_million
peas
would
just_about
fill fill%2:30:01::
a
household
refrigerator
;
a_billion
peas
would
fill fill%2:30:01::
a
small
house
from
cellar
to
attic
;
a_trillion
peas
would
fill fill%2:30:01::
all
the
houses
in
a
town
of
about
ten_thousand
people
;
and
a
quadrillion
peas
would
fill fill%2:30:01::
all
the
buildings
in
the
city
of
Philadelphia
.
I
saw see%2:31:01::
that
I
would
soon
run_out run_out%2:30:12::
of
buildings
at
this
rate
,
so
I
decided decide%2:31:00::
to
take
another
measure
-
the
whole
state
of
Pennsylvania
.
Imagine imagine%2:36:00::
that
there
is be%2:42:04::
a
blizzard
over
Pennsylvania
,
but
instead
of
snowing snow%2:43:00::
snow
,
it
snows snow%2:43:00::
peas
;
so
we
get get%2:40:00::
the
whole
state
covered
with
peas
,
about
four
feet
deep
.
You
can
imagine imagine%2:36:00::
what
it
would
look_like look_like%2:42:00::
going go%2:38:00::
out
on
the
turnpike
with
the
peas
banked
up
against
the
houses
and
covering cover%2:35:00::
the
cars
;
Pennsylvania
thus
blanketed
would
contain contain%2:42:00::
about
a
quintillion
peas
.
But
we
still
have have%2:40:00::
a
long
way
to
go go%2:41:00::
.
Next
we
imagine imagine%2:36:00::
our
blizzard
raging rage%2:42:00::
over
all
the
land_areas
of
the
entire
globe
-
North_America
,
South_America
,
Europe
,
Asia
,
and
Africa
,
all
covered
with
peas
four
feet
deep
;
then
we
have have%2:40:00::
sextillion
peas
.
Next
we
freeze freeze%2:30:00::
over
the
oceans
and
cover cover%2:35:00::
the
whole
earth
with
peas
,
then
we
go go%2:38:00::
out
among
the
neighboring
stars
,
collect collect%2:35:00::
250
planets
each
the
size
of
the
earth
,
and
also
cover cover%2:35:00::
each
of
these
with
peas
four
feet
deep
;
and_then
we
have have%2:40:00::
septillion
.
Finally
we
go go%2:38:00::
into
the
farthest
reaches
of
the
Milky_Way
;
we
get get%2:30:03::
250000
planets
;
we
cover cover%2:35:00::
each
of
these
with
our
blanket
of
peas
and_then
at_last
we
have have%2:40:00::
octillion
peas
corresponding
in
number
to
the
atoms
in
the
body
.
So
you
see see%2:31:01::
how
small
an
atom
is be%2:42:03::
and_how
complicated
you
are be%2:42:03::
.
Now
although
an
atom
is be%2:42:03::
small
,
we
can
still
in
imagination
have_a_look have_a_look%2:39:00::
at
it
.
Let
us
focus focus%2:31:00::
on
an
atom
of
calcium
from
the
tip
of
the
bone
of
my
finger
and
let
us
suppose suppose%2:32:00::
that
I
swallow swallow%2:34:00::
a
magic
Alice
in
Wonderland
growing
pill
.
I
start start%2:30:00::
growing grow%2:30:00::
rapidly
and
this
calcium
atom
grows grow%2:30:00::
along
with
me
.
I
shoot_up shoot_up%2:30:00::
through
the
roof
,
into
the
sky
,
past
the
clouds
,
through
the
stratosphere
,
out
beyond
the
moon
,
out
among
the
planets
,
until
I
am be%2:42:03::
over
a_hundred
and
fifty
million
miles
long
.
Then
this
atom
of
calcium
will
swell swell%2:30:00::
to
something
like
a
great
balloon
a_hundred
yards
across
,
a
balloon
big
enough
to
put put%2:35:00::
a
football_field
inside
.
And
if
you
should
step step%2:38:00::
inside
of
such
a
magnified
atom
,
according
to
the
physics
of
forty
years
ago
,
you
would
see see%2:39:00::
circulating circulate%2:38:01::
over
your
head
,
down
at
the
sides
,
and
under
your
feet
,
some
twenty
luminous
balls
about
the
size
of
footballs
.
These
balls
are
moving move%2:38:00::
in
great_circles
and
ellipses
,
and
are be%2:42:03::
of_course
,
the
electrons
,
the
particles
of
negative
electricity
which
by
their
action
create create%2:36:00::
the
forces
that
tie tie%2:35:00::
this
atom
of
calcium
to
the
neighboring
atoms
of
oxygen
and
make_up make_up%2:42:00::
the
solid
structure
of
my
finger
bone
.
Since
these
electrons
are
moving move%2:38:01::
like
planets
,
you
may
wonder wonder%2:31:00::
whether
there
is be%2:42:00::
an
atomic
sun
at
the
center
of
the
atom
.
So
you
look look%2:39:00::
down
there
and
you
see see%2:39:00::
a
tiny
,
whirling
point
about
the
size
of
the
head
of
a
pin
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
the
atomic
sun
,
the
atomic
nucleus
.
Even
if
the
atom
were be%2:42:03::
big
enough
to
hold hold%2:35:01::
a
football_field
,
this
nucleus
is be%2:42:03::
still
only
about
the
size
of
a
pinhead
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
this
atomic
nucleus
that
contains contain%2:42:13::
the
positive_charge
of
electricity
holding hold%2:42:00::
these
negatively_charged
electrons
in
their
orbits
;
it
also
contains contain%2:42:13::
nearly
all
the
mass
,
and
the
atomic_energy
.
You
may
ask ask%2:32:00::
what
else
there
is be%2:42:00::
,
and
the
answer
is be%2:42:03::
nothing
-
nothing
but
empty
space
.
And
since
you
are be%2:42:03::
made
of
atoms
,
you
are be%2:42:03::
nothing
much
but
empty
space
,
too
.
If
I
could
put put%2:35:00::
your
body
in
an
imaginary
atomic
press
and
squeeze squeeze%2:35:05::
you
down
,
squeeze squeeze%2:35:05::
these
holes
out
of
you
in
the
way
we
squeeze squeeze%2:35:05::
the
holes
out
of
a
sponge
,
you
would
get get%2:30:00::
smaller
and
smaller
until
finally
when
the
last
hole
was be%2:42:03::
gone
,
you
would
be be%2:42:03::
smaller
than
the
smallest
speck
of
dust
that
you
could
see see%2:39:00::
on
this
piece_of_paper
.
Someone
has
remarked remark%2:32:00::
that
this
is be%2:42:03::
certainly
the
ultimate
in
reducing
.
At_any_rate
,
it
shows show%2:31:00::
us
how
immaterial
we
are be%2:42:03::
.
Now
this
1920
view
of
the
atom
was be%2:42:03::
on_the_whole
a
discouraging
picture
.
For
we
believed believe%2:31:00::
that
the
electrons
obeyed obey%2:41:00::
the
law
of
mechanics
and
electrodynamics
;
and
therefore
the
atom
was be%2:42:03::
really
just
a_little
machine
;
and
in
mechanics
the
whole
is be%2:42:07::
no_more_than
the
sum
of
the
parts
.
So
if
you
are be%2:42:03::
made
of
atoms
,
you
are be%2:42:03::
just
a
big
machine
;
and
since
the
universe
is
also
made make%2:36:08::
of
atoms
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
just
a
supermachine
.
And
this
would
mean mean%2:42:00::
that
we
live live%2:42:08::
in
a
mechanistic
universe
,
governed govern%2:41:02::
by
the
laws
of
cause
and
effect
,
bound bind%2:41:01::
in_chains
of
determinism
that
hold hold%2:42:00::
the
universe
on
a
completely
predetermined
course
in_which
there
is be%2:42:03::
not
room
for
soul
or
spirit
or
human
freedom
.
And
this
is be%2:42:06::
why
so
many
scientists
a
half
a
century
ago
were be%2:42:03::
agnostics
or
atheists
.
Then
came come%2:30:01::
the
scientific
revolution
in
the
late
1920
's
.
A
suggestion
from
Louis
de
Broglie
,
a
physicist
in
France
,
showed show%2:32:01::
us
that
these
electrons
are be%2:42:03::
not
point
particles
but
waves
.
And
to
see see%2:31:01::
the
meaning
of_this
new
picture
,
imagine imagine%2:36:00::
that
you
can
put_on put_on%2:29:00::
more
powerful
glasses
and
go_back go_back%2:38:00::
inside
the
atom
and
have_a_look have_a_look%2:39:00::
at
it
in
the
way
we
view view%2:31:00::
it
today
.
Now
as
you
step step%2:38:00::
inside
,
instead
of
seeing see%2:39:00::
particles
orbiting orbit%2:38:00::
around
like
planets
,
you
see see%2:39:00::
waves
and
ripples
very_much_like
the
ripples
that
you
get get%2:30:03::
on
the
surface
of
a
pond
when
you
drop drop%2:38:01::
a
stone
into
it
.
These
ripples
spread_out spread_out%2:38:00::
in
symmetrical
patterns
like
the
rose_windows
of
a
great
cathedral
.
And
as
the
waves
flow flow%2:38:01::
back_and_forth
and
merge merge%2:30:01::
with
the
waves
from
the
neighboring
atoms
,
you
can
put_on put_on%2:29:00::
a
magic
hearing_aid
and
you
hear hear%2:39:00::
music
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
a
music
like
the
music
from
a
great
organ
or
a
vast
orchestra
playing play%2:36:12::
a
symphony
.
Harmony
,
melody
