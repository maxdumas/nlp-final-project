control control%2:41:00::
the

significant
for

lines

Important
aspects
of
the
Kennedy
textile
plans
are be%2:42:06::
these
:
An
international
conference
of
the
big
textile-importing
and
textile-exporting
countries
will
be
called call%2:41:04::
shortly
by
President_Kennedy
.
Chief
aims
of
the
proposed
conference
are be%2:42:03::
worth
noting note%2:39:00::
.
The
U._S.
will
try try%2:41:00::
to
get get%2:40:00::
agreement
among
the
industrialized
countries
to
take take%2:40:02::
more
textile
imports
from
the
less-developed
countries
over
the
years
.
Point
is be%2:42:06::
that
developing
countries
often
build_up build_up%2:30:00::
a
textile
industry
first
,
need
encouragement
to
get get%2:30:00::
on
their
feet
.
If
they
have have%2:30:01::
trouble
exporting export%2:40:00::
,
international
bill
for
their
support
will
grow grow%2:30:00::
larger
than
it
otherwise
would
.
Idea
is be%2:42:06::
to
let let%2:41:00::
these
countries
earn earn%2:40:03::
their
way
as_much_as_possible
.
At_the_same_time
,
another
purpose
of
the
conference
will
be be%2:42:06::
to
get get%2:32:00::
certain
low-wage
countries
to
control control%2:41:01::
textile
exports
-
especially
dumping
of
specific
products
-
to
high-wage
textile-producing
countries
.
Japan
,
since
1957
,
has
been
``
voluntarily
''
curbing curb%2:41:00::
exports
of
textiles
to
the
U._S.
.
Hong_Kong
,
India
and
Pakistan
have
been
limiting limit%2:41:00::
exports
of
certain
types
of
textiles
to
Britain
for
several
years
under
the
``
Lancashire_Pact
''
.
None
of
these
countries
is be%2:42:03::
happy
with
these
arrangements
.
The
Japanese
want want%2:37:00::
to
increase increase%2:30:02::
exports
to
the
U._S.
While
they
have
been
curbing curb%2:41:00::
shipments
,
they
have
watched watch%2:41:00::
Hong_Kong
step_in step_in%2:41:00::
and
capture capture%2:40:00::
an
expanding
share
of
the
big
U._S.
market
.
Hong_Kong
interests
loudly
protest protest%2:41:00::
limiting limit%2:41:00::
their
exports
to
Britain
,
while
Spanish
and
Portuguese
textiles
pour pour%2:38:00::
into
British
market
unrestrictedly
.
The
Indians
and
Pakistanis
are
chafing chafe%2:39:00::
under
similar
restrictions
on
the_British
market
for
similar
reasons
.
The
Kennedy
hope
is be%2:42:06::
that
,
at
the
conference
or
through
bilateral
talks
,
the
low-wage
textile-producing
countries
in
Asia
and
Europe
will
see see%2:31:01::
that
``
dumping
''
practices
cause cause%2:36:00::
friction
all_around

may
result result%2:42:02::
in
import
quotas
.
Gradual
,
controlled
expansion
of
the
world
's
textile
trade
is be%2:42:06::
what
President_Kennedy
wants want%2:37:00::
.
This
may
point_the_way point_the_way%2:32:00::
toward
international
stabilization
agreements
in
other
products
.
It
's be%2:42:03::
an
important
clue
to
Washington
thinking
.
Note note%2:39:00::
,
too
,
that
the
Kennedy
textile
plan
looks look%2:39:00::
toward
modernization
or
shrinkage
of
the
U._S.
textile
industry
.
``
Get get%2:30:00::
competitive

get_out get_out%2:38:00::
