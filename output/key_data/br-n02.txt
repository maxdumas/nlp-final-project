was be%2:42:06::
the

Beneath

croaks

the

stared stare%2:39:00::

began begin%2:30:00::

looped loop%2:36:00::

.
Clayton
swung swing%2:38:02::
into
the
saddle
and
whacked whack%2:35:00::
the
stallion
's
rump
.
The
two
horses
broke break%2:38:02::
from
the
yard

from
the
circle
of
light
cast cast%2:36:02::
by
the
lamp
still
burning burn%2:43:01::
in
the
house

into
the
darkness

They
rode ride%2:38:01::
at
a
measured
pace
through
the
valley

Dawn
would
come come%2:38:04::
soon
and
the
night
was be%2:42:03::
at
its
coldest
.
The
moon
had
sunk sink%2:38:04::
below
the
black
crest
of
the
mountains
and
the
land
,
seen see%2:39:00::
through
eyes
that
had
grown grow%2:30:03::
accustomed_to
the
absence
of
light
,
looked look%2:39:01::
primeval
,
as
if
no
man
had
ever
trespassed trespass%2:41:01::
before

It
looked look%2:39:01::
as
Gavin
had
first
seen see%2:39:00::
it
years
ago
,
on
those
nights
when
he
slept sleep%2:29:00::
alone
by
his
campfire
and
waked wake%2:29:01::
suddenly
to
the
hoot
of
an
owl
or
the
rustle
of
a
blade
of
grass
in
the
moon
's
wind
-
a
savage
land
,
untenanted
and
brooding
,
too
strong
to
be
broken break%2:30:11::
by
the
will
of
men
.
Gavin
sighed sigh%2:29:00::
bitterly
.
In_that
inert
landscape
the
caravan
of
his
desires
passed pass%2:38:05::
before
his
mind
.
He
saw see%2:39:00::
them
ambushed ambush%2:33:01::
,
strewn strew%2:35:00::
in
the
postures
of
the
broken
and
the
dying
.
In_vain
his
mind
groped grope%2:41:00::
to
reassemble reassemble%2:36:00::
the
bones
of
the
relationships
he
had
sought seek%2:40:00::
so
desperately
,
but
they
would
not
come_to_life come_to_life%2:30:00::
.
The
silence
oppressed oppress%2:41:00::
him
,
made make%2:32:00::
him
bend bend%2:38:00::
low
over
the
horse
's
neck
as
if
to
hide hide%2:39:00::
from
a
wind
that
had
begun begin%2:30:00::
to
blow blow%2:43:00::
far
away
and
was
twisting twist%2:38:01::
slowly
through
the
darkness
in
its
slow
search
.
They
passed pass%2:38:05::
ranches
that
were
framed frame%2:35:00::
dark
gray
against
the
black
hills
.
Then
at_last
the
darkness
began begin%2:30:00::
to
dissolve dissolve%2:30:03::
.
A
bold
line
of
violet
broke_loose break_loose%2:38:00::
from
the
high
ridge
of
the
mountains
,
followed follow%2:38:00::
by
feathers
of
red
that
swept sweep%2:35:00::
the
last
stars
from
the
sky

The
wan
light
spread_over spread_over%2:35:00::
the
ground

the
valley
revealed reveal%2:39:00::
in
the
first
glimmer
the
contours

trees

fences

palely
shadowed
gullies

They
had
been

as
soon

left leave%2:38:01::
the
ranch

picked_out pick_out%2:39:00::

darkness

the
weary
though
watchful
eyes
of
two
men
posted post%2:41:01::
a_few
hundred
yards
away
in
the
windless
shelter
of
the
trees
.
The
two
men
whipped whip%2:35:00::
their
horses
into
town
and
flung fling%2:35:00::
themselves
up
the
steps
of
the
saloon
,
crying cry%2:32:02::
their
intelligence

The
men
in

were be%2:42:03::
tired
from
a
night

drinking

their
faces
red
and
baggy

But
the
liquor
had
flushed
their
courage

They
greeted greet%2:31:00::
the
news
angrily

as
though

had
been
cheated cheat%2:41:00::
of
purpose

Lester
heard hear%2:39:00::
their
muttering

saw see%2:39:00::

worked work%2:38:02::

round

Then
he
thought_of think_of%2:31:00::

Lester
's
hand
fluttered flutter%2:38:02::
to
Cabot

The

jerked jerk%2:38:00::
away

Cabot
turned turn%2:38:00::
back
to
the
men
and
he
was be%2:42:03::
drunk
with
the
thing
they
would
do do%2:36:01::
,
wild
to
break break%2:38:02::
from
the
cloying
warmth
of
the
saloon
into
the
cold
of
the
ebbing
night
.
He
fled flee%2:38:00::
through
the
door
and
down
the
steps
,
running run%2:38:00::
,
and
the
men
grunted grunt%2:32:00::
and
followed follow%2:38:00::
,
pushing push%2:38:00::
Lester
to
one
side
where
he
backed back%2:38:00::
against
the
wall
with
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
raised raise%2:38:00::
before
his
eyes
to
shut_out shut_out%2:41:00::
the
light

Purvis
and
Silas_Pettigrew
were be%2:42:03::
the
last
to
leave leave%2:38:01::
.
They
mounted_up mount_up%2:38:00::
and
rode ride%2:38:01::
slowly
behind
the
others
at
a
safe
distance
.
In
the
cold
dawn
the
mist
swirled swirl%2:38:00::
low
to
the
ground
,
then
rose rise%2:38:00::
with
a
gust
of
sudden
wind
to
leave leave%2:42:02::
the
valley
clear
.
The
clouds
parted part%2:38:02::
and
hard
gashes
of
sunlight
swooped swoop%2:38:00::
down
to
stain stain%2:30:00::
the
earth
with
streaks
of
white
and
gold
light
so_that
the
shadows
of
the
running
horses
flowed flow%2:38:01::
like
dark
streams
over
the
dazzling
snow
.
When
they
turned turn%2:38:00::
in
the
saddle
they
could
see see%2:39:00::
the
men
behind
them
,
strung_out string_out%2:35:00::
on
the
prairie
in
a
flat
black
line
.
The
wind
of
their
running
was be%2:42:03::
cold
and
wild
,
the
horses
were be%2:42:03::
lathered
and
their
manes
streamed stream%2:38:01::
like
stiff
black
pennants
in
the
wind
.
The
mare
began begin%2:30:00::
to
tire tire%2:29:01::
and
Clayton
felt feel%2:39:00::
the
spray
of
snow
from
the
hoofs
of
Gavin
's
stallion
.
He
looked look%2:39:00::
over
his
shoulder
at
the
thin
dotting
of
pursuers
.
They
neither
gained gain%2:33:00::
nor
fell_back fall_back%2:33:00::
.
He
rode ride%2:38:01::
low
on
the
mare
's
neck
.
Ahead
of
him
Gavin
turned turn%2:38:00::
slightly
off
the
trail
and
pointed point%2:38:05::
for
the
Gap
,
no_more_than
a
mile
away
.
Gavin
's
face
was be%2:42:03::
bloodless
with_excitement
.
He
did
not
look_back look_back%2:39:00::
;
he
could
feel feel%2:39:00::
more_than
hear hear%2:39:00::
the
staccato
beat
of
hoofs
that
fanned_out fan_out%2:38:00::
across
the
prairie
to_the_north
.
He
knew know%2:31:01::
who
was
riding ride%2:38:01::
after
him
-
the
men
he
had
known know%2:31:00::
all
his
life
,
the
men
who
had
worked work%2:41:00::
for
him
,
sworn swear%2:32:02::
their
loyalty
to
him
.
Now
they
were
riding ride%2:38:01::
to
kill kill%2:35:00::
him
.
And
he
was
fleeing flee%2:38:00::
,
running run%2:38:04::
-
fleeing flee%2:38:00::
his
death
and
his
life
at_the_same_time
.
The
land
over
which
he
sped speed%2:38:03::
was be%2:42:06::
the
land
he
had
created create%2:36:02::
and
lived live%2:42:08::
in
:
his
valley
.
With
every
leaping
stride
of
the
horse
beneath
him
he
crossed cross%2:38:00::
one
more
patch
of
earth
that
had
been be%2:42:06::
his
,
that
he
would
never
see see%2:39:00::
again
.
The
Gap
looming loom%2:42:00::
before
him
-
the
place
where
had
confronted confront%2:33:00::
Jack_English
on_that
day
so
many
years
ago
-
was be%2:42:06::
his
exit
from
all
that
had have%2:40:00::
meaning
to
him
.
California
is be%2:42:03::
too
far
,
he
thought think%2:31:01::
.
He
would
never
reach reach%2:38:01::
California
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
too
old
-
when
he
passed pass%2:38:05::
up
and
through
the
corridor
of
pines
that
lined line%2:42:00::
the
trail
he
could
see see%2:39:00::
ahead
,
he
was
passing pass%2:38:02::
from
life
.
