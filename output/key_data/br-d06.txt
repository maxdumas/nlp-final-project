I
have
,
within
the
past
fifty
years
,
come_out come_out%2:30:04::
of
all
uncertainty
into
a
faith
which
is be%2:42:03::
a
dominating
conviction
of
the
Truth
and
about
which
I
have have%2:39:06::
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
.
It
has
been be%2:42:06::
my
lot
all
through
life
to
associate associate%2:41:02::
with
eminent
scientists
and
at_times
to
discuss discuss%2:32:00::
with
them
the
deepest
and
most
vital
of
all
questions
,
the
nature
of
the
hope
of
a
life
beyond
this
.
I
have
also
constantly
engaged engage%2:41:06::
in
scientific
work
and
am be%2:42:03::
fully
aware_of
the
value
of
opinions
formed form%2:35:00::
in
science
as_well
as
in
the
religions
in
the
world
.
n
an
amateu6rish
,
yet
in
a
very
real
sense
,
I
have
followed follow%2:30:01::
the
developments
of
archaeology
,
geology
,
astronomy
,
herpetology
,
and
mycology
with
a
hearty
appreciation
of
the
advances
being
made make%2:36:00::
in
these
fields
.
At_one_time
I
became become%2:30:00::
disturbed
in
the
faith
in_which
I
had
grown_up grow_up%2:41:00::
by
the
apparent
inroads
being
made make%2:36:00::
upon
both
Old
and
New_Testaments
by
a
``
Higher_Criticism
''
of
the
Bible
,
to
refute refute%2:32:00::
which
I
felt feel%2:37:00::
the
need
of
a
better
knowledge
of
Hebrew
and
of
archaeology
,
for
it
seemed seem%2:39:01::
to
me
that
to
pull_out pull_out%2:38:03::
some
of
the
props
of
our
faith
was be%2:42:06::
to
weaken weaken%2:30:01::
the
entire
structure
.
Doubts
thus
inculcated inculcate%2:31:00::
left leave%2:42:02::
me
floundering flounder%2:41:00::
for_a_while
and
,
like
some
higher
critical
friends
,
trying try%2:41:00::
to
continue continue%2:42:01::
to
use use%2:34:01::
the
Bible
as
the
Word_of_God
while
at_the_same_time
holding hold%2:31:08::
it
to
have
been
subjected subject%2:33:00::
to
a
vast
number
of
redactions
and
interpolations
:
attempting attempt%2:41:00::
to
bridge bridge%2:42:00::
the
chasm
between
an
older
,
reverent
,
Bible-loving
generation
and
a
critical
,
doubting
,
Bible-emancipated
race
.
Although
still
aware_of
a
great
light
and
glow
of
warmth
in
the
Book
,
I
stood stand%2:42:04::
outside
shivering shiver%2:38:00::
in
the
cold
.
In
one
thing
the
higher
critics
,
like
the
modernists
,
however
,
overreached overreach%2:41:00::
themselves
,
in
claiming claim%2:32:00::
that
the
Gospel
of
John
was
not
written write%2:36:00::
in
John
's
time
but
well
after
the
first
century
,
perhaps
as
late
as
150
A._D.
.
Now
,
if
any
part
of
the
Bible
is be%2:42:06::
assuredly
the
very
Word_of_God
speaking speak%2:32:00::
through
His
servant
,
it
is be%2:42:06::
John
's
Gospel
.
To
ask ask%2:32:05::
me
to
believe believe%2:31:00::
that
so
inexpressibly
marvelous
a
book
was
written write%2:36:00::
long
after_all
the
events
by
some
admiring
follower
,
and
was
not
inspired inspire%2:36:00::
directly
by
the
Spirit
of
God
,
is
asking ask%2:32:01::
me
to
accept accept%2:31:00::
a
miracle
far
greater
than
any
of
those
recorded record%2:32:00::
in
the
Bible
.
Here
I
took take_leave%2:38:00::
my
leave
of
my
learned
friends
to
step step%2:38:00::
out
on
another
path
,
to_which
we
might
give give%2:40:03::
the
modern
name
of
Pragmatism
,
or
the
thing
that
works work%2:41:03::
.
Test
it
,
try
it
,
and
if
it
works work%2:41:03::
,
accept
it
as
a
guiding
principle
.
So
,
I
put put%2:35:05::
my
Bible
to
the
practical
test
of
noting note%2:39:00::
what
it
says say%2:32:00::
about
itself
,
and_then
tested test%2:41:00::
it
to
see see%2:39:04::
how
it
worked work%2:41:03::
.
As
a
short
,
possibly
not
the
best
method
,
I
looked_up look_up%2:32:00::
``
Word
''
in
the
Concordance
and
noted note%2:39:00::
that
the
Bible
claims claim%2:32:00::
from
Genesis
1
to
Revelation
22
to
be be%2:42:06::
God
's
personal
message
to
man
.
The
next
traditional
step
then
was be%2:42:06::
to
accept accept%2:31:00::
it
as
the
authoritative
textbook
of
the
Christian
faith
just_as
one
would
accept accept%2:31:00::
a
treatise
on
any
earthly
``
science
''
,
and
I
submitted submit%2:33:00::
to
its
conditions
according accord%2:42:00::
to
Christ
's
invitation
and
promise
that
,
``
If
any
man
will
do do%2:41:01::
his
will
,
he
shall
know know%2:31:01::
of
the
doctrine
,
whether
it
be be%2:42:03::
of
God
,
or
whether
I
speak speak%2:32:00::
of
myself
''
(
John
7
:
17
)
.
The
outcome
of
such
an
experiment
has
been be%2:42:06::
in_due_time
the
acceptance
of
the
Bible
as
the
Word_of_God
inspired inspire%2:32:00::
in_a_sense
utterly
different
from
any
merely
human
book
,
and
with_it
the
acceptance
of
our
Lord
Jesus_Christ
as
the
only
begotten
Son
of
God
,
Son
of
Man
by
the_Virgin
Mary
,
the
Saviour
of
the
world
.
I
believe believe%2:31:00::
,
therefore
,
that
we
are be%2:42:03::
without
exception
sinners
,
by
nature
alienated alienate%2:37:00::
from
God
,
and
that
Jesus_Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
,
came come%2:38:04::
to
earth
,
the
representative
Head
of
a
new
race
,
to
die die%2:30:00::
upon
the
cross
and
pay pay%2:40:00::
the
penalty
of
the
sin
of
the
world
,
and
that
he
who
thus
receives receive%2:31:00::
Christ
as
his
personal
Saviour
is
``
born bear%2:29:01::
again
''
spiritually
,
with
new
privileges
,
appetites
,
and
affections
,
destined destine%2:31:00::
to
live live%2:42:00::
and
grow grow%2:30:02::
in
His
likeness
forever
.
Nor
can
any
man
save save%2:41:02::
himself
by
good
works
or
by
a
commendable
``
moral
life
''
,
although
such
works
are be%2:42:03::
the
natural
fruits
and
evidences
of
a
saving
faith
already
received receive%2:31:00::
and
naturally
expressing express%2:32:01::
itself
through
such
avenues
.
I
now
ever
look_for look_for%2:37:00::
Christ
acording
to
His
promises
and
those
of
the
Old_Testament
as_well
,
to

all

to
reign reign%2:41:00::
in

over

.
To
state state%2:32:00::
fully
what
the
Bible
means mean%2:42:03::
as
my
daily
spiritual
food
is be%2:42:03::

Our
Lord
's
invitation
with
its
implied
promise
to
all
is be%2:42:06::
,
``
Come
and
see
''
.
I
stood stand%2:35:00::
at
the
bedside
of
my
patient
one_day
and
beheld behold%2:39:00::
a
very
sick
man
in
terrible
pain
.
As
I
ministered minister%2:41:12::
to
his
needs
,
I
noticed notice%2:39:04::
that
his
face
was be%2:42:03::
radiant
in_spite_of
his
suffering
and
I
learned learn%2:31:01::
that
he
was
trusting trust%2:31:00::
not_only
in
the
skill
of
his
doctor
and
nurse
but
also
the
Lord
.
In
his
heart
he
had have%2:40:00::
that
peace
of_which
the
Lord
spoke speak%2:32:00::
when
He
said say%2:32:00::
,
``

.
What
a
joy
to
realize realize%2:31:00::
that
we
,
too
,
can
claim claim%2:40:00::
this
promise
tendered tender%2:40:01::
by
the
Lord
during
His
earthly
ministry
to
a
group
of
men
who
were be%2:42:03::
very
dear
to
Him
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
about
to
leave leave%2:31:05::
them
,
to
depart depart%2:38:00::
from

return return%2:38:00::
to
His
Father
in
Heaven

Before
He
left leave%2:31:05::

He
promised promise%2:32:00::
that
His
peace
would
be be%2:42:06::
their
portion

in
their
hearts

I
praise praise%2:32:00::
God
for
the
privilege
of
being be%2:41:00::
a
nurse
who
has have%2:40:00::
that
peace
through
faith
in
the
Lord
Jesus_Christ
.
It
makes make%2:30:00::
my
work
a
great_deal
easier

be be%2:42:03::
able

pray pray%2:32:00::
for

Lord
's
guidance
while
ministering minister%2:41:12::

How
often
have
I
looked_to look_to%2:31:00::
Jesus
when
entering enter%2:38:00::
the
sick
room
,
asking ask%2:32:01::
for
His
presence

help
in
my
professional
duties

I
give give%2:32:03::
my
talents
not_only
as
the
world
giveth
but
as
one
who
loves love%2:37:00::
the
Saviour
and
His
creatures
.
Looking
unto
God
,
the
Prophet_Isaiah
wrote write%2:36:00::
these
blessed
words
almost
three
thousand
years

:
``
