me
,
mechanisms
of
adaptation
and
defense
that
are be%2:42:03::
just
too
complete
and
too
satisfactory
.
Mollusks
are be%2:42:07::
a
case_in_point
.
The
shell
,
which
served serve%2:42:03::
the
strain
so
well
at
a
relatively
early
stage
in
the
evolutionary
scheme
,
tended tend%2:42:01::
to
cancel_out cancel_out%2:30:00::
the
possibility
of
future
development
.
Though
this
may
or
may_not
be be%2:42:03::
good
biology
,
it
does
aptly
illustrate illustrate%2:32:00::
the
strength
and
the
weakness
of
American_Catholic
higher
education
.
There
can
be be%2:42:00::
no_doubt
that
the
American_Catholic
accomplishment
in
the
field
of
higher
education
is be%2:42:03::
most
impressive
:
our
European
brethren
never
cease cease%2:42:00::
to
marvel marvel%2:32:12::
at
the
number
and
the
size
of
our
colleges
and
universities
.
The
deeper
wonder
is be%2:42:07::
how
this
miracle
was
accomplished accomplish%2:36:00::
in
decades
,
rather_than
in
centuries
and
by
immigrant
minorities
at
that
.
By
way
of
explanation
we
ourselves
are be%2:42:03::
prone
to
imagine imagine%2:31:01::
that
this
achievement
stems stem%2:42:00::
from
the
same
American_Catholic
zeal
and
generosity
which
brought bring%2:36:00::
the
parochial_school
system
into
existence
.
There
is be%2:42:00::
,
however
,
one
curious
discrepancy
in_this
broad
and
flattering
picture
.
Viewing view%2:31:00::
the
American_Catholic
educational
achievement
in
retrospect
,
we
may
indeed
see see%2:31:00::
it
as
a
unified
whole
extending extend%2:42:01::
from
grade_school
to
university
.
But
the
simple
truth
is be%2:42:07::
that
higher
education
has
never
really
been be%2:42:07::
an
official
American_Catholic
project
;
certainly
not
in
the
same
sense
that
the
establishment
of
a
parochial_school
system
has
been be%2:42:07::
a
matter
of
official
policy
.
Official
encouragement
is be%2:42:07::
one
thing
,
but
the
down-to-earth
test
is be%2:42:07::
the
allocation
of
diocesan
and
parochial
funds
.
American_Catholics
have
responded respond%2:31:00::
generously
to
bishops
'
and
pastors
'
appeals
for
the
support
necessary
to
create create%2:36:00::
parochial_schools
but
they
have
not
contributed contribute%2:40:02::
in
a
similar
fashion
to
the
establishment
of
institutions
of
higher
learning
.
They
have
not
done do%2:41:04::
so
for
the
simple
reason
that
such
appeals
have
hardly
ever
been
made make%2:41:00::
.
Diocesan
authorities
generally
have
not
regarded regard%2:31:00::
this
as
their
direct
responsibility
.
All_of
this
may
be be%2:42:03::
understandable
enough
:
it
is be%2:42:03::
,
however
,
in_fact
difficult
to
see see%2:31:01::
how
diocesan
authorities
could
have
acted act%2:41:00::
otherwise
.
Yet
for
better
or
for
worse
,
the
truth
of
the_matter
is be%2:42:07::
that
most
American_Catholic
colleges
do
not
owe owe%2:40:01::
their
existence
to
general
Catholic
support
but
rather
to
the
initiative
,
resourcefulness
and
sacrifices
of
individual
religious
communities
.
Community
esprit_de_corps
has
been be%2:42:07::
the
protective
shell
which
has
made make%2:30:00::
the
achievement
possible
.
To
understand understand%2:31:00::
the
past
history
-
and
the
future
potential
-
of
American_Catholic
higher
education
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
necessary
to
appreciate appreciate%2:31:00::
the
special
character
of
the
esprit
d
'
corps
of
the
religious
community
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
something
more_than
the
arithmetical
sum
of
individual
totals
of
piety
and
detachment
.
A
religious
community
with
a
vital
sense
of
mission
achieves achieve%2:41:00::
a
degree
of
group
orientation
and
group
identification
seldom
found find%2:40:02::
elsewhere
.
The
fact
that
the
group
orientation
and
group
identification
are_founded
on
supernatural
principles
and
nourished nourish%2:34:00::
by
the
well-springs
of
devotion
simply
give give%2:40:03::
them
a
deeper
and
more
satisfying
dimension
.
The
net
result
is be%2:42:07::
a
uniquely
satisfying
sense
of
comradeship
,
the
kind_of
comradeship
which
sparks spark%2:36:00::
enthusiasm
and
blunts blunt%2:30:01::
the
cutting_edge
of
sacrifice
and
hardship
.
American_Catholic
colleges
and
universities
are be%2:42:07::
,
in
a
very
real
sense
,
the
product
of
``
private
enterprise
''
-
the
``
private
enterprise
''
of
religious
communities
.
Had
it
not
been
for
such
private
enterprise
,
diocesan
authorities
might
of_course
have
been
goaded goad%2:37:00::
into
establishing establish%2:41:00::
institutions
subsidized subsidize%2:40:00::
by
diocesan
funds
and
parish
collections
and
staffed staff%2:33:00::
by
religious
as
paid
employees
.
There
is be%2:42:00::
however
no
point
in
speculating speculate%2:32:00::
about
such
a
possibility
:
the
fact
of
the_matter
is be%2:42:07::
that
our
institutions
of
higher
learning
owe owe%2:40:01::
their
existence
to
a
spirit
not
unlike
that
which
produces produce%2:36:02::
the
``
family
business
''
.
This
``
family-community
''
spirit
is be%2:42:07::
the
real
explanation
of
the
marvel
of
our
achievement
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
this
spirit
which
explains explain%2:32:00::
some
of
the
anomalies
of
American_Catholic
higher
education
,
in_particular
the
wasteful
duplication
apparent
in
some
areas
.
I
think think%2:31:02::
for_example
of
three
women
's
colleges
with
pitifully
small
enrollments
,
clustered cluster%2:35:00::
within
a_few
miles
of
a
major
Catholic
university
,
which
is be%2:42:03::
also
co-educational
.
This
is be%2:42:03::
not
an
isolated
example
;
this
aspect
of
the
total
picture
has
been
commented comment%2:32:00::
upon
often
enough
.
It
would
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
represent represent%2:42:01::
esprit_de_corps
run
riot
.
Apart
,
however
,
from
the
question
of
wasteful
duplication
,
there
is be%2:42:00::
another
aspect
of
the
``
family
business
''
spirit
in
American_Catholic
higher
education
which
deserves deserve%2:42:00::
closer
scrutiny
.
For
while
the
past
needs
of
the
Church
in_this
country
may
have
been
adequately
met meet%2:42:01::
by
collegiate
institutions
,
which
in
temper
and
tone
closely
resembled resemble%2:42:00::
junior_colleges
and
finishing
schools
,
it
would
seem seem%2:39:01::
that
today
's
need
is be%2:42:03::
for
the
college
which
more
closely
resembles resemble%2:42:00::
the
university
in
its
``
pursuit
of
excellence
''
.
At
the
earlier
``
pre-academic
excellence
''
stage
of
Catholic
education
,
the
operation
could
be
conducted conduct%2:41:00::
on
an
intra-mural
community
basis
.
But
with
today
's
demand
for
professional
qualifications
and
specialized
training
,
the
need
for
``
outsiders
''
become become%2:30:00::
more
pressing
.
The
problem
is be%2:42:07::
not
merely
that
more
``
outside
teachers
''
are be%2:42:03::
needed
but
that
a
different
brand
is
called_for call_for%2:42:00::
.
Commenting comment%2:32:00::
on
the
earlier
stage
,
the
Notre_Dame
Chapter
of
the
American_Association
of
University_Professors
(
in
a
recent
report
on
the
question
of
faculty
participation
in
administrative
decision-making
)
noted note%2:32:00::
that
the
term
``
teacher-employee
''
(
as
opposed oppose%2:42:00::
to
,
e._g.
,
``
maintenance
employee
''
)
was be%2:42:03::
a
not
inapt
description
.
Today
however
,
the
``
outsider
''
is be%2:42:03::
likely
to
have have%2:40:00::
professional
qualifications
of
the
highest
order
(
otherwise
the
college
would
not
be be%2:42:03::
interested
in
hiring hire%2:41:00::
him
)
and
to
be
acclimatized acclimatize%2:30:00::
to
the
democratic
processes
of
the
secular
or
state
university
.
And
while
no
one
expects expect%2:31:00::
total
democracy
on
the
academic
scene
,
the
scholar
will
be be%2:42:03::
particularly
sensitive
to
a
line

first
and
second_class

any

In
the
above
mentioned mention%2:32:02::
report
of
the
Notre_Dame

the
American_Association

,
the
basic
outlook

the
new
breed

emerges emerge%2:30:00::
very
clearly
in
the
very
statement
of
the
problem
as
the
members
see see%2:31:00::
it
:
``
Even
with

inhomogeneous

of
extremely
varying

It

(
to
use use%2:34:01::
that
oft-repeated
phrase
)
'
the
attainment
of
excellence

'
.
The
pattern
here
pictured picture%2:36:00::
is be%2:42:03::
clearly
not
peculiar_to
Notre_Dame
:
it
is be%2:42:03::
simply
that
the
paradox
involved involve%2:42:00::
in_this
kind_of
control
of
the
institution
by
``
the

actually

it
,
becomes become%2:30:00::
more
obvious
where
there
is be%2:42:00::
a
larger
and
more
distinguished
``
outside

faculty
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
particularly
interesting
that
those
who
framed frame%2:31:00::
the
report
should
refer refer%2:32:12::
to
``
the

:
this

to

an
awareness
of
the
fact
that
there
is be%2:42:00::
more
to

two

with
this

fatal
to
the
future

In_the_first_place
there

the
obvious
problem
of
recruiting recruit%2:33:00::
high

Word

rapidly

the

Expressions
of
even
low-key
dissatisfaction
by
a
Catholic
college
faculty_member
has have%2:40:00::
the
effect
of
confirming confirm%2:31:00::
the
already
existing
stereotype
.
In

academic
world
there
is be%2:42:00::
seldom
anything
so
dramatic
as
a
strike
or
a
boycott
:
all
that
happens happen%2:30:01::
is be%2:42:07::
that
the
better

declines
to
gamble gamble%2:41:00::
two
or
three
years
of
his
life
on
the
chance
that
conditions
at
the
Catholic
institution
will
be be%2:42:03::
as_good_as
those
elsewhere
.
To
appreciate appreciate%2:31:00::
the
nature
of
the
gamble
,
it
should
be
realized realize%2:31:00::
that
while
college
teaching
is be%2:42:03::
almost
a
public
symbol
of
security
,
that
security
does
not
come come%2:38:04::
as
quickly
or
as
automatically
as
it
does
in
an
elementary_school
system
or
in
the
Civil_Service

Much
has
been
made make%2:36:08::
of
the
fact
that
major
Catholic
institutions
now
guarantee guarantee%2:32:00::
firm
tenure
.
This
is be%2:42:03::
a
significant
advance
but
its
import
should
not
be
exaggerated exaggerate%2:32:00::
.
When
a
man
invests invest%2:40:00::
a
block
of
his
years
at
a
university
without
gaining gain%2:40:03::
the
coveted
promotion
,
not_only
is
he
faced face%2:32:00::
with
the
problem
of
starting start%2:30:00::
over
but
there
is be%2:42:00::
also
a
certain
depreciation
in
the
market_value
of
his
services
.
A
man
does
not
make make%2:41:00::
that
kind_of
gamble
if
he
suspects suspect%2:31:02::
that
one
or
more
of
the
limited
number
of
tenure
positions
is
being
reserved reserve%2:40:03::
for
members
of
the
``
family

Just_as
it
is be%2:42:03::
possible
to
exaggerate exaggerate%2:32:00::
the
drawing draw%2:37:01::
power
of
the
new
tenure
practices
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
also
possible
to
exaggerate exaggerate%2:32:00::
the
significance
of
the
now
relatively
adequate
salaries
paid pay%2:40:00::
by
major
Catholic
institutions
.
Adequate
compensation
is be%2:42:03::
indispensable
.
Yet
adequate
compensation
-
and
particularly
merely
adequate
compensation
is be%2:42:03::
no
substitute
for
those
intangibles
which
cause cause%2:32:00::
a
man
to
sacrifice sacrifice%2:40:00::
part
of
his
earning earn%2:40:01::
potential
by
taking_up take_up%2:41:01::
college
teaching
in_the_first_place
.
Broadly
speaking speak%2:32:00::
the
total
Catholic
atmosphere
is be%2:42:03::
such
an
intangible
but
the
larger
demand
is be%2:42:07::
for
a
sense
of
creative
participation
and
mature
responsibility
in
the
total
work
of
the
university
.
Religious
who
derive derive%2:40:00::
their
own
sense
of
purpose
through
identification
with
the
religious
community
rather_than
the
academic
community
are be%2:42:03::
prone
to
underestimate underestimate%2:31:01::
both
the
layman
's
reservoir
of
idealism
and
his
need
for
this
identification
.
There
is be%2:42:00::
no
need
here
to
spell_out spell_out%2:32:00::
the
conditions
of
creative
teaching
except
to
point_out point_out%2:32:01::
that
,
at
the
college_level
,
the
sense
of
community
and
of
community
responsibility
is be%2:42:03::
even
more
necessary
than
it
is be%2:42:03::
at
other
levels
.
The
college
teacher
needs need%2:42:00::
the
stimulus
of
communication
with
other
faculty_members
but
he
also
needs need%2:34:00::
to
feel feel%2:31:00::
that
such
communication
,
even
informal
debates
over
the
luncheon
table
,
are be%2:42:03::
a
contribution
to
the
total
good
of
the
institution
.
But
this
in_turn
means mean%2:42:00::
that
decisions
are
not
merely
imposed impose%2:41:00::
from
the
top
but
that
there
be be%2:42:00::
some
actual
mechanism
of
faculty
participation
.
The
second
reason
for
being be%2:42:03::
concerned
with
the
dichotomy
between
faculty_members
who
are be%2:42:03::
part
of
the
``
in-group
''
that
owns own%2:40:00::
and
operates operate%2:41:00::
the
institution
and
those
who
are be%2:42:03::
merely
paid
employees
,
is be%2:42:07::
,
therefore
,
the
baneful
effect
on
the
caliber
of
the
teaching
itself
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
a
problem
that
goes go%2:42:00::
considerably
beyond
questions
of
salary
and
tenure
.
Yet
though
it
may
seem seem%2:39:00::
difficult
to
envision envision%2:36:00::
any
definitive
resolution
of
the
problem
of
ownership
and
control
,
there
are be%2:42:00::
nevertheless
certain
suggestions
which
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
in_order
.
The
first
is be%2:42:06::
a
negative
warning
:
there
is be%2:42:00::
no
point
in
the
creation
of
faculty
committees
and
advisory_boards
with
high-sounding
titles
but
no
real
authority
.
In
the
case
of
