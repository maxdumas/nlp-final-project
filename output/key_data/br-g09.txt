Another
element
to
concern concern%2:42:01::
the
choreographer
is be%2:42:06::
that
of
the
visual
devices
of
the
theatre
.
Most
avant-garde
creators
,
true_to
their
interest
in
the
self-sufficiency
of
pure
movement
,
have
tended tend%2:42:01::
to
dress dress%2:29:01::
their
dancers
in
simple
lines
and
solid
colors
(
often
black
)
and
to
give give%2:40:03::
them
a
bare
cyclorama
for
a
setting
.
But
Robert_Rauschenberg
,
the
neo-dadaist
artist
,
has
collaborated collaborate%2:41:00::
with
several
of
them
.
He
has
designed design%2:36:01::
a
matching
backdrop
and
costumes
of
points
of
color
on
white
for
Mr._Cunningham
's
Summerspace
,
so_that
dancers
and
background
merge merge%2:30:01::
into
a
shimmering
unity
.
For
Mr._Taylor
's
Images
and
Reflections
he
made make%2:36:09::
some
diaphanous
tents
that
alternately
hide hide%2:39:00::
and
reveal reveal%2:39:00::
the
performer
,
and
a
girl
's
cape
lined line%2:35:00::
with
grass
.
Mr._Nikolais
has
made make%2:36:00::
a
distinctive
contribution
to
the
arts
of
costume
and
decor
.
In_fact
,
he
calls call%2:32:02::
his
productions
dance-theatre
works
of
motion
,
shape
,
light
,
and
sound
.
To
raise raise%2:30:02::
the
dancer
out
of
his
personal
,
pedestrian
self
,
Mr._Nikolais
has
experimented experiment%2:41:01::
with
relating relate%2:31:00::
him
to
a
larger
,
environmental
orbit
.
He
began begin%2:30:00::
with
masks
to
make make%2:32:00::
the
dancer
identify identify%2:31:04::
himself
with
the
creature
he
appeared appear%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
.
He
went_on go_on%2:30:00::
to
use use%2:34:01::
objects
-
hoops
,
poles
,
capes
-
which
he
employed employ%2:34:00::
as
extensions
of
the
body
of
the
dancer
,
who
moved move%2:29:06::
with
them
.
The
depersonalization
continued continue%2:42:01::
as
the
dancer
was
further
metamorphosed metamorphose%2:30:00::
by
the
play
of
lights
upon
his
figure
.
In
each
case
,
the
object
,
the
color
,
even
the
percussive
sounds
of
the
electronic
score
were
designed design%2:36:02::
to
become become%2:30:00::
part
of
the
theatrical
being
of
the
performer
.
The
dancer
who
never
loosens loosen%2:30:01::
her
hold
on
a
parasol
,
begins begin%2:30:00::
to
feel feel%2:31:00::
that
it
is be%2:42:03::
part
of
herself
.
Or
,
clad
from_head_to_toe
in
fabric
stretched stretch%2:30:00::
over
a
series
of
hoops
,
the
performer
may
well
lose lose%2:40:02::
his
sense
of
self
in
being be%2:42:06::
a
``
finial
''
.
As
the
dancer
is
depersonalized depersonalize%2:30:00::
,
his
accouterments
are
animized animize%2:30:00::
,
and
the
combined
elements
give_birth_to
a
new
being
.
From
this
being
come come%2:30:01::
new
movement
ideas
that
utilize utilize%2:34:00::
dancer
and
property
as
a
single
unit
.
Thus
,
the
avant-garde
choreographers
have
extended extend%2:30:01::
the
scope
of
materials
available
for
dance
composition
.
But
,
since
they
have
rejected reject%2:31:00::
both
narrative
and
emotional
continuity
,
how
are
they
to
unify unify%2:35:00::
the
impressive
array
of
materials
at
their
disposal
?
Some
look look_to%2:31:00::
deliberately
to
devices
used use%2:34:01::
by
creators
in
the
other
arts
and
apply apply%2:34:00::
corresponding
methods
to
their
own
work
.
Others
,
less
consciously
but
quite
probably
influenced influence%2:41:00::
by
the
trends
of
the
times
,
experiment experiment%2:41:01::
with
approaches
that
parallel parallel%2:42:00::
those
of
the
contemporary
poet
,
painter
,
and
musician
.
An
approach
that
has
appealed appeal%2:37:00::
to
some
choreographers
is be%2:42:03::
reminiscent_of
Charles_Olson
's
statement
of
the
process
of
projective
verse
:
``
one
perception
must
immediately
and
directly
lead lead%2:41:12::;2:42:12::
to
a
further
perception
''
.
The
creator
trusts trust%2:41:00::
his
intuition
to
lead lead%2:38:01::
him
along
a
path
that
has have%2:42:00::
internal
validity
because
it
mirrors mirror%2:43:00::
the
reality
of
his
experience
.
He
disdains disdain%2:37:00::
external
restrictions
-
conventional
syntax
,
traditional
metre
.
The
unit
of
form
is
determined determine%2:31:02::
subjectively
:
``
the
Heart
,
by_the_way
of
the
Breath
,
to
the
Line
''
.
The
test
of
form
is be%2:42:06::
fidelity
to
the
experience
,
a
gauge
also
accepted accept%2:31:01::
by
the
abstract
expressionist
painters
.
An
earlier
but
still
influential
school
of
painting
,
surrealism
,
had
suggested suggest%2:32:02::
the
way
of
dealing deal%2:32:08::
with
the
dream
experience
,
that
event
in_which
seemingly
incongruous
objects
are
linked link%2:31:00::
together
through
the
curious
associations
of
the
subconscious
.
The
resulting
picture
might
appear appear%2:39:00::
a
maze
of
restless
confusions
and
contradictions
,
but
it
is be%2:42:03::
more
true_to_life
than
a
portrait
of
an
artificially
contrived
order
.
The
contemporary
painter
tends tend%2:42:01::
to
depict depict%2:36:01::
not
the
concrete
objects
of
his
experience
but
their
essences
as
revealed reveal%2:39:00::
in
abstractions
of
their
lines
,
colors
,
masses
,
and
energies
.
He
is be%2:42:03::
still
concerned concern%2:42:01::
,
however
,
with
a
personal
event
.
He
accepts accept%2:31:01::
the
accidents
of
his
brushwork
because
they
provide provide%2:40:00::
evidence
of
the
vitality
of
the
experience
of
creation
.
The
work
must
be be%2:42:03::
true_to
both
the
physical
and
the
spiritual
character
of
the
experience
.
Some
painters
have have%2:40:00::
less
interest
in
the
experience
of
the
moment
,
with
its
attendant
urgencies
and
ambiguities
,
than
in
looking look%2:39:00::
beyond
the
flux
of
particular
impressions
to
a
higher
,
more
serene
level
of
truth
.
Rather_than
putting put%2:34:00::
their
trust
in
ephemeral
sensations
they
seek seek%2:40:00::
form
in
the
stable
relationships
of
pure
design
,
which
symbolize symbolize%2:32:00::
an
order
more
real
than
the
disorder
of
the
perceptual
world
.
The
concept
remains remain%2:30:00::
subjective
.
But
in_this
approach
it
is be%2:42:06::
the
artist
's
ultimate
insight
,
rather_than
his
immediate
impressions
,
that
gives give%2:36:01::
form
to
the
work
.
Others
look_to look_to%2:31:00::
more
objective
devices
of
order
.
The
musician
employing employ%2:34:00::
the
serial
technique
of
composition
establishes establish%2:41:00::
a
mathematical
system
of
rotations
that
,
once
set_in_motion set_in_motion%2:35:05::
,
determines determine%2:31:02::
the
sequence
of
pitches
and
even
of
rhythms
and
intensities
.
The
composer
may
reverse reverse%2:30:01::
or
invert invert%2:30:01::
the
order
of
his
original
set
of
intervals
(
or
rhythms
or
dynamic
changes
)
.
He
may
even
alter alter%2:36:00::
the
pattern
by
applying apply%2:34:00::
a
scheme
of
random
numbers
.
But
he
cannot
order order%2:41:01::
his
elements
by
will
,
either
rational
or
inspired
.
The
system
works work%2:35:02::
as
an
impersonal
mechanism
.
Musicians
who
use use%2:34:01::
the
chance
method
also
exclude exclude%2:31:01::
subjective
control
of
formal
development
.
Again
,
the
composer
must
select select%2:31:00::
his
own
materials
.
But
a
tossing
of
coins
,
with
perhaps
the
added
safeguard
of
reference_to
the
oracles
of
the
I
Ching
,
the
Chinese
Book
of
Changes
,
dictates dictate%2:32:00::
the
handling
of
the
chosen
materials
.
Avant-garde
choreographers
,
seeking seek%2:40:00::
new
forms
of
continuity
for
their
new
vocabulary
of
movements
,
have
turned_to turn_to%2:31:00::
similar
approaches
.
Some
let let%2:41:00::
dances
take take%2:30:01::
their
form
from
the
experience
of
creation
.
According
to
Katherine_Litz
,
``
the
becoming
,
the
process
of
realization
,
is be%2:42:06::
the
dance
''
.
The
process
stipulates stipulate%2:32:00::
that
the
choreographer
sense sense%2:39:00::
the
quality
of
the
initial
movement
he
has
discovered discover%2:36:00::
and
that
he
feel feel%2:39:00::
the
rightness
of
the
quality
that
is
to
follow follow%2:42:00::
it
.
The
sequence
may
involve involve%2:42:01::
a
sharp
contrast
:
for_example
,
a
quiet
meditative
sway
of
the
body
succeeded succeed%2:41:01::
by
a
violent
leap
;
or
it
may
involve involve%2:42:01::
more
subtle
distinctions
:
the
sway
may
be
gradually
minimized minimize%2:30:00::
or
enlarged enlarge%2:30:03::
,
its
rhythmic
emphasis
may
be
slightly
modified modify%2:30:00::
,
or
it
may
be
transferred transfer%2:40:01::
to
become become%2:42:01::
a
movement
of
only
the
arms
or
the
head
.
Even
the_least
alteration
will
change change%2:30:01::
the
quality
.
An
exploration
of
these
possible
relationships
constitutes constitute%2:42:00::
the
process
of
creation
and
thereby
gives give%2:36:01::
form
to
the
dance
.
The
approach
to
the
depiction
of
the
experience
of
creation
may
be be%2:42:03::
analytic
,
as
it
is be%2:42:03::
for
Miss_Litz
,
or
spontaneous
,
as
it
is be%2:42:03::
for
Merle_Marsicano
.
She
,
too
,
is be%2:42:03::
concerned
with
``
the
becoming
,
the
process
of
realization
''
,
but
she
does
not
think think%2:31:00::
in_terms_of
subtle
variations
of
spatial
or
temporal
patterns
.
The
design
is
determined determine%2:31:02::
emotionally
:
``
I
must
reach reach%2:35:00::
into
myself
for
the
spring
that
will
send send%2:38:01::
me
catapulting catapult%2:35:00::
recklessly
into
the
chaos
of
event
with
which
the
dance
confronts confront%2:33:00::
me
''
.
Looking_back look_back%2:31:00::
,
Miss_Marsicano
feels feel%2:31:00::
that
her
ideas
may
have
been
influenced influence%2:41:00::
by
those
of
Jackson_Pollock
.
At_one_time
she
felt feel%2:37:00::
impelled impel%2:36:00::
to
make make%2:36:00::
dances
that
``
moved move%2:38:03::
all_over
the
stage
''
,
much_as
Pollock
's
paintings
move_violently
over
the
full
extent
of
the
canvas
.
But
her
conscious
need
was be%2:42:06::
to
break_away break_away%2:38:01::
from
constricting
patterns
of
form
,
a
need
to
let let%2:41:00::
the
experience
shape shape%2:31:00::
itself
.
Midi_Garth
also
believes believe%2:31:01::
in
subjective
continuity
that
begins begin%2:42:00::
with
the
feeling
engendered engender%2:36:00::
by
an
initial
movement
.
It
may
be be%2:42:06::
a
free
front-back
swing
of
the
leg
,
leading lead%2:38:02::
to
a
sideways
swing
of
the
arm
that
develops develop%2:30:06::
into
a
turn
and
the
sensation
of
taking_off take_off%2:38:00::
from
the
ground
.
This
became become%2:42:01::
a
dance
called
Prelude
to
Flight
.
A
pervading
quality
of
free
lyricism
and
a
building
from
turns
close_to
the
ground
towards
jumps
into
the
air
gives give%2:40:03::
the
work
its
central
focus
.
Alwin_Nikolais
objects object%2:32:00::
to
art
as
an
outpouring
of
personal
emotion
.
He
seeks seek%2:41:00::
to
make make%2:30:00::
his
dancers
more
``
godlike
''
by
relating relate%2:31:00::
them
to
the
impersonal
elements
of
shape
,
light
color
,
and
sound
.
If
his
dancers
are
sometimes
made make%2:30:00::
to
look look%2:39:01::
as
if
they
might
be be%2:42:06::
creatures
from
Mars
,
this
is be%2:42:03::
consistent_with
his
intention
of
placing place%2:36:00::
them
in
the
orbit
of
another
world
,
a
world
in_which
they
are
freed free%2:40:02::
of
their
pedestrian
identities
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
through
the
metamorphosed
dancer
that
the
germ
of
form
is
discovered discover%2:32:04::
.
In
his
recognition
of
his
impersonal
self
the
dancer
moves move%2:38:03::
,
and
this
self
,
in
the
``
first
revealed
stroke
of
its
existence
''
,
states state%2:32:00::
the
theme
from
which
all
else
must
follow follow%2:41:00::
.
The
theme
may
be be%2:42:06::
the
formation
of
a
shape
from
which
other
shapes
evolve evolve%2:30:00::
.
It
may
be be%2:42:06::
a
reaction
to
a
percussive
sound
,
the
following
movements
constituting constitute%2:42:00::
further
reactions
.
It
may
establish establish%2:31:00::
the
relation
of
the
figure
of
the
dancer
to
light
and
color
,
in_which
case
changes
in
the
light
or
color
will
set_off set_off%2:36:00::
a
kaleidescope
of
visual
designs
.
Unconcerned
with
the
practical
function
of
his
actions
,
the
dancer
is
engrossed engross%2:31:02::
exclusively
in
their
``
motional
content
''
.
Movements
unfold unfold%2:30:00::
freely
because
they
are be%2:42:03::
uninhibited
by
emotional
bias
or
purposive
drive
.
But
the
metamorphosis
must
come come%2:30:01::
first
.
Though
he
is be%2:42:03::
also
concerned
with
freeing free%2:40:02::
dance
from
pedestrian
modes
of
activity
,
Merce_Cunningham
has
selected select%2:31:00::
a
very
different
method
for
achieving achieve%2:41:00::
his
aim
.
He
rejects reject%2:31:00::
all
subjectively
motivated
continuity
,
any
line
of
action
related relate%2:41:01::
to
the
concept
of
cause
and
effect
.
He
bases base%2:31:00::
his
approach
on
the
belief
that
anything
can
follow follow%2:42:00::
anything
.
An
order
can
be
chanced chance%2:41:01::
rather_than
chosen choose%2:31:00::
,
and
this
approach
produces produce%2:36:02::
an
experience
that
is be%2:42:03::
``
free
and
discovered
rather_than
bound
and
remembered
''
.
Thus
,
there
is be%2:42:04::
freshness
not_only
in
the
individual
movements
of
the
dance
but
in
the
shape
of
their
continuity
as_well
.
Chance
,
he
finds find%2:31:10::
,
enables enable%2:30:00::
him
to
create create%2:36:00::
``
a
world
beyond
imagination
''
.
He
cites cite%2:32:02::
with
pleasure
the
comment
of
a
lady
,
who
exclaimed exclaim%2:32:00::
after
a
concert
:
``
Why
,
it
's
extremely
interesting
.
But
I
would
never
have
thought_of think_of%2:36:00::
it
myself
''
.
The
sequence
of
movements
in
a
Cunningham
dance
is be%2:42:03::
unlike
any
sequence
to
be
seen see%2:39:00::
in
life
.
At
one
side
of
the
stage
a
dancer
jumps jump%2:38:00::
excitedly
;
nearby
,
another
sits sit%2:35:00::
motionless
,
while
still
another
is
twirling twirl%2:38:01::
an
umbrella
.
A
man
and
a
girl
happen happen%2:30:02::
to
meet meet%2:38:01::
;
they
look look%2:39:00::
straight
at
the
audience
,
not
at
each
other
.
He
lifts lift%2:35:00::
her
,
puts put_down%2:35:02::
her
down
,
and
walks walk%2:38:00::
off
,
neither
pleased
nor
disturbed
,
as
if
nothing
had
happened happen%2:30:00::
.
If
one
dancer
slaps slap%2:35:00::
another
,
the
victim
may
do do%2:41:01::
a
pirouette
,
sit_down sit_down%2:38:00::
,
or
offer offer%2:40:00::
his
assailant
a
fork
and
spoon
.
Events
occur occur%2:30:00::
without
apparent
reason
.
Their
consequences
are be%2:42:03::
irrelevant
-
or
there
are be%2:42:00::
no
consequences
at_all
.
The
sequence
is
determined determine%2:31:02::
by_chance
,
and
Mr._Cunningham
makes make%2:30:00::
use
of
any
one
of
several
chance
devices
.
