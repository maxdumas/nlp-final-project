Never
before
has
the
introduction
of
a
weapon
caused cause%2:36:00::
so_much
apprehension
and
fear
.
Nuclear_weapons
are be%2:42:03::
fearsome
,
but
the
long-range
ballistic_missile
gives give%2:40:03::
them
a
stealth
and
merciless
swiftness
which
is be%2:42:03::
much
more
terrifying
.
A
great
many
writers
are
bewitched bewitch%2:37:00::
by
the
apparently
overwhelming
advantage
an
attacker
would
have have%2:42:00::
if
he
were
to
strike strike%2:33:00::
with
complete
surprise
using use%2:34:01::
nuclear
rockets
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
relatively
easy
to
go go%2:41:00::
a
step
further
and
reason reason%2:31:01::
that
an
attacker
,
in
possession
of
such
absolute
power
,
would
simultaneously
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
his
opponent
's
cities
and
people
.
With
a
nation
defenseless
before
it
,
why
would
the
attacker
spare spare%2:41:00::
the
victim
's
people
?
Would
n't
the
wanton
destruction
of
cities
and
people
be be%2:42:06::
the
logical
act
of
complete
subjugation
?
The
nation
would
be
utterly
devastated devastate%2:30:00::
.
The
will
of
its
people
,
so
crucial
in_time
of
peril
,
would
be
broken break%2:35:01::
.
Nuclear_weapons
have
given give%2:40:03::
the
world
the
means
for
self-destruction
in
hours
or
days
;
and
now
rockets
have
given give%2:40:03::
it
the
means
to
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
itself
in
minutes
.
At
this
point
it
should
be be%2:42:03::
painfully
obvious
that
cities
,
being be%2:42:03::
``
soft
''
,
and
the
people
within
them
are be%2:42:03::
ideally
suited
to
destruction
by
nuclear_weapons
.
However
,
because
this
vulnerability
is be%2:42:03::
mutual
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
to
the
advantage
of
neither
side
to
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
the
opponent
's
cities
,
at_least
so_long
as
the
opponent
has have%2:40:00::
nuclear_weapons
with
which
to
effect effect%2:36:00::
reprisal
.
It
should
be be%2:42:03::
appallingly
apparent
that
city-trading
is be%2:42:03::
not
a
profitable
military
tactic
.
ICBMs
have
given give%2:40:03::
us
a
capability
which
could
be
used use%2:34:01::
in
two
different
ways
.
They
could
be
used use%2:34:01::
to
attack attack%2:33:00::
a
nation
's
people
(
which
would
inevitably
mean mean%2:42:00::
the
loss
of
the
attacker
's
own
people
)
,
or
they
could
be
used use%2:34:01::
with
discrimination
to
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
the
enemy
's
military_force
.
If
our
national
interest
lies_in lie_in%2:42:00::
being be%2:42:03::
able_to
fight fight%2:33:01::
and
win win%2:33:00::
a
war
rather_than
committing commit%2:41:00::
national
suicide
,
then
we
must
take take%2:41:04::
a
much
more
penetrating
look
at
ballistic_missiles
.
We
must
determine determine%2:31:00::
whether
missiles
can
win win%2:33:00::
a
war
all
by
themselves
.
We
must
make make%2:36:00::
certain
that
the
aircraft
is be%2:42:03::
finished
before
we
give give%2:40:00::
the
entire
job
to
the
missile
.
Missiles
are be%2:42:03::
very
valuable
weapons
,
but
they
also
have have%2:42:00::
their
too
little
known
limitations
.
Because
of
a
missile
's
ballistic_trajectory
,
the
location
of
a
fixed
target
must
be
known know%2:31:01::
quite
accurately
.
Placing place%2:40:00::
missiles
in
submarines
,
on
barges
,
railroads
,
highways
,
surface
vessels
and
in_the_air
provides provide%2:40:00::
them
with
passive
protection
by
taking_advantage take_advantage%2:40:00::
of
the
gravest
weakness
of
long-range
ballistic_missiles
today
-
the
extreme
difficulty
of
destroying destroy%2:36:00::
a
mobile
or
moving
target
with
such
weapons
.
One
must
first
detect detect%2:39:00::
a
fleeting
mobile
or
moving
target
,
decide decide%2:31:00::
that
it
is be%2:42:03::
worthy
of
destruction
,
select select%2:31:00::
the
missile
to
be
fired fire%2:33:00::
against
the
target
,
compute compute%2:31:00::
ballistics
for
the
flight
,
and
prepare prepare%2:30:00::
the
missile
for
firing fire%2:33:02::
.
Even
if
all
these
operations
could
be_performed
instantaneously
,
the
ICBM
still
has have%2:42:00::
a
time
of
flight
to
the
target
of
about
30_minutes
.
Therefore
,
if
the
target
can
significantly
change change%2:30:01::
its
location
in
something
less_than
30_minutes
,
the
probability
of
having
destroyed destroy%2:36:00::
it
is
drastically
lowered lower%2:30:01::
.
Because
of_this
,
it
would
appear appear%2:39:00::
inevitable
that
an
increasing
percentage
of
strategic
missiles
will
seek seek%2:40:00::
self-protection
in
mobility
-
at_least
until
missile
defenses
are
perfected perfect%2:30:00::
which
have have%2:42:00::
an
exceedingly
high
kill
probability
.
In_order_to
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
the
enemy
's
mobile
,
moving
,
or
imprecisely
located
strategic
forces
,
we
must
have have%2:42:00::
a
hunter-killer
capability
in_addition
to
our
missiles
.
Until
this
hunter-killer
operation
can
be_performed
by
spacecraft
,
manned
aircraft
appear appear%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:02::
the
only
means
available
to
us
.
It
seems seem%2:39:01::
reasonable
that
if
general
nuclear
war
is
not
to
be be%2:42:03::
one
cataclysmic
act
of
burning burn%2:30:02::
each
other
's
citizens
to
cinders
,
we
must
have have%2:40:00::
a
manned
strategic
force
of
long-endurance
aircraft
capable_of
going_into go_into%2:38:00::
China
or
Russia
to
find find%2:40:00::
and
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
their
strategic
forces
which
continued continue%2:42:01::
to
threaten threaten%2:42:00::
us
.
Let
us
suppose suppose%2:32:00::
the
Russians
decide decide%2:31:00::
to
build build%2:36:00::
a
rail-mobile
ICBM
force
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
entirely
feasible
to
employ employ%2:34:00::
aircraft
such_as
the
B-52
or
B-70
in
hunter-killer
operations
against
Soviet
railway-based
missiles
.
If
we
stop stop%2:42:00::
thinking think%2:31:00::
in_terms_of
tremendous
multimegaton
nuclear_weapons
and
consider consider%2:39:00::
employing employ%2:34:00::
much
smaller
nuclear_weapons
which
may
be be%2:42:03::
more
appropriate
for
most
important
military
targets
,
it
would
seem seem%2:39:01::
that
the
B-52
or
B-70
could
carry carry%2:42:03::
a
great
many
small
nuclear_weapons
.
An
aircraft
with
a
load
of
small
nuclear_weapons
could
very
conceivably
be
given give%2:40:00::
a
mission
to
suppress suppress%2:30:00::
all
trains
operating operate%2:35:03::
within
a
specified
geographic_area
of
Russia
-
provided provide%2:40:00::
that
we
had
used use%2:34:01::
some
of
our
ICBMs
to
degrade degrade%2:35:00::
Russia
's
air_defenses
before
our
bombers
got get%2:38:00::
there
.
The
aircraft
could
be
used use%2:34:01::
to
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
other
mobile
,
fleeting
,
and
imprecisely
located
targets
as_well
as
the
known
,
fixed
and
hardened
targets
which
can
also
be
destroyed destroy%2:35:00::
by
missile
.
Why
,
then
,
are
n't
we
planning plan%2:31:00::
a
larger
,
more
important
role
for
manned
military
aircraft
?
Is
there
any
other
way
to
do do%2:41:01::
the
job
?
Survivability
of
our
strategic
forces
(
Polaris
,
mobile
and
hardened
Minuteman
,
hardened
Atlas
and
Titan
,
and
airborne
Skybolt
)
means mean%2:42:00::
that
it
will
take take%2:40:06::
some
time
,
perhaps
weeks
,
to
destroy destroy%2:35:00::
a
strategic
force
.
War
,
under
these
circumstances
,
cannot
be be%2:42:06::
one
massive
exchange
of
nuclear
devastation
.
Forces
will
survive survive%2:42:02::
a
surprise_attack
,
and
these
forces
will
give give%2:40:03::
depth
,
or
considerable
duration
,
to
the
conflict
.
The
forces
which
survive survive%2:42:02::
the
initial
attack
must
be_found
and
destroyed destroy%2:36:00::
.
Even
mobile
forces
must
be_found
and
destroyed destroy%2:36:00::
.
But
,
how
does
one
go_about go_about%2:41:00::
the
job
of
finding find%2:40:00::
and
destroying destroy%2:36:00::
mobile
forces
?
They
are be%2:42:03::
not
susceptible_to
wholesale
destruction
by
ballistic_missile
.
Some_day
,
many
years
in_the_future
,
true
spacecraft
will
be be%2:42:03::
able_to
find find%2:40:00::
and
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
mobile
targets
.
But
until
we
have have%2:40:00::
an
effective
spacecraft
,
the
answer
to
the
hunter-killer
problem
is be%2:42:06::
manned
aircraft
.
However
,
the
aircraft
which
we
have have%2:40:00::
today
are
tied tie%2:30:01::
to
large
,
``
soft
''
airfields
.
Nuclear
rockets
can
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
airfields
with
ease
.
Here
then
is be%2:42:04::
our
problem
:
aircraft
are be%2:42:03::
vital
to
winning win%2:33:00::
a
war
today
because
they
can
perform perform%2:41:02::
those
missions
which
a
missile
is be%2:42:03::
totally
incapable_of
performing perform%2:36:00::
;
but
the
airfield
,
on_which
the
aircraft
is be%2:42:03::
completely
dependent
,
is
doomed doom%2:32:01::
by
the
missile
.
This
makes make%2:30:00::
today
's
aircraft
a
one-shot
,
or
one
mission
,
weapon
.
Aircraft
are be%2:42:03::
mighty
expensive
if
you
can
use use%2:34:01::
them
only
once
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
the
point
on_which
so
many
people
have
written_off write_off%2:31:00::
the
aircraft
in
favor
of
the
missile
.
But
remember remember%2:31:01::
this
-
it
is be%2:42:06::
n't
the
aircraft
which
is be%2:42:03::
vulnerable
to
nuclear
rockets
,
it
is be%2:42:06::
the
airfield
.
Eliminate eliminate%2:42:01::
the
vulnerability
of
aircraft
on_the_ground
and
you
have
essentially
eliminated eliminate%2:42:01::
its
vulnerability
to
long-range
ballistic_missiles
.
There
are be%2:42:00::
four
rather
obvious
ways
to
reduce reduce%2:30:00::
or
eliminate eliminate%2:42:01::
the
vulnerability
of
aircraft
on_the_ground
:
Put put%2:35:00::
aircraft
in
``
bomb-proof
''
hangars
when
they
are be%2:42:05::
on_the_ground
.
Build build%2:36:00::
long-range
aircraft
which
can
take_off take_off%2:38:02::
from
small
(
3000
-
foot
)
airfields
with
runways
.
If
we
could
use use%2:34:01::
all
the
small
airfields
we
have have%2:40:00::
in_this
country
,
we
could
disperse disperse%2:35:00::
our
strategic
aircraft
by
a
factor
of
10
or
more
.
Use use%2:34:01::
nuclear
propulsions
to
keep keep%2:42:00::
our
long-range
military
aircraft
in_the_air
for
the
majority
of
their
useful
life
.
Using use%2:34:01::
very
high
thrust-to-weight
ratio
engines
,
develop develop%2:36:01::
a
vertical-takeoff-and-landing
(
VTOL
)
long-range
military
aircraft
.
We
have have%2:40:00::
the
technology
today
with
which
to
build build%2:36:00::
aircraft
shelters
which
could
withstand withstand%2:42:00::
at_least
200
psi
.
We
could
put put%2:35:00::
a
portion
of
our
strategic
bombers
in
such
shelters
.
Large
,
long-range
bombers
can
be
developed develop%2:36:01::
which
would
have have%2:42:00::
the
capability
to
take_off take_off%2:38:00::
from
3000
-
foot
runways
,
but
they
would
require require%2:42:00::
more
powerful
engines
than
we
have have%2:40:00::
today
.
There
is be%2:42:00::
little
enthusiasm
for
spending spend%2:40:00::
money
to
develop develop%2:36:01::
more
powerful
engines
because
of
the
erroneous_belief
that
the
aircraft
has
been
made make%2:36:00::
obsolete
by
the
missile
.
This
same
preoccupation
with
missiles
at
the
expense
of
aircraft
has
resulted result%2:42:02::
in
our
half-hearted
effort
to
develop develop%2:36:01::
nuclear
propulsion
for
aircraft
.
One
seldom
hears hear%2:39:00::
the
analogy
``
nuclear
propulsion
will
do do%2:36:00::
for
the
aircraft
what
it
has
already
done do%2:36:00::
for
the
submarine
''
.
If
,
for_some_reason
such_as
economy
,
we
are
not
going_to
develop develop%2:36:01::
aircraft
nuclear
propulsion
with
a
sense
of
national
urgency
,
then
we
should
turn turn_to%2:31:00::
our
effort
to
developing develop%2:36:01::
jet_engines
with
a
thrust-to-weight
ratio
of
12
or
15
to
one
.
With
powerplants
such_as
these
,
vertical
takeoff
and
landing
combat
aircraft
could
be
built build%2:36:00::
.
For_example
,
a
12
-
to-one
engine
would
power power%2:34:00::
a
supersonic
VTOL
fighter
.
With
a
15
-
to-one
engine
,
a
supersonic
aircraft
weighing weigh%2:42:01::
300000
pounds
could
rise rise%2:38:00::
vertically
.
The
reason
that
we
are
not
going_ahead go_ahead%2:32:00::
full
speed
to
develop develop%2:36:01::
high
thrust-to-weight
engines
is be%2:42:06::
that
it
would
cost cost%2:42:00::
perhaps
a_billion
dollars
-
and
you
do
n't
spend spend%2:40:00::
that
sort_of
money
if
aircraft
are be%2:42:03::
obsolete
.
When
aircraft
are be%2:42:03::
no_longer
helpless
on
airfields
,
they
are be%2:42:03::
no_longer
vulnerable
to
ICBMs
.
If
our
SAC
bombers
were be%2:42:03::
,
today
,
capable_of
surviving survive%2:42:02::
a
surprise
missile
attack
and
because
of
infinite
dispersion
or
long
endurance
had have%2:40:00::
the
capability
to
strike strike%2:33:00::
at
Russia
again
,
and
again
,
and
again
,
those
bombers
would
unquestionably
assure assure%2:32:03::
our
military
dominance
.
We
would
have have%2:40:00::
the
means
to
seek_out seek_out%2:35:00::
and
destroy destroy%2:35:00::
the
enemy
's
force
-
whether
it
were be%2:42:03::
fixed
or
mobile
.
With
such
a
force
of
manned
bombers
we
could
bring bring%2:36:00::
enormous
pressure
to
bear_on bear_on%2:30:00::
an
enemy
,
and
this
pressure
would
be be%2:42:03::
selective
and
extremely
discriminating
.
No
need
to
kill kill%2:35:00::
an
entire
city
and
all
its
people
because
we
lacked lack%2:42:00::
the
precision
and
reconnaissance
to
selectively
disarm disarm%2:33:00::
the
enemy
's
military_force
.
Our
first
necessity
,
at
the
very
outset
of
war
,
is be%2:42:06::
post-attack
reconnaissance
.
In
a_few
years
we
will
have have%2:40:00::
SAMOS
(
semiautomatic
missile
observation
system
)
.
But
in
the
case
of
moving
targets
,
and
targets
which
have have%2:42:00::
limited
mobility
,
what
will
their
location
be be%2:42:06::
when
it
is be%2:42:04::
time
to
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
them
?
What
targets
have
we
successfully
knocked_out knock_out%2:30:01::
?
A
ballistic_missile
cannot
,
today
,
tell tell%2:32:00::
you
if
it
was be%2:42:03::
successful
or
unsuccessful
.
What
targets
still
remain remain%2:42:05::
to
be
hit hit%2:35:01::
?
These
crucial
questions
must
be
answered answer%2:32:00::
by
post-attack
reconnaissance
.
SAMOS
will
be be%2:42:03::
hard_put
to
see see%2:39:00::
through
clouds
-
and
to
see see%2:39:00::
in
the
dark
.
Even
if
this
is be%2:42:03::
some_day
possible
