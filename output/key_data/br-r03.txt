say

suffered suffer%2:30:00::

Could

Such

them

Never

made make%2:41:00::
no

learn learn%2:31:03::
his

many_a

taken take%2:32:02::

Each

Letch
``
went_up

I
was be%2:42:03::
the
one
to
be be%2:42:03::
patient
,
helpful
and
apologetic
while
he
indulged indulge%2:34:00::
in
outbursts

temperament

profanity

abuse

blaming blame%2:32:00::

,
on
more

I

money
Letch

It
was be%2:42:06::
I
who
paid pay%2:40:00::
for
our
little
home

the
food
,
the
liquor
,
the
servants

even
Letch
's
bills
at
his
tailor
and
the
Los_Angeles
Athletic_Club
.
Never
once
did
he
buy buy%2:40:00::
me
a
single
gift
and
for
our
third
anniversary
he
gave give%2:40:03::
me
a
dislocated
jaw
.
(
But
that
is be%2:42:06::
another
story
.
)
As
for
his
private
monies
,
they
were
rapidly
dissipated dissipate%2:34:00::
in
drinking
,
gaming
and
carousing

More_than

I
was
confronted confront%2:33:00::

staggering
losses

``

I
shuddered shudder%2:38:00::
to
think think%2:36:00::
that
someone
so
dear
to
me
could
even
associate associate%2:41:02::
with
such
a
sinister
milieu
.
And
at
three
different
times
during
our
turbulent
marriage
strange
girls
,
with
the
commonest
of
accents
,
telephoned telephone%2:32:00::
to
announce announce%2:32:00::
to
me
that
Letch
had
sired sire%2:29:00::
their
unborn
children

Having have%2:42:00::
the
deepest
of
maternal
instincts

my
heart
fairly
bled bleed%2:29:00::
when
I
thought_of think_of%2:31:02::
the
darling
pink

white
``
bundles

would
have
proudly
given give%2:40:03::
my

``
Ah
,
you
're be%2:42:03::
too
old

,
was be%2:42:06::
invariably
his
ungallant
and
untrue
retort
whenever
I
suggested suggest%2:32:00::
``
starting start%2:36:00::
a
family

.
Letch
had
made make%2:30:00::
it
abundantly
clear
that
he
did
not
care_for care_for%2:37:01::
the
company
of
my
own
precious
daughter
.
I
now
felt feel%2:31:00::
it
wiser_to
keep keep%2:42:01::
Baby-dear
in
school
and
-
during
the
summers
-
at
a
camp
run run%2:41:02::
by
the
Society_of_Friends
all
year
around
.
Her
presence
only
made make%2:30:00::
Letch
more
distant
and
irritable
and
,
in
the
hurry
of
buying buy%2:40:00::
Chateau_Belletch
,
I
had
neglected neglect%2:41:00::
to
consider consider%2:31:01::
a
room
for
Baby-dear
,
so
there
was
no
place
to
put put%2:35:00::
her
,
anyhow
.
(
I
sometimes
feel feel%2:31:00::
that
God
,
in
His
infinite
wisdom
,
wants want%2:37:00::
us
to
have have%2:39:06::
these
inexplicable
little
lapses
of
memory
.
It
almost
always
works_out work_out%2:42:00::
for
the
best

)
Yet
I
adored adore%2:37:00::
this
man
,
Letch_Feeley
,
why
,
I
cannot
say say%2:32:03::
.
With
faint
heart
and
a
brave
smile
,
I
endured endure%2:31:00::
his
long
absences
from
Chateau_Belletch
,
his
coldness
,
his
indifference
,
his
slights
and
his
abuse
.
The
times
I
can
recall recall%2:31:00::
when
I
was
publicly
humiliated humiliate%2:37:00::
by
him
-
lovely
dinner_parties
in
our
Trianon
Suite
where
the
collation
was
postponed postpone%2:42:00::
and
postponed postpone%2:42:00::
and
postponed postpone%2:42:00::
,
only
to
be
served serve%2:34:00::
dry
and
overcooked
at
a
table
where
the
host
's
chair
was be%2:42:03::
vacant
;
a
``
splash
party
''
at
the
new
pool
,
which
I
had have%2:30:00::
built build%2:36:00::
in
the
hope
of
keeping keep_away%2:41:00::
Letch
away
from
public
beaches
,
when
Letch
and
a
certain
Aquacutie
stayed stay%2:30:00::
underwater
together
for
the
better
part
of
an
hour
;
a
lovely
Epiphany
party
at
Errol_Flynn
's
,
on_which
sacred
occasion
Letch
stole_away steal_away%2:38:00::
with
an
unknown
``
starlet
''
,
leaving leave%2:31:05::
me
``
high
and
dry
''
to
get get%2:38:00::
home
as
best
I
could
.
These
are be%2:42:06::
but
a
sampling
of
the
insults
I
endured endure%2:39:00::
.
As
Mrs._Letch_Feeley
,
was be%2:42:03::
it
any
wonder
that
I
,
once
the
social
arbiter
of
Filmdom
,
was
excluded exclude%2:41:00::
from
the
smart
entertainments
given give%2:36:02::
by
the
Astaires
,
the
Coopers
,
the
Gables
,
the
Colmans
,
the
Rathbones
,
the
Taylors
,
the
Thalbergs
and
such
devout
,
closely_knit
families
as
the
Barrymores
and
the
Crosbys
?
As
Letch
's
antisocial
conduct
increased increase%2:30:00::
,
our
invitations
decreased decrease%2:30:00::
and
my
heart
was be%2:42:05::
in
my
mouth
whenever
I
played play%2:29:01::
hostess
at
a
fashionable
``
screenland
''
gathering
.
Between
1935
and
1939
Letch
and
I
made make%2:36:01::
ten
films
together
,
each
less
successful
,
both
artistically
and
commercially
,
than
the
one
before
it
.
Our
last
joint_venture
,
Sainted_Lady
,
a
deeply
religious
film
based base%2:31:00::
on
the
life
of
Mother_Cabrini
,
and
timed time%2:31:00::
so_that
its
release
date
would
coincide coincide%2:30:00::
with
the
beatification
of
America
's
first
saint
in
November
,
1938
,
was be%2:42:03::
a
fiasco
from_start_to_finish
.
As
I
was
playing play%2:36:02::
Mother_Cabrini
,
the
picture
was be%2:42:03::
actually
``
all
mine
''
,
with
nearly
every
scene
built build%2:36:00::
around
me
.
But
in_order_to
keep keep%2:42:00::
Letch
in_the_public_eye
and
out
of
trouble
,
I
wrote write%2:36:00::
in
a
part
especially
for
him
-
that
of
a
dashing
ruffian
who
``
sees see%2:39:00::
the
light
''
and
is
saved save%2:41:01::
by
the
inspiring
example
of
Mother_Cabrini
.
And
did
he
appreciate appreciate%2:37:00::
my
efforts
on
his
behalf
?
Did
he
trouble trouble%2:41:01::
to
memorize memorize%2:31:00::
the
very
small
part
which
I
had have%2:30:00::
``
tailor-made
''
to
his
specifications
,
a
role
eventually
cut_down
to
three
short
speeches
?
Did
he
show show%2:39:00::
the
rest
of
the
cast
-
numbering number%2:42:00::
four
thousand
-
the
consideration
of
arriving_at arrive_at%2:38:00::

punctually

or
even
at_all

He
did
not
!
The
``

went_on go_on%2:42:00::
for
eight

Most_of

Whenever

deigned deign%2:41:00::
to
appear appear%2:30:00::
at
the
studio
he
was be%2:42:03::
``
hung_over
''
,
uncooperative
,
rude
and
insulting
.
He
made make%2:41:00::
many
tasteless
,
irreverent
and
unfunny
remarks
,
not_only
about
me
in
the
title_role
,
but
about
religion
in_general
.
By
the
time
the
film
was
released release%2:32:00::
we
were be%2:42:03::
three
million
dollars
over-spent
,
war
was be%2:42:03::
imminent
and
the
public
apparently
had
forgotten forget%2:31:01::
all
about
Mother_Cabrini
.
Thanks
to
Letch_Feeley
and
the
terrible
strain
he
imposed impose%2:32:00::
on
me
,
the
notices
were be%2:42:03::
few
and
unfavorable
.
Only
George_Santayana
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
understand understand%2:31:01::
and
appreciate appreciate%2:40:00::
the
film
when
he
wrote write%2:32:00::
:
``
Miss_Poitrine
has
perpetrated perpetrate%2:41:00::

eloquent

the
Protestant

Hollywood
''
.
But
it
was be%2:42:03::
small
consolation
.
In
a
rare
fit
of
anger
and
spite
,
I
``
farmed_out farm_out%2:41:00::
''
my
own
husband
to
a
small
and
most
undistinguished
studio
to
make make%2:36:01::
one
picture
as
a
form
of
punishment
.
(
An
actor
must
have have%2:42:00::
discipline
.
)
The
film
was
called call%2:32:02::
The
Diet
of
Worms
,
which
I
felt feel%2:31:00::
was be%2:42:03::
just
what
Letch
deserved deserve%2:42:00::
.
It
turned_out turn_out%2:42:02::
to
be be%2:42:06::
a
life
of
Martin_Luther
,
of
all
things
!
It
was be%2:42:03::
a
disaster
!
In
clothes
,
Letch
simply
did
not
project project%2:32:00::
.
He
was
laughed_off laugh_off%2:32:00::
the
screen
.
At_the_same_time
,
however
,
I
availed avail%2:34:00::
myself
of
the
services
of_that
great
English
actor
and
master
of
make-up
,
Sir_Gauntley_Pratt
,
to
do do%2:36:01::
a
``
quickie
''
called
The
Mystery
of
the
Mad_Marquess
,
in_which
I
played play%2:36:02::
a
young
American
girl
who
inherits inherit%2:40:00::
a
haunted
castle
on
the_English
moors
which
is
filled fill%2:42:00::
with
secret
passages
and
sliding
panels
and
,
unbeknownst
to
anyone
,
is
still
occupied occupy%2:42:00::
by
an
eccentric
maniac
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
a
``
potboiler
''
made make%2:36:01::
on
a
``
shoestring
''
and
not
the
sort_of

I
like like%2:37:05::

as
all
I
had have%2:42:05::
to
do
was be%2:42:06::
look look%2:29:00::
blank
and
scream scream%2:32:01::
a
great_deal

My
heart
was be%2:42:05::
not
in
it
,
but
,
oddly_enough
,
it
remains remain%2:30:00::
the_most
financially
successful
picture
of
my
career

(
I
watched watch%2:39:05::
it
on
television
late
one
night
last
week
and
it
``
stands_up stand_up%2:33:00::
''
remarkably
well
,
even
twenty
years
later
.
)
Letch
had
returned return%2:38:00::
from
his
debacle
unrepentant
and
more
badly_behaved
than
before

I
really
loved love%2:37:01::
that
boy
,
and
,
in
a
feverish
attempt
to
preserve preserve%2:40:00::
our
marriage
