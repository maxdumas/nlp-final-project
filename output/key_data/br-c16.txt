A
year
ago
it
was
bruited bruit%2:32:00::
that
the
primary
character
in
Erich_Maria_Remarque
's
new
novel
was
based base%2:31:00::
on
the
Marquis_Alfonso
de
Portago
,
the
Spanish
nobleman
who
died die%2:30:00::
driving drive%2:38:01::
in
the
Mille_Miglia
automobile_race
of
1957
.
If
this
was be%2:42:03::
in_fact
Mr._Remarque
's
intention
he
has
achieved achieve%2:41:00::
a
notable
failure
.
Clerfayt
of
``
Heaven
Has have%2:40:00::
No
Favorites
''
resembles resemble%2:42:00::
Portago
only
in_that
he
is be%2:42:03::
male
and
a
race-driver
-
quite
a
bad
race-driver
,
whereas
Portago
was be%2:42:03::
a
good
one
.
He
is be%2:42:03::
a
dull
,
unformed
,
and
aimless
person
;
the
twelfth
Marquis
de
Portago
was be%2:42:03::
intelligent
,
purposeful
,
and
passionate
.
One
looked_forward look_forward%2:31:00::
to
Mr._Remarque
's
ninth
book
if
only
because
not
even
a
reasonably
good
novel
has
yet
been
written write%2:36:00::
grounded ground%2:35:08::
on
automobile
racing
,
as
dramatic
a
sport
as
mankind
has
devised devise%2:36:00::
.
Unhappily
,
``
Heaven
Has have%2:40:00::
No
Favorites
''
does
not
alter alter%2:30:01::
the
record
except
to
add add%2:30:00::
one
more
bad
book
to
the
list
.
Mr._Remarque
's
conception
of_this
novel
was be%2:42:03::
sound
and
perhaps
even
noble
.
He
proposed propose%2:31:00::
throwing throw%2:35:02::
together
a
man
in
an
occupation
of
high
hazard
and
a
woman
balanced
on
a
knife-edge
between
death
from
tuberculosis
and
recovery
.
His
treatment
of_it
is be%2:42:03::
something
else
.
His
heroine
chooses choose%2:31:01::
to
die die%2:30:00::
-
the
price
of
recovery
,
years
under
the
strict
regimen
of
a
sanatorium
,
being be%2:42:03::
higher
than
she
wishes wish%2:37:02::
to
pay pay%2:40:00::
.
Her
lover
precedes precede%2:42:00::
her
in
death
,
at
the
wheel
,
and
presumably
he
too
has
chosen choose%2:31:02::
.
Between
the
first
meeting
of
Clerfayt
and
Lillian
and
this
dismal
denouement
,
Mr._Remarque
has
laid_down lay_down%2:31:00::
many
pages
of
junior-philosophical
discourse
,
some
demure
and
rather
fetching
love-making
,
pleasant
talk
about
some
of
the
countryside
and
restaurants
of
Europe
,
and
a
modicum
of
automobile
racing
.
The
ramblings
on
life
,
death
,
and
the
wonder
of_it
all
are be%2:42:03::
distressing
;
the
love-making
,
perhaps
because
it
is be%2:42:03::
pale
and
low-key
when
one
has
been
conditioned condition%2:41:01::
to
expect expect%2:31:00::
harsh
colors
and
explicitness
,
is be%2:42:03::
often
charming
;
the
automobile
racing
bears bear%2:42:01::
little
relation_to
reality
.
This
latter
failure
is be%2:42:03::
more_than
merely
bad
reportage
and
it
is be%2:42:03::
distinctly
more
important
than
it
would
have
been be%2:42:03::
had
the
author
drawn draw%2:32:00::
Clerfayt
as
,
say
,
a
tournament
golfer

Hazards
to
life
and
limb
on
the

,
while
existent
,
are be%2:42:03::
actuarially
insignificant

Race-drivers
,
on_the_other_hand
,
are
quite
often
killed kill%2:35:00::
on
the
circuit
,
and
since
it
was be%2:42:03::
obviously
Mr._Remarque
's
intention
to
establish establish%2:41:00::
automobile
racing
as
life
in
microcosm

one
might
reasonably
have
expected expect%2:31:00::
him
to
demonstrate demonstrate%2:39:01::
precise
knowledge
not_only
of
techniques
but
of
mores
and
attitudes
.
He
does do%2:36:01::
not
.
The
jacket
biography
describes describe%2:32:00::
him
as
a
former
racing
driver
,
and
he
may
indeed
have
been be%2:42:03::
,
although
I
do
not
recall recall%2:31:00::
having
encountered encounter%2:40:00::
his
name
either
in
the
records
or
the
literature
.
Perhaps
he
has
only
forgotten forget%2:31:01::
a
great_deal
.
The
book
carries carry%2:32:02::
a
disclaimer
in_which
Remarque
says say%2:32:00::
it
has
been be%2:42:03::
necessary
for
him
to
take take%2:41:04::
minor
liberties
with
some
of
the
procedures
and
formalities
of
racing

The
necessity
is be%2:42:03::
not

me

and
,
in_any_case

to

But
it

in

is be%2:42:06::
the
primary
concern
of
the
book

that

's
failure

plainest

neurotic

To
be be%2:42:03::
human
,
he

to

quite
everything
Mr._Remarque
hoped hope%2:31:00::
to
tell tell%2:32:00::
us
.
However
,
my
principal
objection
in_this
sort_of
novel
is be%2:42:03::
to
the
hackneyed
treatment
of
race-drivers
,
pilots
,
submariners
,
atomic
researchers
,
and
all
the
machine-masters
of
our
age
as
brooding
mystics
or
hysterical
fatalists
.
The
West
is be%2:42:03::
leaderless
,
according accord%2:42:00::
to
this
book
.
In
contrast
,
the
East
is
ably
led lead%2:41:00::
by
such
stalwart
heroes
as
Khrushchev
,
Tito
,
and
Mao
.
Against
this
invincible
determination
to
communize communize%2:30:01::
the
whole
world
stands stand%2:42:00::
a
group
of
nations
unable
to
agree agree%2:32:00::
on
fundamentals
and
each
refusing refuse%2:32:00::
to
make make%2:36:08::
any
sacrifice
of
sovereignty
for
the
common
good
of
all
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
Field_Marshal
Montgomery
's
belief
that
in
most
Western
countries
about
60
per_cent
of
the
people
do
not
really
care care%2:37:02::
about
democracy
or
Christianity
;
about
30
per_cent
call call%2:32:00::;2:32:02::
themselves
Christians
in_order_to
keep_up keep_up%2:40:00::
appearances
and
be
considered consider%2:31:00::
respectable
,
and
only
the
last
10
per_cent
are be%2:42:03::
genuine
Christians
and
believers
in
democracy
.
But
these
Western
countries
do
care care%2:37:02::
about
themselves
.
Each
feels feel%2:37:00::
intensely
national
.
If
,
say
,
the
Russians
intended intend%2:31:00::
to
stop stop%2:41:00::
Tom_Jones
'
going_to go_to%2:38:00::
the
pub
,
then
Tom_Jones
would
fight fight%2:33:00::
the
Commies
.
But
he
would
fight fight%2:33:00::
for
his
own
liberty
rather_than
for
any
abstract
principle
connected connect%2:31:00::
with_it
-
such_as
``
cause
''
.
For
all
practical
purposes
,
the
West
stands stand%2:42:04::
disunited
,
undedicated
,
and
unprepared
for
the
tasks
of
world
leadership
.
With
this
barrage
,
Montgomery
of
Alamein
launches launch%2:41:01::
his
attack
upon
the
blunderings
of
the
West
.
Never
given give%2:31:02::
to
mincing mince%2:32:00::
words
,
he
places place%2:33:03::
heavy
blame
upon
the
faulty
,
uncourageous
leadership
of
Britain
and
particularly
America
.
At_war
's
end
leadership
in
Western
Europe
passed pass%2:40:00::
from
Britain
because
the
Labour_Government
devoted devote%2:32:00::
its
attention
to
the
creation
of
a
welfare_state
.
With
Britain
looking look%2:39:00::
inward
,
overseas
problems
were
neglected neglect%2:31:01::
and
the
baton
was
passed_on pass_on%2:40:01::
to
the
United_States
.
Montgomery
believes believe%2:31:04::
that
she
started start%2:30:00::
well
.
``
America
gave give%2:40:00::
generously
in
economic
aid
and
military
equipment
to
friend
and
foe
alike
''
.
She
pushed push%2:38:00::
wartorn
and
poverty-stricken
nations
into
prosperity
,
but
she
failed fail%2:41:02::
to
lead lead%2:32:00::
them
into
unity
and
world
peace
.
America
has
divided divide%2:41:00::
more_than
she
has
united unite%2:30:00::
the
West
.
The
reasons
are be%2:42:06::
that
America
generally
believes believe%2:31:00::
that
she
can
buy buy%2:40:00::
anything
with
dollars
,
and
that
she
compulsively
strives strive%2:41:00::
to
be
liked like%2:37:04::
.
However
,
she
really
does
not
know know%2:31:01::
how
to
match match%2:42:00::
the
quantity
of
dollars
given_away give_away%2:40:00::
by
a
quality
of
leadership
that_is
basically
needed need%2:42:00::
.
But
the
greater
reason
for
fumbling
,
stumbling
American
leadership
is be%2:42:03::
due_to
the
shock
her
pride
suffered suffer%2:29:01::
when
the
Japanese
attacked attack%2:33:00::
at
Pearl_Harbor
.
``
They
are be%2:42:03::
determined
''
,
Montgomery
writes write%2:36:00::
,
``
not
to
be
surprised surprise%2:31:00::
again
,
and
now
insist insist%2:32:00::

is be%2:42:03::

unnecessary

also

The
net

is be%2:42:06::
that
under

To

The

is
made make%2:30:00::

will

,
a
person
in
whom
all
the
member

will
have have%2:40:00::

This
leader
must
be be%2:42:03::
a
man
who
lives live%2:42:06::
above
illusions
that
heretofore
have
shaped shape%2:36:00::
the

namely
that

to

Germany

that
the
East_German
government
does
not
exist exist%2:42:00::
,
that
events
in
Japan
in
June
1960
were be%2:42:03::
Communist-inspired
,
that
the
true
government
of
China
is be%2:42:03::
in
Formosa

that

was be%2:42:03::
the
evil
influence

1960
,
and
that
either
China

Russia
wants want%2:37:00::

Such

But
then

Mario_Lanza
