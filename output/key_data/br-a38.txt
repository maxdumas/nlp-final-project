The
Masters
golf
tournament
proved prove%2:31:00::
last
Monday
what
it
can
do do%2:41:01::
to
the
strongest
men
and
the
staunchest
nerves
.
Gary_Player
,
the
small
,
trim
South_African
,
was be%2:42:03::
the
eventual
winner
,
but
in_all
his
25
years
he
never
spent spend%2:42:00::
a
more
harrowing
afternoon
as
he
waited wait%2:42:00::
for
the
victory
to
drop drop%2:38:05::
in
his
lap
.
Arnold_Palmer
,
the
defending
champion
,
lost lose%2:40:02::
his
title
on
the
72
nd
hole
after
a_few
minutes
of
misfortune
that
left leave%2:42:02::
even
his
fellow
pros
gaping gape%2:39:00::
in
disbelief
.
``
Just
when
you

,
Player
had
said say%2:32:01::
one
afternoon
midway
through
the
tournament
.
And
that
is be%2:42:03::
just
what
happened happen%2:30:01::
on
the
last
few
holes
.
The
Augusta_National
Golf_Club
Course
got_up get_up%2:38:00::
and
bit bite%2:35:00::
both
Player
and
Palmer
.
Player
was be%2:42:03::
the
first
to
feel feel%2:35:00::
its
teeth
.
After
playing play%2:33:00::
a
splendid
first
nine
holes
in
34
-
two
strokes
under
par
-
on
this
fifth
and
final
day
of
the
tournament
(
Sunday
's
fourth
round
had
been
washed_out wash_out%2:41:00::
by
a
violent
rainstorm
when
it
was be%2:41:00::
only
half
completed complete%2:30:02::
)
,
Player
's
game
rapidly
fell fall%2:30:08::
to
pieces
.
He
bogeyed bogey%2:35:00::

After
a
journey
through
woods
and
stream
he

He

by
missing miss%2:33:00::
a
short
putt
and
finally
scrambled scramble%2:38:00::
through
the
last
three
holes
without
further
mishap
for
a
2
-
over-par
74
and
a
72
-
hole
total
of
280
.
As
he
signed sign%2:32:02::
his
scorecard
and
walked walk%2:38:00::
off
the
course
,
Player
was be%2:42:03::
almost
in
tears
.
He
could
read read%2:31:00::
on
the
nearby
scoreboard
that
Palmer
,
by
then
playing play%2:33:00::
the
15
th
hole
,
was
leading lead%2:42:01::
him
by
a
stroke
.
Palmer
had
started start%2:42:00::
the
round
four
strokes
behind
Player
,
and
at
one
point
in
the
afternoon
had
trailed trail%2:38:02::
by
as_many
as
six
strokes
.
Now
all
he
had have%2:42:05::
to
do do%2:41:04::
was
finish finish%2:42:00::
in
even
par
to
collect collect%2:40:01::
the
trophy
and
the
biggest
single
paycheck
in
golf
.
When
Palmer
hit hit%2:35:03::
a
good
straight
drive
up
the
fairway
on
the
72
nd
hole
,
he
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
have
the
championship
won
.
But
the
seven-iron
shot
he
used use%2:34:01::
to
approach approach%2:38:00::
the
green
strayed stray%2:38:00::
into
a
bunker
and
lodged lodge%2:35:00::
in
a
slight
depression
.
In
trying try%2:41:00::
to
hit hit%2:35:03::
it
out
with
a
sand_wedge
Palmer
bounced bounce%2:35:03::
the
ball
over
the
green
,
past
spectators
and
down
the
slope
toward
a
TV
tower
.
Afterwards
,
Palmer
told tell%2:32:04::
Charlie_Coe
,
his
last-round
partner
,
that
he
simply
played play%2:33:00::
the
hole
too
fast
.
He
did
seem seem%2:39:00::
hasty
on
his
second
and
third
shots
,
but
then
there
was be%2:42:08::
an
agonizing
wait
of
several
minutes
while
Coe
graciously
putted putt%2:35:00::
out
,
giving give%2:40:05::
Palmer
a
chance
to
recover recover%2:40:00::
his
composure
,
which
he
had
quite
visibly
lost lose%2:40:02::
.
When
the
shaken
Palmer
finally
did
hit hit%2:35:03::
his
fourth
shot
,
he
overshot overshoot%2:33:00::
the
hole
by
15
feet
.
Palmer
was
now
putting putt%2:35:00::
merely
for
a
tie
,
and
Player
,
who
was
sitting sit%2:35:00::
beside
his
wife
and
watching watch%2:39:05::
it
all
on
television
in
Tournament_Chairman_Clifford_Roberts
'
clubhouse
apartment
,
stared stare%2:39:00::
in
amazement
when
Palmer
missed miss%2:33:00::
the
putt
.
Palmer
's
281
for
the
four
rounds
at
Augusta
was be%2:42:03::
a
comfortable
four
strokes
ahead
of
the
next
closest
pro
,
but
it
was be%2:42:03::
barely
good
enough
for
a
second-place
tie
with
Coe
.
The
lean
and
leathery
Oklahoma
amateur
,
who
has
been
playing play%2:33:00::
topnotch
tournament
golf
for
many
years
,
refused refuse%2:32:00::
to
let let%2:41:00::
the
Masters
jitters
overtake overtake%2:33:00::
him
and
closed close%2:41:01::
the
tournament
with
his
second
straight
69
.
Until
late
last
Saturday
afternoon
Palmer
had
played play%2:33:00::
seven
consecutive
rounds_of_golf
at
the
Masters
-
four
last
year
and
three
this
-
without
ever
being be%2:42:03::
out
of
first
place
.
As
evening
approached approach%2:38:01::
and
Palmer
finished finish%2:42:00::
his
Saturday
round
with
a
disappointing
one-over-par
73
,
this
remarkable
record
was be%2:41:00::
still
intact
,
thanks
to
his
Thursday
and
Friday
rounds
of
68
and
69
.
His
three-round
total
of
210
was be%2:42:03::
three
strokes
better
than
the
next
best
score
,
a
213
by
Bill_Collins
,
the
tall
and
deliberate
Baltimorean
who
had
been
playing play%2:33:00::
very_well
all
winter
long
.
But
Palmer
knew know%2:31:02::
,
as
did
everybody
else
at
Augusta
,
that
his
streak
was be%2:42:03::
about
to
be be%2:41:00::
broken break%2:30:03::
.
Half
an
hour
after
he
finished finish%2:42:00::
his
round
,
Player
holed_out hole_out%2:35:00::
at
the
18
th
green
with
a
69
and
a
three-round
total
of
206
,
four
strokes
ahead
of
Palmer
.
More_than
a
streak
had
ended end%2:42:00::
.
Long
after
the
erratic
climate
and
the
washed-out
final
round
on
Sunday
have
become become%2:42:01::
meteorological
footnotes
,
the
1961
Masters
will
be
remembered
as
the
scene
of
the
mano
a
mano
between
Arnold_Palmer
and
Gary_Player
.
Unlike
most
such
sports
rivalries
,
it
appeared appear%2:39:00::
to
have
developed develop%2:42:00::
almost
spontaneously
,
although
this
was be%2:42:00::
not
exactly
the
case
.
When
the
winter
tour
began begin%2:30:00::
at
Los_Angeles
last
January
there
was be%2:42:08::
no
one
in_sight
to
challenge challenge%2:32:01::
Palmer
's
towering
prestige
.
As
if
to
confirm confirm%2:31:00::
his
stature
,
he
quickly
won win%2:33:00::
three
of
the
first
eight
tournaments
.
Player
won win%2:33:00::
only
one
.
But
as
the
tour
reached reach%2:38:00::
Pensacola
a
month
ago
,
Player
was
leading lead%2:42:01::
Palmer
in
official
winnings
by
a_few
hundred
dollars
,
and
the
rest
of
the
field
was be%2:42:03::
somewhere
off
in
nowhere
.
On
the
final
round
at
Pensacola
,
the
luck
of
the
draw
paired pair%2:41:00::
Palmer
and
Player
in
the
same
threesome
and
,
although
it
was be%2:42:03::
far
from
obvious
at_the_time
,
the
gallery
was
treated treat%2:40:00::
to
the
first
chapter
of_what
promises promise%2:32:00::
to
be be%2:41:00::
one
of
the_most
exciting
duels
in
sport
for
a
long_time
to
come come%2:30:01::
.
On_that
final
Sunday
at
Pensacola
neither
Palmer
nor
Player
was
leading lead%2:42:01::
the
tournament
and
,
as
it
turned_out turn_out%2:42:01::
,
neither
won win%2:33:00::
it
.
But
whichever
of
these
two
finished finish%2:42:00::
ahead
of
the
other
would
be be%2:42:08::
the
undisputed
financial
leader
of
the
tour
.
Player
immediately
proved prove%2:31:00::
he
was
not
in_the_least
awed awe%2:37:00::
by
the
dramatic
proximity
of
Palmer
.
He
outplayed outplay%2:33:00::
Palmer
all_around
the
course
and
finished finish%2:42:00::
with
a
tremendous
65
to
Palmer
's
71
.
Thereafter
,
until
the
Masters
,
Player
gradually
increased increase%2:30:00::
his
lead
over
Palmer
in
winnings
and
added add%2:30:00::
one
more
tournament
victory
at
Miami
.
When
they
reached reach%2:38:01::
Augusta
last
week
,
together
they
had
won win%2:33:00::
five
of
the
13
tournaments
to_date
.
On
Thursday
,
the
first
day
of
the
Masters
,
the
contest
between
Palmer
and
Player
developed develop%2:42:00::
instantly
.
It
was be%2:41:00::
a
dismal
,
drizzly
day
but
a
good
one
on_which
to
score score%2:33:00::
over
the
Augusta_National
course
.
The
usually
skiddy
greens
were be%2:42:03::
moist
and
soft
,
so
the
golfers
were be%2:42:03::
able
to
strike strike%2:35:00::
their
approach_shots
boldly
at
the
flag-stick
and
putt putt%2:35:00::
firmly
toward
the
hole
without
too_much
worry
about
the
consequences
.
Palmer
's
4
-
under-par
68
got get%2:30:02::
him
off
to
an
early
lead
,
which
he
shared share%2:42:00::
with
Bob_Rosburg
.
But
Player
was be%2:42:03::
only
one
stroke
back
,
with
a
69
.
Even_so
,
it
was be%2:42:03::
still
not
clear
to
many
in
the
enormous
horde
of
spectators
-
unquestionably
the
largest
golf
crowd
ever
-
that
this
tournament
was be%2:42:03::
to
be be%2:42:07::
,
essentially
,
a
match
between
Palmer
and
Player
.
A_lot_of
people
were
still
thinking_about think_about%2:31:05::
Jack_Nicklaus
,
the
spectacular
young
amateur
,
who
had have%2:40:02::
a
70
;
or
Ken_Venturi
,
who
had have%2:40:02::
a
somewhat
shaky
72
but
was be%2:42:03::
bound_to
do
better
;
or
Rosburg
,
whose
accurate
short
game
and
supersensitive
putter
can
overcome overcome%2:33:01::
so
many_of
Augusta
's
treacheries
;
or
even
old
Byron_Nelson
,
whose
excellent
71
made make%2:36:15::
one
wonder wonder%2:31:00::
if
he
had
solved solve%2:31:00::
the
geriatric
aspects
of
golf
.
(
On
Thursday
nobody
except
Charlie_Coe
was
thinking_of think_of%2:31:02::
Charlie_Coe
.
)
On
Friday
,
a
day
as
cloudless
and
lovely
as
Thursday
had
been be%2:42:03::
gray
and
ugly
,
the
plot
of
the
tournament
came come%2:30:01::
clearly
into
focus
.
Rosburg
had
started start%2:42:00::
early
in
the
day
,
and
by
the
time
Palmer
and
Player
were be%2:42:05::
on
the
course
-
separated separate%2:38:01::
,
as
they
were
destined destine%2:32:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
for
the
rest
of
the
weekend
,
by
about
half
an
hour
-
they
could
see see%2:39:00::
on
the
numerous
scoreboards
spotted spot%2:39:00::
around
the
course
that
Rosburg
,
who
ended end%2:42:00::
with
a
73
,
was
not
having have%2:39:06::
a
good_day
.
As
Player
began begin%2:36:00::
his
second
round
in
a
twosome
with
amateur
Bill_Hyndman
,
his
share
of
the
gallery
was be%2:42:03::
not
conspicuously
large
for
a
contender
.
Player
began begin%2:36:00::
with
a
birdie
on
the
first
hole
,
added add%2:30:00::
five
straight
pars
and_then
another
birdie
at
the
9
th
.
On
the
back
nine
he
began begin%2:30:00::
to
acquire acquire%2:40:00::
the
tidal_wave
of
a
gallery
that
stayed stay%2:42:02::
with
him
the
rest
of
the
tournament
.
He
birdied birdie%2:35:00::
the
13
th
,
the
15
th
and
the
18
th
-
five
birdies
,
one
bogey
and
12
pars
for
a
68
.
Starting start%2:42:00::
half
an
hour
behind
Player
in
company
with
British
Open_Champion_Kel_Nagle
,
Palmer
birdied birdie%2:35:00::
the
2
nd
,
the
9
th
,
the
13
th
and
the
16
th
-
four
birdies
,
one
bogey
and
13
pars
for
a
69
.
The
roar
of
Palmer
's
gallery
as
he
sank sink%2:38:02::
a
thrilling
putt
would
roll roll%2:39:00::
out
across
the
parklike
landscape
of
Augusta
,
only
to
be be%2:42:03::
answered answer%2:31:02::
moments
later
by
the
roar
of
Player
's
gallery
for
a
similar
triumph
.
At
one
point
late
in
the
day
,
when
Palmer
was
lining_up line_up%2:30:00::
a
25
-
foot
putt
on
the
16
th
,
a
thunderous
cheer
from
the
direction
of
the
18
th
green
unmistakably
announced announce%2:32:02::
that
Player
had
birdied birdie%2:35:00::
the
final
hole
.
Without
so_much
as
a
grimace
or
a
gesture
to
show show%2:39:00::
that
he
had
noticed notice%2:39:04::
(
although
he
later
admitted admit%2:32:00::
that
he
had
)
Palmer
proceeded proceed%2:32:00::
to
sink sink%2:38:02::
his
25
-
footer
,
and
his
gallery
sent send%2:38:01::
its
explosive
vocalization
rolling roll%2:42:00::
back
along
the
intervening
fairways
in_reply
.
Anyone
who
now
doubted doubt%2:31:00::
that
a
personal
duel
was be%2:42:03::
under_way
had
only
to
watch watch%2:39:05::
how
these
exceptionally
gifted
golfers
were
playing play%2:33:00::
this
most
difficult
golf_course
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
almost
axiomatic
that
golfers
who
dominate dominate%2:41:00::
the
game
of
golf
for
any
period_of_time
attack attack%2:33:01::
their
shots
with
a
vehemence
bordering_on border_on%2:42:00::
violence
.
The
bad_luck
that
can
so
often
mar mar%2:30:00::
a
well-played
round_of_golf
is
simply
overpowered overpower%2:33:00::
and
obliterated obliterate%2:30:02::
by
the
contemptuous
boldness
of
these
champions
.
Bob_Jones
played play%2:33:00::
that
way
.
Byron_Nelson
did
,
Hogan
did
.
And
last
week
at
the
Masters_Palmer
and
Player
did
.
As
the
third
round
of
the
tournament
began begin%2:42:00::
on
Saturday
and
the
duel
was
resumed resume%2:30:00::
in_earnest
,
it
was be%2:42:03::
Player
's
superior
aggressiveness
that
carried carry%2:35:02::
him
into
the
lead
.
This
day
Palmer
had
started start%2:42:00::
first
.
As
Player
stepped step%2:38:01::
on
the
first
tee
he
knew know%2:31:01::
that
Palmer
had
birdied birdie%2:35:00::
the
first
two
holes
and
already
was be%2:42:03::
2
under
par
for
the
day
.
Player
immediately
proceeded proceed%2:32:00::
to
follow_suit follow_suit%2:42:00::
.
In_fact
,
he
went_on go_on%2:32:00::
to
birdie birdie%2:35:00::
the
6
th
and
8
th
as_well
,
to
go go%2:41:00::
4
under
par
for
the
first
eight
holes
.
But
Player
's
real
test
came come%2:30:01::
on
the
ninth
hole
,
a
downhill
dogleg
to
the
left
measuring measure%2:30:00::
420
yards
.
He
hit hit%2:35:03::
a
poor
tee
shot
,
pulling pull%2:41:00::
it
off
into
the
pine
woods
separating separate%2:42:00::
the
9
th
and
first
fairways
.
Having
hit hit%2:35:03::
one
of
the
trees
,
