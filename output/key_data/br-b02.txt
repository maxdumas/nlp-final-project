So_far
as
the

is be%2:42:03::
concerned

the
Western
powers
have
not
acquiesced acquiesce%2:32:00::
and
should
not

so

Though
Walter_Ulbricht

The

protocol
of
September
12
,
1944

three
(

zones
for
occupation

Soviet

American

After
the
Berlin
blockade

the
Council

in
1949
declared declare%2:32:05::

For_some_time
the

distinction
between
the
Soviet

Germany
and
the
Soviet
sector
of
Berlin
by
promulgating promulgate%2:32:01::
separately

Then
they
moved move%2:38:01::

East_Berlin

began begin%2:30:00::
illegally

That
this
and
the
closing

have
not
been

by
the
Western

Britain

's
gratuitous
protest
over
a
visit
of
Chancellor_Adenauer

The
Chancellor
had have%2:40:04::
as
much
business

Ulbricht
had have%2:40:04::
in
East_Berlin
-
and
was be%2:42:03::
certainly
less
provocative
than
the
juvenile
sound-truck

of
Gerhard_Eisler

The_British
and
other
replies

There
remains remain%2:42:05::

A

Starting start%2:30:00::
with

the

apparently
is

to
break_down break_down%2:33:00::
the
anti-liquor
barriers
in

Probably
the
best
answer
to
this
kind_of
entering

is be%2:42:06::
congressional
action
requiring require%2:32:00::
the
Federal
Communications
Commission

such
advertising
through

power

The
National_Association

code
specifically
bars bar%2:32:00::

Past

popular
favor

Even

Why

then

with

is be%2:42:03::
it

Simply

The

State_Controller_Arthur_Levitt

that
he
has

the

those
of
Mr._Levitt
who
left leave%2:42:02::
an
impression

As
Mayor
,
Mr._Levitt
might
turn_out turn_out%2:42:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
more
independent
than
some
of

His
election

would
unquestionably
strengthen strengthen%2:30:01::

Mr._Wagner
might
or
might
not

a
``

''
Mayor
in_this
third
term
,
now
that
he
is be%2:42:03::
free_of

whom
he
calls call%2:32:02::
``

These
are be%2:42:06::
,
of_course

the

people

has

his

would

If

it

For
Mr._Kennedy
,
speaking speak%2:32:00::
softly
and
carrying carry%2:42:01::
a
sizable
stick
is
making make%2:36:00::
the
best
of
a
bad
situation
.
The
new
President
is be%2:42:03::
in
no
position
to
start_out start_out%2:30:00::
his
dealings
with
Moscow
by
issuing issue%2:32:01::
callable
bluffs

He
must
show show%2:31:00::
at
the
outset
that
he
means mean%2:31:00::
exactly
what
he
says say%2:32:00::
.
In_this
case
he
has
put put%2:32:00::
the
alternatives
clearly
to
Mr._Khrushchev
for
the
third
time
.
At
his
press_conference
Mr._Kennedy
said say%2:32:00::
,
``
All
we
want want%2:37:00::
in
Laos
is be%2:42:06::
peace
not
war

A
truly
neutral
government
not
a
cold_war
pawn
''
.
At
the
scene
he
has
just_as
clearly
shown show%2:39:00::
his
military
strength
in
unprovocative
but
ready
position
.
Since
Laos
is be%2:42:03::
of
no_more
purely
military
value
to
Moscow
itself
than
it
is be%2:42:03::
to
Washington
,
this
approach
might
be
expected expect%2:31:00::
to
head_off head_off%2:41:00::
Mr._Khrushchev
for_the_moment
.
But
because
of
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
military
situation
in
Laos
,
the
Soviet
leader
must
be be%2:42:03::
tempted
to
let let%2:41:00::
things
ride ride%2:42:00::
-
a
course
that
would
appear appear%2:39:00::
to
cost cost%2:42:01::
him
little
on_the_spot
,
but
would
bog bog%2:30:00::
Washington
in
a
tactical
mess
.
As
wars
go
,
Laos
is be%2:42:03::
an
extremely
little
one
.
Casualties
have
been
running run%2:42:04::
about
a
dozen
men
a
day
.
The
hard
core
of
the
pro-Communist
rebel
force
numbers number%2:42:00::
only
some
2000
tough
Viet_Minh
guerrilla
fighters
.
But
for
the
United_States
and
its
SEATO
allies
to
attempt attempt%2:36:00::
to
shore_up shore_up%2:35:00::
a

by

planners

But
if
anything
can
bring_home bring_home%2:30:00::
to
Mr._Khrushchev
the
idea
that
he
will
not
really
get get%2:39:00::
much
enjoyment
from
watching watch%2:39:05::
this
Braddock-against-the-Indians
contest
,
it
will
probably
be be%2:42:06::
the
fact
that
SEATO
forces
are be%2:42:03::
ready
to
attempt attempt%2:36:00::
it
-
plus
the
fact
that
Moscow
has have%2:40:00::
something
to
lose lose%2:40:02::
from
closing_off close_off%2:42:00::
disarmament
and
other
bigger
negotiations
with
Washington

Fortunately
both
the
Republicans
and
America
's
chief
Western
allies
now
are
joined join%2:35:00::
behind
the
neutral
Laos
aim
of
the
President
.
Actually
it
would
be be%2:42:03::
more
accurate
to
say say%2:32:00::
that
the
leader
of
the
alliance
now
has
swung swing%2:41:01::
fully
behind
the_British
policy
of
seeking seek%2:40:00::
to
achieve achieve%2:41:00::
a
neutral
Laos
via
the
international
bargaining
table
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
ironic
that
Washington
is
having have%2:42:05::
to
struggle struggle%2:33:00::
so
for
a
concept
that
for
six
years
it
bypassed bypass%2:32:00::
as
unreasonable
.
The
State_Department
tacitly
rejected reject%2:40:00::
the
neutral
Laos
idea
after
the
Geneva
conference
of
1954
,
and
last
year
Washington
backed back%2:41:01::
the
rightist
coup
that
ousted oust%2:41:00::
neutral
Premier_Souvanna_Phouma
.
But
since
last
fall
the
United_States
has
been
moving move%2:30:00::
toward
a
pro-neutralist
position
and
now
is be%2:42:03::
ready
to
back back%2:41:01::
the_British
plan
for
a
cease-fire
patrolled patrol%2:41:00::
by
outside
observers
and
followed follow%2:42:00::
by
a
conference
of
interested
powers
.
The
road
to
a
guaranteed-neutral
,
coup-proof
Laos
is be%2:42:03::
today
almost
as
difficult
as
warfare
on_that
nation
's
terrain
.
But
for
the
safety
of
Southeast_Asia
,
and
for
the
sake
of
the
Laotian
people
