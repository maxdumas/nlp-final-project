Eight
,
nine
steps
above
him
,
Roberts
had
paused pause%2:42:00::
.
Mickey
paused pause%2:42:00::
with
him
,
waiting wait%2:42:00::
,
no_longer
impatient
,
trying try%2:41:00::
now
to
think think_out%2:31:00::
it
out
,
do do%2:41:01::
a_little
planning
.
He
looked look%2:39:00::
down
over
the
banister
at
the
hotel
desk
,
with
the
telephone
and
pen
set
.
If
I
could
call_in call_in%2:32:00::
,
they
could
check check%2:31:02::
the
story
while
we
were be%2:42:03::
on
our
way
.
I
would
n't
have_to
tell tell%2:32:00::
them
I
had have%2:40:00::
Roberts
-
Then
he
heard hear%2:39:00::
it
,
like
a
muffled
thud
,
felt feel%2:39:00::
a
subtle
change
in
air_pressure
.
He
glanced glance%2:39:00::
up
in_time
to
see see%2:39:00::
Roberts
hurtling hurtle%2:38:00::
down
on
him
from
above
,
literally
flying fly%2:38:00::
through
the
air
,
his
bloody
face
twisted
.
Mickey
tried try%2:41:00::
to
flatten flatten%2:30:01::
against
the
banister
,
gripped grip%2:35:03::
it
with
one
hand
,
but
Roberts
'
full
weight
struck strike%2:35:00::
him
at
that
moment
in
the
groin
.
He
gasped gasp%2:29:00::
for
air
and
the
impact
tore tear%2:35:00::
his
hand
from
the
rail
.
He
tumbled tumble%2:38:00::
with
Roberts
,
helpless
and
in
agony
,
over_and_over
,
down
the
steps
.
By
a
wrenching
effort
,
he
managed manage%2:41:09::
to
hunch hunch%2:38:00::
and
draw_in draw_in%2:35:03::
,
to
take take%2:39:00::
the
final
fall
on
his
back
and
shoulders
rather_than
his
head
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
fuzzy
in
his
mind
and
,
for
a
moment
,
helpless
on
the
lobby
floor
,
but
he
was be%2:42:03::
conscious
,
and
free_of
the
weight
of
Roberts
'
body
.
When
his
vision
cleared clear%2:30:02::
he
saw see%2:39:00::
the
taller
one
scrambling scramble%2:38:00::
upward
,
reaching reach%2:35:00::
.
Mickey
was be%2:42:03::
on
his
knees
when
Roberts
turned turn%2:38:00::
on
the
stairs
and
the
razor
flashed flash%2:39:00::
in
his
hand
.
He
felt feel%2:39:10::
his
empty
pocket
and
knew know%2:31:01::
that
Roberts
had
retrieved retrieve%2:40:00::
the
only
weapon
at_hand
.
Mickey
's
eyes
fixed fix%2:30:00::
on
the
other
's
feet
,
which
would
first
betray betray%2:32:01::
the
moment
and
direction
of
an
attack
.
He
rose rise%2:38:05::
stiffly
,
forcing force%2:35:00::
his
knees
to
lock lock%2:30:00::
.
The
knifelike
pain
in
his
groin
nearly
brought bring%2:35:04::
him
down
again
.
He
made make%2:30:00::
himself
back_off back_off%2:38:00::
slowly
,
his
eyes
wary
on
Roberts
,
who
now
had have%2:40:00::
no_more
to
lose lose%2:40:02::
than
he
.
The
pain
dulled dull%2:30:00::
as
he
moved move%2:38:03::
,
and
he
steadied steady%2:35:00::
inside
.
After
a
moment
he
extended extend%2:29:01::
one
hand
,
the
fingers
curled
.
``
Come_on
''
,
he
said say%2:32:00::
.
``
You
want want%2:37:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
that
big
a
fool
-
I
was
hoping hope%2:31:00::
for
this
''
.
Roberts
brushed brush%2:35:00::
at
his
eyes
with
his
free
hand
and
started start%2:30:00::
down
the
steps
.
He
held hold%2:35:00::
the
razor
well
out
to
one
side
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
invulnerable
to
attack
,
but
he
could
be
handled handle%2:41:03::
,
Mickey
knew know%2:31:01::
,
if
he
could
be
brought bring%2:35:04::
to
make make%2:41:00::
the
first
move
.
They
were be%2:42:05::
eight
feet
apart
when
Roberts
cleared clear%2:38:00::
the
last
step
.
Mickey
waited wait%2:42:00::
with
slack
arms
.
``
Any
time
,
Roberts
''
,
he
said say%2:32:00::
.
``
Or
would
it
be be%2:42:03::
easier
if
I
put put%2:35:05::
my
hands
in
my
pockets
''
?
The
taunt
was
lost lose%2:40:02::
on
Roberts
.
He
advanced advance%2:38:00::
slowly
,
directly
,
giving give%2:40:07::
no
hint
of
a
feint
to
either
side
.
He
was be%2:42:05::
just
short
of
arm
's
reach
when
he
stopped stop%2:38:00::
.
Mickey
backed_off back_off%2:38:00::
two
steps
,
forcing force%2:36:00::
him
to
come_on come_on%2:38:00::
again
.
There
was be%2:42:04::
a
fixed
grin
on
Roberts
'
face
,
made make%2:30:00::
hideous
by
the
swollen
nose
and
the
smeared
blood
.
Mickey
backed_off back_off%2:38:00::
again
and
Roberts
hesitated hesitate%2:42:00::
,
then
came come%2:38:00::
along
.
They
moved move%2:38:03::
in
a
series
of
rhythmic
fits
and
starts
,
a
macabre
dance
-
two
steps
back
,
two
steps
forward
,
two
steps
back
.
Mickey
felt feel%2:39:00::
his
shoulders
come_up come_up%2:38:02::
against
the
wall
beside
the
heavy
slab
front_door
.
This
was
going_to
be be%2:42:03::
it
now
,
any
second
,
and
what
he
had
to
remember remember%2:31:01::
was be%2:42:06::
to
keep keep%2:42:00::
his
eye
on
the
razor
,
no_matter
what
,
even
if
Roberts
should
feint feint%2:36:00::
with
a
kick
to
the
groin
,
the
deadly
hand
was be%2:42:06::
his
exclusive
concern
.
The
kick
came come%2:30:01::
,
sudden
and
vicious
but
short
.
Mickey
's
guts
twisted twist%2:35:02::
with
the
effort
,
but
he
kept keep%2:42:00::
his
eye
on
the
weapon
.
It
moved move%2:38:03::
in
a
silver
arc
toward
his
throat
,
then
veered veer%2:38:00::
downward
.
He
hunched hunch%2:38:00::
his
left
shoulder
into
it
and
slashed slash%2:35:02::
at
Roberts
'
forearm
with
his
own
,
felt feel%2:39:00::
the
blade
slide slide%2:38:01::
off
his
sleeve
.
Before
Roberts
could
move move%2:38:00::
inside
to
cut cut%2:35:07::
upward
toward
his
face
,
he
slammed slam%2:35:00::
his
right
fist
into
Roberts
'
belly
.
Roberts
sagged sag%2:38:00::
and
slashed slash%2:35:02::
at
him
wildly
.
Ducking duck%2:38:00::
,
Mickey
tripped trip%2:38:00::
and
fell fall%2:38:03::
to
one
side
,
landing land%2:38:00::
heavily
on
the
wood
floor
.
Then
Roberts
was be%2:42:03::
on
him
,
gasping gasp%2:29:00::
for
breath
and
for
a_couple_of
seconds
Mickey
lost lose%2:40:02::
sight
of
the
blade
.
He
felt feel%2:39:00::
it
rip rip%2:35:00::
at
the
side
of
his
jacket
and
a
momentary
sting
under
his
left
ribs
.
He
got get%2:30:02::
a
knee
up
into
Roberts
'
belly
,
used use%2:34:01::
both
hands
and
heaved heave%2:35:01::
him
clear
,
then
scrambled scramble%2:38:00::
to
his
feet
.
They
were be%2:42:05::
in_the_center
of
the
lobby
now
.
Still
clutching clutch%2:35:00::
the
razor
,
Roberts
came_up come_up%2:38:03::
into
a
crouch
,
shaking shake%2:38:00::
his
head
.
When
he
charged charge%2:38:00::
Mickey
was be%2:42:03::
ready
.
He
hit hit%2:35:00::
Roberts
with
his
left
fist
in
the
ribs
and
the
razor
cut cut%2:38:08::
toward
him
feebly
,
then
wobbled wobble%2:38:00::
in
mid-air
.
With
his
right
fist
,
and
nearly
all
his
weight
behind
it
,
he
smashed smash%2:35:00::
at
the
bloodstained
face
.
Roberts
careened careen%2:38:01::
backward
,
his
back
arched
,
fought fight%2:41:00::
for
balance
and
,
failing fail%2:41:00::
,
stumbled stumble%2:38:01::
against
the
newel_post
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
.
The
sound
of
his
head
striking strike%2:35:01::
the
solid
wood
was be%2:42:06::
an
ultimate
,
sudden-end
sound
.
He
fell fall%2:38:03::
on
his
side
across
the
lowest
step
,
rolled_over roll_over%2:38:00::
once
,
then
lay lie%2:35:00::
still
.
Mickey
found find%2:39:02::
himself
leaning_against lean_against%2:35:00::
the
desk
,
with
stiff
hands
,
panting pant%2:29:00::
for
breath
.
After
a
minute
he
went go%2:38:00::
to
Roberts
,
looked look%2:39:00::
at
one
of
his
eyes
and
felt feel%2:35:01::
for
a
pulse
.
He
could
n't
feel feel%2:35:01::
any
.
Roberts
appeared appear%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
dead
;
if_not
yet
,
then
soon
,
very
soon
.
Suddenly
it
was be%2:42:03::
cold
in
the
lobby
.
It
seemed seem%2:39:01::
to
him
that
a
long_time
had
passed pass%2:42:00::
before
he
decided decide%2:31:00::
what
to
do do%2:41:01::
.
Actually
it
was be%2:42:06::
no_more_than
eight
or
ten
minutes
,
and
the
sum
of
his
reasoning
came come%2:42:11::
to
this
:
There
's
no
way
to
take take%2:38:09::
him
in
now
and
keep keep%2:41:01::
those
other
two
-
Wister
and
the
one
who
hired hire%2:41:00::
the
two
of
them
-
from
finding_out find_out%2:31:00::
about
Roberts
and
lamming lam%2:38:00::
out
.
The
local
law
here
would
hold hold%2:35:03::
me
till
they
check check%2:31:00::
clear
back
home
,
and
maybe
more_than
that
.
They
would
have have%2:42:05::
to
.
By
then
they
could
never
catch_up_with catch_up_with%2:33:00::
the
others
.
There
's
no
other
way
;
I
'll
have have%2:42:05::
to
do
it
myself
.
He
looked look%2:39:00::
at
where
Roberts
lay lie%2:42:00::
sprawled
on
the
step
.
Mickey
was be%2:42:03::
sure
now
he
was be%2:42:03::
dead
.
One
thing
,
he
thought think%2:31:00::
,
nobody
knows know%2:31:01::
about
it
yet
.
Only
me
.
He
climbed climb%2:38:00::
the
stairs
,
went_into go_into%2:38:00::
Roberts
'
room
,
found find%2:40:02::
a
suitcase
and
packed pack%2:35:00::
as
much
into
it
as
he
could
.
He
left leave%2:40:00::
a_few
things
.
It
did
n't
have_to
be be%2:42:03::
perfect
.
Roberts
was be%2:42:06::
a
wastrel
.
Walking walk%2:38:00::
away
on
impulse
,
he
might
logically
leave_behind leave_behind%2:40:01::
what
it
was be%2:42:03::
inconvenient
to
carry carry%2:35:02::
.
When
he
had
closed close%2:35:00::
the
suitcase
he
found find%2:40:02::
a
rag
and
moved move%2:38:03::
about
the
room
,
wiping wipe%2:35:00::
carefully
everything
he
might
have
touched touch%2:35:00::
.
It
took take%2:40:06::
him
nearly
an
hour
.
He
went_to go_to%2:38:00::
the
room
he
had
rented rent%2:41:01::
and
got_into get_into%2:29:00::
his
overcoat
.
He
left leave%2:40:00::
the
rest
of
his
things
and
returned return%2:38:00::
to
the
lobby
.
He
set set%2:35:00::
Roberts
'
suitcase
near
the
front_door
,
went go%2:38:00::
outside
and
walked walk%2:38:00::
back
to
the
garage
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
mildly
surprised
to
find find%2:39:01::
it
was
snowing snow%2:43:00::
.
It
snowed snow%2:43:00::
softly
,
silently
,
an
undulating
interruption
of
his
vision
against
the
night
sky
.
He
could
feel feel%2:39:00::
it
on
his
face
and
in
his
hair
.
He
found find%2:40:00::
the
key
to
the
Jeep
,
got get%2:30:02::
it
started start%2:38:01::
and
warmed warm_up%2:41:00::
it
up
for
five
minutes
.
Then
he
backed_out back_out%2:38:00::
and
swung swing%2:38:02::
around
to
the
front
drive
.
He
went_into go_into%2:38:00::
the
hotel
and
searched search%2:35:00::
till
he
found find%2:40:00::
the
razor
.
He
put put%2:35:00::
it
in
his
own
pocket
for
safekeeping
.
He
took take%2:38:10::
the
suitcase
out
to
the
Jeep
and
put put%2:35:00::
it
in
the
front
seat
.
Then
he
went_back go_back%2:38:00::
for
Roberts
.
The
body
was be%2:42:03::
heavier
than
he
had
anticipated anticipate%2:32:00::
.
He
got get%2:30:02::
it
onto
his
shoulder
after
some
work
and
carried carry%2:35:02::
it
outside
and
down
to
the
Jeep
.
He
dumped dump%2:40:00::
it
into
the
back
and
made make%2:36:00::
sure
it
would
n't
roll roll%2:38:00::
out
,
then
returned return%2:38:00::
to
the
porch
and
closed close%2:35:00::
the
front_door
,
making make%2:36:00::
sure
it
was be%2:42:03::
unlocked
.
He
drove drive%2:38:00::
carefully
in
the
direction
of
the
brief
tour
they
had
taken take%2:39:00::
earlier
.
It
snowed snow%2:43:00::
continuously
,
but
quietly
,
evenly
.
When
he
reached reach%2:38:01::
the
dip
in
the
woods
,
he
saw see%2:31:02::
that
already
the
earlier
ruts
were be%2:42:03::
barely
discernible
.
The
Jeep
fought fight%2:33:01::
its
way
through
the
low
spot
and
got get%2:30:00::
onto
higher
ground
.
He
drove drive%2:38:00::
in
low_gear
to
the
fork
in
the
road
and
swung swing%2:38:02::
as_close_as
possible
to
the
entrance
to
the
abandoned
mine
.
He
parked park%2:38:00::
facing face%2:42:00::
it
and
left leave%2:30:02::
the
headlights
on
,
but
when
he
started start%2:38:02::
into
the
tunnel
with
the
suitcase
,
he
found find%2:39:02::
the
illumination
extended extend%2:42:03::
no
farther
than
half_a_dozen
feet
into
the
passage
.
He
went_back go_back%2:38:00::
and
got get%2:35:03::
the
flashlight
,
returned return%2:38:00::
to
the
tunnel
and
carried carry%2:35:02::
the
suitcase
to
the
edge
of
the_pit
he
had
found find%2:40:02::
earlier
.
He
tossed toss%2:35:04::
the
bag
into
the_pit
and
watched watch%2:39:05::
dry
dust
spray spray%2:35:00::
up
around
it
.
When
the
dust
settled settle%2:38:01::
,
he
went_back go_back%2:38:00::
to
the
Jeep
and
carefully
worked work%2:38:02::
Roberts
'
body
onto
his
shoulder
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
n't
like
carrying carry%2:35:02::
the
suitcase
.
The
soft
snow
was be%2:42:03::
deceitful
underfoot
.
Twice
he
nearly
fell fall%2:38:00::
.
Inside
the
passage
,
he
had have%2:42:05::
to
work work%2:38:00::
his
way
over
the
fallen
timber
and
nearly
collapsed collapse%2:29:00::
under
his
clumsy
burden
.
By
the
time
he
reached reach%2:38:01::
the
edge
of
the_pit
he
was
panting pant%2:29:00::
and
his
shoulder
and
back
ached ache%2:39:00::
under
the
drag
of
the
dead
weight
.
He
stood stand%2:35:00::
looking look%2:39:00::
down
for
a_few
seconds
,
then
backed_up back_up%2:38:00::
two
or
three
paces
from
the
edge
.
There
was be%2:42:03::
too_much
weight
casually
to
toss toss%2:35:04::
it
away
.
He
could
feel feel%2:39:00::
himself
falling fall%2:38:03::
in
with
it
and
being be%2:42:03::
unable
to
get_out get_out%2:38:01::
.
It
would
be be%2:42:06::
a
bad
place
to
die die%2:30:00::
.
It
was be%2:42:06::
a
bad
place
for
Roberts
to
wind_up wind_up%2:30:02::
,
but
Roberts
had
asked_for ask_for%2:37:00::
it
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
too
late
to
worry worry%2:37:12::
about
that
.
He
knelt kneel%2:35:00::
slowly
and
dumped dump%2:40:00::
the
corpse
onto
the
floor
of
the
tunnel
.
It
was be%2:42:06::
a
relief
to
get_rid_of get_rid_of%2:40:01::
the
weight
.
He
was
shaking shake%2:29:00::
with
tension
and
it
took take%2:40:06::
him
a_couple_of
minutes
to
get
his
breath
and
settle settle%2:30:05::
down
.
Then
he
got get%2:30:00::
on
his
knees
and
rolled roll%2:38:00::
Roberts
'
body
toward
the
edge
.
It
hung hang%2:35:03::
momentarily
on
the
point
of
dropping drop%2:38:00::
off
.
He
gave
it
a
strong
push
,
heard hear%2:39:00::
it
slide slide%2:38:01::
,
then
tumble tumble%2:38:00::
dryly
into
the
hole
.
He
got get%2:30:00::
to
his
feet
and
threw throw%2:36:02::
the
flashlight
beam
into
the_pit
.
The
body
lay lie%2:35:00::;2:42:00::
in
an
awkward
sprawl
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
below
the
level
of
the
tunnel
floor
.
Deep
enough
,
he
decided decide%2:31:00::
.
There
was
little
chance
anyone
would
enter enter%2:38:00::
this
shaft
during
the
winter
.
The
external
signs
of
his
approach
to_it
would
be
covered cover%2:35:00::
by
the
snow
,
probably
by
the
next
day
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
n't
cold
enough
in
the
tunnel
to
preserve preserve%2:30:00::
the
body
intact
.
By
spring
it
would
be be%2:42:06::
a
skeleton
.
He
made make_one's_way%2:38:00::
his
way
back
to
the
Jeep
.
He
had
started start%2:30:00::
to
back back%2:38:00::
into
the
turn
when
he
remembered remember%2:31:00::
the
razor
in
his
pocket
.
He
climbed_down climb_down%2:38:00::
,
went_back go_back%2:38:00::
into
the
tunnel
and
tossed toss%2:35:04::
the
razor
into
the_pit
.
It
landed land%2:38:00::
on
Roberts
'
sprawled
right
thigh
,
poised poise%2:38:00::
precariously
,
then
slid slide%2:38:01::
off
to
the
ground
.
He
went_back go_back%2:38:00::
once_more
to
the
Jeep
and
started start%2:30:01::
the
short
drive
to
the
hotel
.
In
the
garage
he
checked check%2:31:00::
the
Jeep
for
signs
of
the
use
he
had
made make%2:30:00::
of_it
.
There
were
stains
here_and_there
and
he
cleaned clean%2:35:00::
them
off
,
using use%2:34:01::
an
oiled
rag
he
found find%2:40:02::
on
a
nail
.
He
wiped wipe%2:35:00::
the
steering_wheel
and
all
the
places
he
might
have
touched touch%2:35:00::
the
Jeep
.
He
replaced replace%2:35:00::
the
flashlight
where
it
had
been
stowed stow%2:35:00::
,
got get%2:30:00::
into
his
own
car
and
backed back%2:38:00::
it
out
of
the
garage
.
There
were be%2:42:05::
tire
marks
where
it
had
been be%2:42:05::
,
but
they
were
overlapped overlap%2:42:03::
by
others
and
on
the
dusty
floor
would
not
be be%2:42:03::
noticeable
except
under
close
scrutiny
.
Liz_Peabody
,
he
thought think%2:31:00::
,
might
spend spend%2:42:00::
some
time
grieving grieve%2:37:00::
for
her
lost
lover
,
but
he
doubted doubt%2:31:00::
that
she
would
launch launch%2:36:00::
an
investigation
.
He
judged judge%2:31:00::
her
to
be be%2:42:06::
a
woman
of
some
pride
,
though
not_much
sense
.
Still
she
would
probably
have have%2:40:00::
sense
enough
not
to
call_in call_in%2:41:00::
the
local
sheriff
to
find find%2:40:00::
her
boy
friend
who
,
apparently
,
had
run_away run_away%2:38:00::
.
