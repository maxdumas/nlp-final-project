She
was be%2:42:06::
the

as
the

was be%2:42:03::
the
ancient

If

it
was
to

that
she
was

by
a

of

Which
was be%2:42:06::

It
had
required require%2:42:00::
the
approval

President
Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt

the
John_Harvey

be
loaded load%2:35:01::
with
100
tons
of

For
in
a
world
as_yet
unacquainted_with
the
horrors
of
the
mushroom_cloud
,
poison_gas
was
still
regarded_as regard_as%2:31:00::
the
ultimate
in
hideous
weapons
.
Throughout
the
early
years
of
World_War
2
,
,
reports
persisted persist%2:42:00::
that
the
Axis
powers
had
used use%2:34:01::
gas
-
Germany
in
Russia
,
Japan
in
China
again
.
They
were
always
denied deny%2:32:00::

Influential

Some
extremists
went go%2:41:00::
so_far
as
to
urge urge%2:32:00::

it
first
.
To
silence silence%2:30:00::
extremists
,
to
warn warn%2:32:00::
the
Axis
,
President_Roosevelt
issued issue%2:32:01::
this
statement
for
the
Allies
in
August
:
``
From_time_to_time
since
the

there
have

I
have
been be%2:42:03::
loath
to
believe believe%2:31:00::
that
any
nation

even

``
However
,
evidence
that
the
Axis

are
making
significant
preparations

such
an

being
reported report%2:32:00::
with

``
Use

''
.
The
following
month
the
invasion
of
Italy
was
begun begin%2:30:01::
,
and
Roosevelt
gave
effect
to
his
warning
by
consenting consent%2:32:00::
to
the
stockpiling
of
poison_gas
in
southern
Italy
.
Bari
was
chosen choose%2:31:00::
as
a
depot
,
not_only
for
its
seeming
safety
,
but
because
of
its
proximity
to
airfields
.
Any
retaliatory
gas
attack
would
be be%2:42:03::
airborne
.
It
would
be
made make%2:41:00::
in
three
waves
-
the
first
to
lay_down lay_down%2:31:00::
a
smokescreen
,
the
second
to
drop drop%2:38:01::
the
gas
bombs
,
the
third
to
shower shower%2:35:00::
incendiaries
which
would
burn burn%2:30:02::
everything
below
.
So
the
vile
cargo
went_into go_into%2:38:00::
the
hole
of
the
John_Harvey
.
A
detachment
of
six
men
from
the
701
st
Chemical_Maintenance_Company
under
First_Lt._Howard_D._Beckstrom
went go%2:38:00::
aboard
,
followed follow%2:38:00::
by
Lt._Thomas_H._Richardson
,
the
Cargo_Security_Officer
.
Secrecy
was be%2:42:03::
paramount
.
Only
a_few
other
people
-
very
important
people
-
knew know%2:31:01::
of
the
nitrogen-mustard
eggs
nestled nestle%2:35:00::
below
decks
.
No
one
else
must
know know%2:31:01::
.
Thus
,
in
the
immemorial
way
-
in
the
way
of
the
right_hand
that
knows know%2:31:01::
and
the
left
that
does
not
-
was
the
stage
set set%2:30:09::
for
tragedy
at
Bari
.
It
was be%2:42:06::
the
night
of
December
2
,
1943
,
and
it
was
growing grow%2:30:03::
dark
in
Bari
.
It
was
getting_on get_on%2:38:02::
toward
7
o
'
clock
and
the
German
Me-210
plane
had
been be%2:42:04::
and
gone go%2:38:00::
on
its
eighth
straight
visit
.
Capt._A._B._Jenks
of
the
Office
of
Harbor_Defense
was be%2:42:03::
very
worried
.
He
knew know%2:31:01::
that
German
long-range
bombers
had
been
returning return%2:38:00::
to
the
attack
in
Italy
.
On
November
24
th
,
they
had
made make%2:41:00::
a
raid
on
La_Maddalena
.
Two
days
later
,
some
30
of
them
had
struck strike%2:33:00::
at
a
convoy
off
Bougie
,
sinking sink%2:38:02::
a
troopship
-
and
it
had
been
that
very
night
that
the
Me-210
had
made
its
first_appearance
.
After
it
had
reappeared reappear%2:30:00::
the
next
two
nights
,
Jenks
went_to go_to%2:38:00::
higher
headquarters
and
said say%2:32:00::
:
``
For
three
days
now
a
German
reconnaissance
plane
has
been be%2:42:05::
over
the
city
taking take%2:32:02::
pictures
.
They
're
just
waiting wait%2:42:01::
for
the
proper
time
to
come come%2:38:00::
over_here
and
dump dump%2:40:00::
this
place
into
the
Adriatic
''
.
But
the
older
and
wiser
heads
had
dismissed dismiss%2:32:00::
his
warning
as
alarmist
.
Even_though
it
was
known know%2:31:01::
that
the
Luftwaffe
in_the_north
was
now
being
directed direct%2:41:00::
by
the
young
and
energetic
General_Peltz
,
the
commander
who
would
conduct conduct%2:41:00::
the
``
Little_Blitz
''
on
London
in
1944
,
a
major
raid
on
Bari
at
this
juncture
of
the
war
was
not
to
be
considered consider%2:31:00::
seriously
.
True
,
there
had
been be%2:42:04::
raids
on
Naples
-
but
Naples
was be%2:42:05::
pretty
far
north
on
the
opposite
coast
.
No
,
Bari
was be%2:42:05::
out
of
range
.
More_than
that
,
Allied
air
had have%2:40:00::
complete
superiority
in
the
Eighth_Army
's
sector
.
So
Captain_Jenks
returned return%2:38:00::
to
his
harbor
post
to
watch watch%2:41:00::
the
scouting
plane
put_in put_in%2:42:00::
five
more
appearances
,
and
to
feel feel%2:37:00::
the
certainty
of_this
dread
rising rise%2:30:02::
within
him
.
For
Jenks
knew know%2:31:01::
that
Bari
's
defenses
were
made make%2:36:00::
of
paper
.
The
Royal
Air_Force
had have%2:40:00::
but
a
single
light
anti-aircraft
squadron
and
two
balloon
units
available
.
There
were be%2:42:04::
no
R._A._F.
fighter
squadrons
on
Bari
airfield
.
The
radar
station
with
the
best
location
was be%2:42:03::
still
not
serviceable
.
Telephone
communication
was be%2:42:03::
bad
.
And
everywhere
in_evidence
among
the
few
remaining
defensive
units
was be%2:42:03::
that
old
handmaiden
of
disaster
-
multiple
command
.
It
had
been
made make%2:36:00::
shockingly
evident
that
very
morning
to
Ensign_Kay_K._Vesole
,
in
charge
of
the
armed
guard
aboard
the
John_Bascom
.
A
British
officer
had
come come%2:38:04::
aboard
and
told tell%2:32:02::
him
that
in_case

enemy
air_attack
he
was
not
to
open_fire open_fire%2:33:00::
until
bombs
were
actually
dropped drop%2:38:01::
.
Then
he
was
to
co-ordinate coordinate%2:41:00::
his
fire fire%2:33:01::
with
a
radar-controlled
shore
gun
firing fire%2:33:02::
white
tracers
.
``
This
harbor
is be%2:42:03::
a
bomber

paradise

,
the
Britisher
had
said say%2:32:00::
with
frank
grimness
.
``
It
's

Vesole

Not

What
would
his

then
-
the
North_Star

Ensign_Vesole
decided decide%2:31:00::
that
he
would
not
tarry tarry%2:42:00::
until
he
heard hear%2:39:00::
the
whispering
of
the
bombs
,
and
when
night
began begin%2:30:00::
to
fall fall%2:30:00::
,
he
put put%2:35:05::
Seaman

/
c
Donald_L._Norton
and
Seaman
1

c
William_A._Rochford
on
the
guns

told tell%2:32:02::
them
to
start start%2:30:00::
shooting shoot%2:33:00::
the
moment
they
saw see%2:39:00::
an

Below

Seaman

Stanley_Bishop
had
begun begin%2:30:00::
to

a

Above
decks
on
the
John_Harvey
,
Lieutenant_Richardson
gazed gaze%2:39:00::
at
the
lights
still
burning burn%2:43:01::
on
the
port
wall
and
felt feel%2:37:00::
uneasy
.
There
were be%2:42:04::
lights
glinting glint%2:39:00::
in
the
city
,
too
,
even_though
it
was
now
dark
enough
for
a_few
stars
to
become become%2:30:00::
visible
.
Bari
was
asking_for_it
,
he
thought think%2:31:01::
.
For
five
days
now
,
they
had
been be%2:42:05::
in
port
and
that
filthy
stuff
was be%2:42:05::
still
in
the
hold
.
Richardson
wondered wonder%2:31:00::
when
it
would
be
unloaded unload%2:35:02::
.
He
hoped hope%2:37:01::
they
would
put put%2:35:00::
it
somewhere
way
,
way
down
in
the
earth
.
The
burden
of
his
secret
was
pressing_down_on press_down_on%2:35:00::
him
,
as
it
was_on
Lieutenant_Beckstrom
and
his
six
enlisted_men
.
Lieutenant_Richardson
could
envy envy%2:37:01::
the
officers
and
men
of
the
John_Harvey
in
their
innocent
assumption
that
the
ship
contained contain%2:42:13::
nothing
more
dangerous
than
high_explosive
bombs
.
They
seemed seem%2:39:00::
happy
at
the
delay
in
unloading
,
glad
at
the
chance
to
go go%2:38:00::
ashore
in
a
lively
liberty
port
such_as
Bari
.
Nine
of
them
had
gone go%2:38:00::
down
the
gangplank
already
.
Deck_Cadet_James_L._Cahill
and
Seaman_Walter_Brooks
had
been be%2:42:03::
the
first
to
leave leave%2:38:01::
.
Richardson
had
returned return%2:40:08::
their
departing
grins
with
the
noncommittal
nod
that
is be%2:42:03::
the
security
officer
's
stock
in
trade
.
The
other
half
of
the
crew
,
plus
Beckstrom
and
his
men
,
had
remained remain%2:42:03::
aboard
.
Richardson
glanced glance%2:39:00::
to
sea
and
started start%2:38:04::
slightly
.
Damned
if
that
was be%2:42:03::
n't
a
sailing_ship
standing_out stand_out%2:38:00::
of
the
old
harbor
-
Porto_Vecchio
.
The
night
was be%2:42:03::
so
clear
that
Richardson
had have%2:30:01::
no
difficulty
making_out make_out%2:39:00::
the
silhouette
.
Then
the
thought
of
a
cloudless
sky
made make%2:32:00::
him
shiver shiver%2:38:00::
,
and
he
glanced glance%2:39:00::
upward
.
His
eyes
boggled boggle%2:38:00::
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
a
clear
night
and
it
was
raining rain%2:43:00::
!
Capt._Michael_A._Musmanno
,
Military_governor
of
the
Sorrentine_Peninsula
,
had
also
seen see%2:39:00::
and
felt feel%2:39:00::
the
``
rain
''
.
But
he
had
mistaken mistake%2:31:02::
it
for
bugs
.
Captain_Musmanno
's
renovated
schooner
with
the
flamboyant
name
Unsinkable
had
just
left leave%2:38:01::
Porto_Vecchio
with
a
cargo
of
badly-needed
olive_oil
for
the
Sorrentine
's
civilian
population
.
Musmanno
was be%2:42:05::
on
deck
.
At
exactly
7
:
30
,
he
felt feel%2:39:00::
a
fluttering
object
brush brush%2:35:00::
his
face
.
He
snatched snatch%2:35:02::
at
it
savagely
.
He
turned turn%2:38:00::
the
beam
of
his
flashlight
on_it
.
He
laughed laugh%2:29:00::
.
It
was be%2:42:06::
the
silver
foil
from
the
chocolate_bar
he
had
been
eating eat%2:34:00::
.
He
frowned frown%2:29:00::
.
But
how
could
-
?
Another
,
longer
strip
of
tinsel
whipped whip%2:35:02::
his
mouth
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
two
feet
long
.
It
was be%2:42:06::
not
candy
wrapping
.
It
was be%2:42:06::
``
window
''
-
the
tinsel
paper
dropped drop%2:38:00::
by
bombers
to
jam jam%2:32:00::
radar

to
fill fill%2:30:01::
the
scope
with
hundreds
of
blips
that
would
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
approaching

``
Fermate

!
Musmanno
bellowed bellow%2:32:00::
to
his
Italian
crewmen
.
``
Stop stop%2:42:00::
!
Stop stop%2:42:00::

!
Unsinkable
slowed slow%2:30:00::
and
stopped stop%2:42:00::
,
hundreds
of
brilliant
white
flares
swayed sway%2:38:01::
eerily
down
from
the
black
,
the
air_raid
sirens
ashore
rose rise%2:30:02::
in
a
keening
shriek
,
the
anti-aircraft
guns
coughed

chattered

and
above
it
all
motors
roared roar%2:32:01::
and
the
bombs
came come%2:38:00::
whispering
and
wailing
and
crashing crash%2:38:02::
down
among
the
ships
at
anchor
at
Bari
.
They
had
come come%2:38:00::
from

,
these
hundred-odd
Junkers

They
had

they

by
complete
surprise
and
now
they
were
battering batter%2:35:01::
her

attacking attack%2:33:00::
with
deadly
skill

They
had
ruined ruin%2:35:00::
the

they
had
made make%2:30:00::
themselves

Most_of
