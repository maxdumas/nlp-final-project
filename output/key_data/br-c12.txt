Herr_Wangenheim
has
only
recently
become become%2:42:01::
the
city
's
music_director
,
and
is be%2:42:03::
a
young_man
with
a
clear
flair
for
the
podium
.
But
he
weighted weight%2:35:00::
the
Eighth_Symphony
,
at_times
,
with
a
shuddering
subjectivity
which
seemed seem%2:39:00::
considerably
at_odds
with
the
music
.
He
might
have
been
hoping hope%2:37:01::
,
to
all
appearances
,
that
this
relatively
sunny
symphony
,
in
conjunction
with
the
Choral_Fantasy
at
the
end
of
the
program
,
could
amount amount%2:42:00::
to
something
like
the
Ninth
;
but
no
amount
of
head-tossing
could
make make%2:41:00::
it
so
.
The
conductor
's
preoccupation
with
the
business
of
starting
and
stopping
caused cause%2:36:00::
occasional
raggedness
,
as
with
the
first
orchestra
entrance
in
the
Fourth_Piano_Concerto
,
but
when
he
put put%2:35:00::
his
deliberations
and
obsequies
aside
and
let let%2:41:00::
the
music
move move%2:38:00::
as
designed design%2:36:02::
,
it
did
so
with
plenty
of
spring
.
The
concerto
's
soloist
,
Hans_Richter-Haaser
,
played play%2:36:12::
with
compensatory
ease
and
economy
,
though
without
the

plasticity

Everybody

The

was be%2:42:03::
