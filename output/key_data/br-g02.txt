In_the_past

the
duties
of
the
state

as
Sir_Henry_Maine
noted note%2:32:00::
long_ago

were be%2:42:03::
only
two
in

Beyond
the
two
basic
tasks
mentioned mention%2:32:01::
above
,
no
attention
was
paid pay_attention%2:39:00::
by
statesman
or
scholar
to
an
idea
of
state
responsibility

either
internally

externally

This
was be%2:42:03::
particularly
true
in
the
world

,
which
was be%2:42:06::
an
anarchical
battleground

by
strife

avaricious
competition

colonial
empires

That
any

duty
was
owed owe%2:40:01::
by
his
nation

other
nations
would
have
astonished astonish%2:31:00::
a
nineteenth-century
statesman

His
duty
was be%2:42:03::
to
his

to
his
nation

and
an
extension

not

Thus
,
to
cite cite%2:32:00::

may
have
incidentally

At_the_same_time

all
suggestions

for

are be%2:42:03::
multiple
reasons

an
unannounced

nonetheless
readily
observable
shift
has

in
both
facets

A_little
more_than
twenty
years

the
American
people
turned turn%2:38:00::
an
important
corner
.
In_what
has
aptly
been be%2:42:06::
called call%2:32:00::
a
``
constitutional
revolution
''
,
the
basic
nature
of
government
was
transformed transform%2:30:03::
from
one
essentially
negative
in
nature
(
the
``
night-watchman
state
''
)
to
one
with
affirmative
duties
to
perform perform%2:36:00::

The
``
positive

''
came come%2:30:01::
into
existence
.
For
lawyers
,
reflecting reflect%2:39:00::
perhaps
their
parochial
preferences
,
there
has
been be%2:42:00::
a
special
fascination
since
then
in
the
role
played play%2:41:12::
by

the
imprimatur
of
judicial
approval
that
was
finally
placed place%2:35:00::
upon
social
legislation

Of
greater
importance
,
however
,
is be%2:42:06::
the
content
of
those
programs
,
which
have
had have%2:30:00::
and
are

enormous
consequences

been

has
become become%2:30:00::
a

and
all
the
many
facets
of
the
American
version
of
the
welfare_state
have
become become%2:30:00::
part
of
the
conventional
wisdom

A
national
consensus

near
unanimity
exists exist%2:42:00::
that

there
should
be be%2:42:00::

The
general
acceptance
of
the
idea
of
governmental
(
i.
e.
,
societal
)
responsibility
for
the
economic
well-being
of
the
American
people
is be%2:42:03::
surely
one
of
the
two
most
significant
watersheds
in
American
constitutional
history

The

,
of_course

was be%2:42:06::
the
Civil_War
,
the
conflict
which
a
century

insured insure%2:32:04::
national
unity

A
third
,
one
of
at_least
equal
and
perhaps
even
greater
importance
,
is
now
being
traversed traverse%2:38:00::
:
American
immersion

Internal

Nevertheless
,
it
may
be be%2:42:03::

one
example

as
will
be

it
cuts_across cut_across%2:42:00::
both
facets
of
the
new
concept

Thirty
years
ago
,
while
the
nation
was
wallowing wallow%2:34:01::
in
economic
depression
,
the
prevailing
philosophy
of
government
was be%2:42:03::
to
stand stand%2:42:04::
aside
and
allow allow%2:32:00::
``
natural

to

That

of
the
Hoover_Administration
fell fall%2:42:00::
to
the
siege

of
the
New_Deal
;
less_than
a
score
of
years
later
Congress
enacted enact%2:41:00::
the
Employment_Act
of
1946
,
by
which
the
national

assumed assume%2:40:01::
the
responsibility
of
taking take%2:41:04::
action
to

Hands-off
the
economy
was
replaced replace%2:41:00::
by
conscious
guidance
through
planning
-
the
economic
side
of
the
constitutional
revolution
.
In
1961
the
first
important
legislative
victory
of
the
Kennedy_Administration
came come%2:30:01::
when
the
principle
of
national
responsibility
for
local
economic
distress
won win%2:33:00::
out
over
a
``

payment
for
unemployment

by
nation-wide
taxation
rather_than
by
a
levy
only
on
those
states
afflicted
with
manpower

.
The
American
people
have
indeed
come come%2:30:03::
a
long
way
in
the
brief
interval
between
1930
and
1961
.
Internal
national
responsibility
is be%2:42:03::
a
societal
response
to
the
impact
of
the
Industrial_Revolution
.
Reduced reduce%2:30:06::
to
its
simplest
terms
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
an
assumption
of
a
collective
duty
to
compensate compensate%2:42:00::
IN
the
inability
of
individuals
to
cope_with cope_with%2:41:00::
the
rigors
of
the
era
.
National
responsibility
for
individual
welfare
is be%2:42:03::
a
concept
not
limited limit%2:41:00::
to
the
United_States
or
even
to
the
Western
nations
.
A
measure
of
its
widespread
acceptance
may
be
derived derive%2:31:00::
from
a
statement
of
the
International_Congress
of
Jurists
in
1959
.
Meeting meet%2:41:01::
in
New_Delhi
under
the
auspices
of
the
International_Commission
of
Jurists

body

the
Congress
redefined redefine%2:42:00::
and
expanded expand%2:30:02::
the
traditional
Rule_of_Law
to
include include%2:42:00::
affirmative
governmental
duties
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
noteworthy
that
the
majority
of
the
delegates
to
the
Congress
were be%2:42:03::
from
the
less
developed
,
former
colonial
nations
.
The
Rule_of_Law
,
historically
a
principle
according accord%2:40:00::
everyone
his
``
day
in
court
''
before
an
impartial
tribunal
,
was
broadened broaden%2:30:01::
substantively
by
making make%2:36:00::
it
a
responsibility
of
government
to
promote promote%2:41:01::
individual
welfare
.
Recognizing recognize%2:31:02::
that
the
Rule_of_Law
is be%2:42:03::
``
a
dynamic
concept

to

rights
of
the
individual

a
free

''
,
the
Congress
asserted assert%2:32:00::
that
it
also
included include%2:42:00::
the
responsibility
``
to

''
.
The
idea
of
national
responsibility
thus
has
become become%2:30:00::
a
common
feature
of
the
nations
of
the
non-Soviet
world
.
For
better
or
for
worse
,
we
all
now
live live%2:42:08::
in
welfare_states
,
the
organizing
principle
of_which
is be%2:42:03::
collective
responsibility
for
individual
well-being
.
Whether
a
concept
analogous
to
the
principle
of
internal
responsibility
operates operate%2:35:03::
in
a
nation
's
external
relations
is be%2:42:03::
less
obvious
and
more
difficult
to
establish establish%2:31:00::
.
The
hypothesis
ventured venture%2:32:00::
here
is be%2:42:03::
that
it
does
,
and
that
evidence
is
accumulating accumulate%2:30:00::
validating validate%2:31:00::
that
proposition
.
The
content
is be%2:42:03::
not
the
same
,
however
:
rather_than
individual
security
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
the
security
and
continuing
existence
of
an
``
ideological
group
''
-
those
in
the
``
free_world
''
-
that
is be%2:42:03::
basic
.
External
national
responsibility
involves involve%2:42:00::
a
burgeoning burgeon%2:30:01::
requirement
that
the
leaders
of
the
Western
nations
so
guide guide%2:38:01::
their
decisions
as
to
further further%2:41:01::
the
viability
of
other
friendly
nations
.
If
internal
responsibility
suggests suggest%2:32:03::
acceptance
of
the
socialist
ideal
of
equality
,
then
external
responsibility
implies imply%2:32:00::
adherence
to
principles
of
ideological
supranationalism
.
Reference_to
two
other
concepts
-
nationalism
and
sovereignty
-
may
help help%2:41:00::
to
reveal reveal%2:39:00::
the
contours
of
the
new
principle
.
In
its
beginnings
the
nation-state
had
to
struggle struggle%2:35:00::
to
assert assert%2:32:01::
itself
-
internally
,
against
feudal
groups
,
and
externally
,
against
the
power
and
influence
of
such
other
claimants
for
loyalty
as
the
Church
.
The
breakup
of
the
Holy_Roman_Empire
and
the
downfall
of
feudalism
led lead%2:32:00::
,
not
more_than
two
centuries
ago
,
to
the
surge
of
nationalism
.
(
Since
the
time-span
of
the
nation-state
coincides coincide%2:42:00::
roughly
with
the
separate
existence
of
the
United_States
as
an
independent
entity
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
perhaps
natural
for
Americans
to
think_of think_of%2:31:02::
the
nation
as
representative
of
the
highest
form
of
order
,
something
permanent
and
unchanging
.

The
concept
of
nationalism
is be%2:42:03::
the
political
principle
that
epitomizes epitomize%2:42:00::
and
glorifies glorify%2:32:00::
the
territorial
state
as
the
characteristic
type
of
socal
structure

But
it
is be%2:42:03::
more_than
that
.
For
it
includes include%2:42:00::
the
emotional

that
bind bind%2:41:01::

their
homeland
and
the
complex
motivations
that
hold hold%2:42:00::
a
large
group
of
people
together
as
a
unit
.
Today
,
as
new
nations
rise rise%2:42:00::
from
the
former
colonial
empires
,
nationalism
is be%2:42:03::
one
of
the
hurricane
forces
loose
in
the
world
.
Almost
febrile
in
intensity
,
the
principle
has
become become%2:30:00::
worldwide
in
application

unfortunately
at
the
very
time
that
nationalist
fervors
can
wreak wreak%2:36:00::
greatest
harm

Historically
,
however
,
the
concept
is be%2:42:03::
one
that

While

nationalism
has

are be%2:42:06::
other

)
It
is be%2:42:03::
one
of
the
ironic
quirks
of
history
that
the
viability
and
usefulness
of
nationalism
and
the
territorial
state

rapidly
dissipating dissipate%2:38:00::
at
precisely
the
time
that
the
nation-state
attained attain%2:38:00::
its
highest
number
(
approximately
100
)
.
But
it
is be%2:42:03::
more_than
irony
:
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
nationalism
is be%2:42:03::
no_longer

tenable
concept
is be%2:42:06::
because
it
has

throughout

In_other_words

Complementing complement%2:30:02::

In_fact
