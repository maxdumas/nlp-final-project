What
does
1961
offer offer%2:40:02::
in
political
and
governmental
developments
in
Mississippi
?
Even
for
those
who
have
been
observing observe%2:39:00::
the
political
scene
a
long_time
,
no
script
from
the
past
is be%2:42:03::
worth
very_much
in
gazing gaze%2:39:00::
into
the
state
's
immediate
political
future
.
This
is
largely
because
of
the
unpredictability
of
the
man
who
operates operate%2:35:00::
the
helm
of
the
state_government
and
is be%2:41:00::
the
elected
leader
of
its
two
million
inhabitants
-
Gov._Ross_Barnett
.
Barnett
,
who
came come%2:38:04::
into
office
with
no
previous
experience
in_public
administration
,
has
surrounded surround%2:42:00::
himself
with
confusion
which
not_only
keeps keep%2:42:07::
his
foes
guessing guess%2:32:00::
but
his
friends
as_well
.
Consequently
,
it
is
uncertain
after
nearly
12
months
in
office
just
which
direction
the
Barnett
administration
will
take take%2:40:15::
in
the
coming
year
.
Some
predict predict%2:32:00::
the
administration
will
settle_down settle_down%2:30:00::
during
1961
and
iron_out iron_out%2:30:00::
the
rough
edges
which
it
has
had have%2:42:00::
thus_far
.
The
builtin
headache
of
the
Barnett
regime
thus_far
has
been be%2:42:06::
the
steady
stream
of
job-seekers
and_others
who
feel feel%2:31:00::
they
were
given give%2:40:03::
commitments
by
Barnett
at
some
stage
of
his
eight-year
quest
for
the
governor
's
office
.
There
are be%2:42:00::
many
who
predict predict%2:32:00::
that
should
Barnett
decide decide%2:31:00::
to
call call%2:41:04::
the
Legislature
back
into
special
session
,
it
will
really
throw throw%2:35:00::
his
administration
into
a
scramble
.
Certainly
nobody
will
predict predict%2:32:00::
that
the
next
time
the
lawmakers
come_back come_back%2:38:00::
together
Barnett
will
be_able_to
enjoy enjoy%2:37:00::
a
re-enactment
of
the
strange
but
successful
``
honeymoon
''
he
had have%2:39:06::
in
the
1960
legislative
session
.
If
Barnett
does
n't
call call%2:41:04::
a
special
session
in
1961
,
it
will
be be%2:42:03::
the
first
year
in
the
last
decade
that
the
Legislature
has
not
met meet%2:41:00::
in
regular
or
special
session
.
The
odds
favor favor%2:31:00::
a
special
session
,
more_than
likely
early
in
the
year
.
Legislators
always
get get%2:30:00::
restless
for
a
special
session
(
whether
for
the
companionship
or
the
$
22.50
per_diem
is be%2:42:03::
not
certain
)
and
if
they
start start%2:30:00::
agitating agitate%2:41:00::
.
Barnett
is
not
expected expect%2:31:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
able
to
withstand withstand%2:42:00::
the
pressure
.
The
issue
which
may
make make%2:30:00::
it
necessary
to
have have%2:36:00::
a
session
is be%2:42:06::
the
highly_sensitive
problem
of
cutting cut%2:30:06::
the
state
's
congressional_districts
from
six
to
five
to
eliminate eliminate%2:30:01::
one
congressional
seat
.
With
eyes
focused_on focus_on%2:42:00::
the
third
congressional_district
,
the
historic
Delta
district
,
and
Congressman_Frank_E._Smith
as
the
one
most
likely
to
go go%2:30:08::
,
the
redistricting
battle
will
put put%2:35:05::
to
a
test
the
longstanding
power
which
lawmakers
from
the
Delta
have
held hold%2:42:00::
in
the
Legislature
.
Mississippi
's
relations
with
the
national
Democratic_party
will
be be%2:42:05::
at
a
crossroads
during
1961
,
with
the
first
Democratic
president
in
eight
years
in
the
White_House
.
Split split%2:38:00::
badly
during
the
recent
presidential
election
into
almost
equally
divided
camps
of
party
loyalists
and
independents
,
the
Democratic_party
in
Mississippi
is be%2:42:03::
currently
a
wreck
.
And
there
has
been be%2:42:04::
no
effort
since
the
election
to
pull pull%2:35:00::
it
back
together
.
Barnett
,
as
the
titular
head
of
the
Democratic_party
,
apparently
must
make make%2:41:00::
the
move
to
reestablish reestablish%2:41:00::
relations
with
the
national
Democratic_party
or
see see%2:39:02::
a
movement
come come%2:42:04::
from
the
loyalist
ranks
to
completely
bypass bypass%2:32:00::
him
as
a
party
functionary
.
With
a
Democratic
administration
,
party
patronage
would
normally
begin begin%2:30:00::
to
flow flow%2:38:01::
to
Mississippi
if
it
had
held hold%2:42:00::
its
Democratic
solidarity
in
the
November
election
.
Now
,
the
picture
is be%2:42:03::
clouded
,
and
even
US
Sens._James_O._Eastland
and
John_C._Stennis
,
who
remained remain%2:30:00::
loyal
to
the
ticket
,
are be%2:42:03::
uncertain
of
their
status
.
Reports
are be%2:42:06::
that
it
is be%2:42:03::
more_than
probability
that
the
four
congressmen
from
Mississippi
who
did
not
support support%2:41:01::
the
party
ticket
will
be
stripped strip%2:40:03::
of
the
usual
patronage
which
flows flow%2:38:01::
to
congressmen
.
The
Gov._Jimmie_H._Davis
administration
appears appear%2:39:00::
to
face face%2:33:00::
a
difficult
year
in
1961
,
with
the
governor
's
theme
of
peace
and
harmony
subjected subject%2:39:03::
to
severe
stresses
.
The
year
will
probably
start_out start_out%2:30:00::
with
segregation
still
the_most
troublesome
issue
.
But
it
might
give_way give_way%2:38:00::
shortly
to
another
vexing
issue
-
that
of
finances
in
state_government
.
The
transition
from
segregation
to
finances
might
already
be be%2:42:03::
in_progress
,
in
the
form
of
an
administration
proposal
to
hike hike%2:38:01::
the
state
sales_tax
from
2
per_cent
to
3
per_cent
.
The
administration
has
said say%2:32:00::
the
sales_tax
proposal
is be%2:42:02::
merely
part
of
the
segregation
strategy
,
since
the
revenues
from
the
increase
would
be
dedicated dedicate%2:32:00::
to
a
grant
in
aid
program
.
But
the
tardiness
of
the
administration
in
making make%2:41:00::
the
dedication
has
caused cause%2:32:00::
legislators
to
suspect suspect%2:31:02::
the
tax_bill
was
related relate%2:31:00::
more
directly
to
an
over-all
shortage
of
cash
than
to
segregation
.
Indeed
,
the
administration
's
curious
position
on
the
sales_tax
was be%2:42:03::
a
major
factor
in
contributing contribute%2:41:12::
to
its
defeat
.
The
administration
could
not
say say%2:32:00::
why
$
28
million
was
needed need%2:42:00::
for
a
grant-in-aid
program
.
The
effectiveness
of
the
governor
in
clearing_up clear_up%2:32:00::
some
of
the
inconsistencies
revolving_about revolve_about%2:42:00::
the
sales_tax
bill
may
play play%2:41:12::
a
part
in
determining determine%2:31:02::
whether
it
can
muster muster%2:32:00::
the
required
two-thirds
vote
.
The
tax_bill
will
be be%2:42:03::
up
for
reconsideration
Wednesday
in
the
House
when
the
Legislature
reconvenes reconvene%2:38:00::
.
Davis
may
use use%2:34:01::
the
tax_bill
as
a
means
to
effect effect%2:36:00::
a
transition
from
special
sessions
of
the
Legislature
to
normalcy
.
If
it
fails fail%2:30:00::
to
pass pass%2:41:02::
,
he
can
throw throw%2:38:00::
up
his
hands
and
say say%2:32:00::
the
Legislature
would
not
support support%2:41:00::
him
in
his
efforts
to
prevent prevent%2:41:01::
integration
.
He
could
terminate terminate%2:30:01::
special
sessions
of
the
Legislature
.
Actually
,
Davis
would
have
to
toss_in_the_towel
soon
anyway
.
Many
legislators
are be%2:42:03::
already
weary
and
frustrated
over
the
so-far
losing
battle
to
block block%2:41:01::
token
integration
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
not
the
sort_of
thing
most
politicos
would
care care%2:37:00::
to
acknowledge acknowledge%2:32:00::
publicly
.
They
would
like like%2:37:01::
to
convey convey%2:32:00::
the
notion
something
is
being
done do%2:41:01::
,
even_though
it
is be%2:42:06::
something
they
know know%2:31:02::
to
be be%2:42:03::
ineffectual
.
Passage
of
the
sales_tax
measure
would
also
give give%2:40:05::
Davis
the
means
to
effect effect%2:36:00::
a
transition
.
He
could
tell tell%2:32:04::
the
Legislature
they
had
provided provide%2:40:00::
the
needed
funds
to
carry_on carry_on%2:32:00::
the
battle
.
Then
he
could
tell tell%2:32:02::
them
to
go_home go_home%2:38:00::
,
while
the
administration
continued continue%2:32:00::
to
wage wage%2:41:00::
the
battle
with
the
$
28
million
in
extra
revenues
the
sales_tax
measure
would
bring_in bring_in%2:40:01::
over
an
eight
months
period
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
difficult
to
be be%2:42:03::
certain
how
the
administration
views view%2:31:00::
that
$
28
million
,
since
the
views
of
one
leader
may may%2:42:01::
not
be be%2:42:03::
the
same
as
the
views
of
another
one
.
But
if
the
administration
should
find find%2:31:09::
it
does
not
need need%2:34:00::
the
$
28
million
for
a
grant-in-aid
program
,
a
not
unlikely
conclusion
,
it
could
very_well
seek seek%2:35:00::
a
way
to
use use%2:34:01::
the
money
for
other
purposes
.
This
would
be be%2:42:03::
in
perfect
consonance
with
the
underlying
concern
in
the
administration
-
the
shortage
of
cash
.
It
could
become become%2:42:01::
an
acute
problem
in
the
coming
fiscal_year
.
If
the
administration
does
not
succeed succeed%2:41:00::
in
passing pass%2:41:02::
the
sales_tax
bill
,
or
any
other
tax_bill
,
it
could
very_well
be
faced face%2:33:00::
this
spring
at
the
fiscal
session
of
the
Legislature
with
an
interesting
dilemma
.
Since
the
constitution
forbids forbid%2:32:00::
introduction
of
a
tax_bill
at
a
fiscal
session
,
the
administration
will
either
have
to
cut_down cut_down%2:30:00::
expenses
or
inflate inflate%2:30:01::
its
estimates
of
anticipated
revenues
.
In
either
case
,
it
could
call call%2:41:04::
a
special
session
of
the
Legislature
later
in
1961
to
make make%2:41:00::
another
stab
at
raising raise%2:40:00::
additional
revenues
through
a
tax
raiser
.
The
prospect
of
cutting_back cut_back%2:30:01::
spending
is be%2:42:03::
an
unpleasant
one
for
any
governor
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
one
that
most
try try%2:41:00::
to
avoid avoid%2:41:01::
