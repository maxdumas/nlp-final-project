Mr._Podger
always
particularly
enjoyed enjoy%2:37:01::
the
last
night
of
each
summer
at
Loon_Lake
.
The
narrow
fringe
of
sadness
that
ran run%2:42:00::
around
it
only
emphasized emphasize%2:30:00::
the
pleasure
.
The
evening
was
not
always
spent spend%2:42:00::
in
the
same
way
.
This
year
,
on
a
night
cool
with
the
front
of
September
moving_in move_in%2:38:02::
,
but
with
plenty
of
summer
still
about
,
the
Podgers
were
holding hold%2:36:00::
a
neighborhood
gathering
in
the
Pod
.
The
little
cottage
was
bursting burst%2:42:00::
with
people
of
all
ages
.
In_the_midst
of_it
all
,
Mr._Podger
came_out come_out%2:30:00::
on
the
Pod
porch
,
alone
.
He
had
that
day
attended attend%2:42:00::
a
country
auction
,
and
he
had
come_back come_back%2:38:00::
with
a
prize
.
The
prize
was be%2:42:06::
an
old-fashioned
,
woven
cloth
hammock
,
complete
with
cross-top
pillow
,
fringed
side
pieces
,
and
hooks
for
hanging
.
Mrs._Podger
had
obligingly
pushed push%2:38:00::
things
around
on
the
porch
to
make make%2:36:00::
room
for
it
,
and
there
it
was be%2:42:03::
,
slung sling%2:35:00::
in
a
vine-shaded
corner
,
the
night
breeze
rippling ripple%2:38:00::
its
fringe
with
a
slow
,
caressing
movement
.
Mr._Podger
sat_down sit_down%2:38:00::
in
it
,
pushed push%2:38:00::
himself
back_and_forth
in
one
or
two
slow
,
rhythmic
motions
,
and_then
swung swing%2:38:02::
his
feet
up
into
it
.
He
closed close%2:35:00::
his
eyes
and
let let%2:41:00::
the
unintelligible
drift
of
voices
sweep sweep%2:38:00::
pleasantly
over
him
.
Suddenly
one
young
voice
rose rise%2:38:06::
above
the
others
.
``
But
''
,
it
said say%2:32:00::
,
``
do
you
always
know know%2:31:02::
when
you
're be%2:42:03::
happy
''
?
The
voice
sank sink%2:30:00::
back
into
the
general
tangle
of
sound
,
but
the
question
stayed stay%2:42:02::
in
Mr._Podger
's
mind
.
Here
,
in
the
cool
,
autumn-touched
evening
,
Mr._Podger
mentally
retraced retrace%2:38:00::
a
day
that
had
left leave%2:42:02::
him
greatly
contented
and
at_peace
.
It
had
begun begin%2:42:00::
with
the_blue
jay
feather
.
Walking walk%2:38:00::
along
the
lake
before
breakfast
,
Mr._Podger
had
seen see%2:39:00::
the
feather
,
and
the_bird
that
had
lost lose%2:40:02::
it
in
flight
.
The
winging
spread
of
blue
had
gone_on go_on%2:42:00::
,
calling call%2:32:09::
harshly
,
into
the
wood
.
The
small
shaft
of
blue
had
drifted drift%2:38:00::
down
and
come come%2:30:03::
to
rest rest%2:35:00::
at
his
feet
.
All_day_long
Mr._Podger
,
who
was be%2:42:06::
a
straw-hat
man
in
the
summer
,
had
worn wear%2:29:00::
the
feather
in
the
band
of
his
broad-brimmed
sunshield
.
Would
a
blue
feather
in
a
man
's
hat
make make%2:30:00::
him
happy
all
day
?
Hardly
.
But
it
was be%2:42:03::
something
to
have
seen see%2:39:00::
it
floating float%2:38:00::
down
through
the
early
morning
sunshine
,
linking link%2:42:01::
the_blue
of
the
sky
with
the_blue
of
the
asters
by
the
lake
.
Then
,
since
the
auction
was
being
held hold%2:36:00::
nearby
,
he
had
walked walk%2:38:00::
to_it
.
And
there
,
on_the_way
,
had
been be%2:42:03::
the
box_turtle
,
that
slow
,
self-contained
,
world-ignoring
relic
of
pre-history
,
bent
,
for
reasons
best
known know%2:31:01::
to
itself
,
on
crossing cross%2:38:00::
the
road
.
It
was
doing do%2:42:00::
very_well
,
too
,
having
reached reach%2:38:06::
the
center
,
and
was
pursuing pursue%2:41:01::
its
way
with
commendable
singleness
of
purpose
when
Mr._Podger
saw see%2:36:00::
hazard
approaching approach%2:38:00::
in
the
shape
of
a
flashy
little
sports_car
.
Would
the
driver
see see%2:39:00::
the
turtle
?
Would
he
take_pains take_pains%2:41:00::
to
avoid avoid%2:32:00::
it
?
Mr._Podger
took_no_chances take_a_chance%2:41:00::
.
Taking_off take_off%2:35:01::
his
hat
and
signaling signal%2:32:00::
the
driver
with_it
,
Mr._Podger
stepped step%2:38:00::
into
the
road
,
lifted lift%2:38:00::
the
surprised
turtle
and
consummated consummate%2:36:00::
its
road-crossing
with
what
must
have
been be%2:42:03::
a
breath-taking
suddenness
.
The
turtle
immediately
withdrew withdraw%2:30:00::
into
its
private
council
room
to
study study%2:31:04::
the
phenomenon
.
But
Mr._Podger
and
the
driver
of
the
sports_car
waved wave%2:32:00::
at
each
other
.
Here
in
the
cool
darkness
Mr._Podger
could
still
feel feel%2:39:00::
the
warmth
of
midday
,
could
still
see see%2:39:00::
the
yellow
butterflies
dancing dance%2:38:01::
over
the
road
,
could
still
see see%2:39:00::
the
friendly
grin
on
the
young
,
sun-browned
face
as
the
driver
looked_back look_back%2:39:00::
over
his
shoulder
for
a
moment
before
the
car
streaked streak%2:38:00::
out_of_sight
.
Where
was be%2:42:05::
the
driver
now
?
What
was
he
doing do%2:41:04::
?
And
the
turtle
?
Mr._Podger
smiled smile%2:29:00::
.
For
a_few
brief
minutes
they
had
all
been be%2:42:03::
part
of
one
little
drama
.
The
three
would
never
meet meet%2:38:01::
again
,
but
for_some_reason
or
other
Mr._Podger
was be%2:42:03::
sure
he
would
always
remember remember%2:31:02::
the
incident
.
Then
there
had
been be%2:42:04::
the
auction
itself
.
Mr._Podger
heard hear%2:39:00::
again
,
at_will
,
the
voice
of
the
auctioneer
,
the
voices
of
the
bidders
,
and
finally
the
small
boy
who
had
been be%2:42:03::
so
interested
in
Mr._Podger
's
hammock
purchase
.
``
I
like like%2:37:05::
them
things
,
too
''
,
he
had
said say%2:32:00::
.
``
We

Mr._Podger
had
thanked thank%2:32:00::
him
gravely
,
and
now
he
made make%2:41:00::
use
of
the
advice
.
As
he
pulled pull%2:35:00::
the
fringed
sides
up
and
made make%2:36:05::
himself
into
a
cocoon
,
Mr._Podger
saw see%2:36:00::
that
thin
,
attractive
,
freckled
little
face
again
,
and
hoped hope%2:37:00::
that
the
boy
,
too
,
was
lying lie%2:35:00::
in
a
cool
,
fringed-wrapped
quiet

Alacrity
,
the
Podger
cat
,
came come%2:38:00::
by
the
hammock
,
rubbed rub%2:35:00::
her
back
briefly
against
it
,
and_then
,
sure
of
a
welcome
,
hopped hop%2:38:04::
up
.
She
remarked remark%2:32:00::
that
she
found find%2:31:10::
the
night
wind
a_little

and
Mr._Podger
took take%2:38:09::
her
inside

Soon
her
purring
rivaled rival%2:42:00::
the
chirping
of
the
tree_crickets

rivaled rival%2:42:00::
the
hum

Mr._Podger
was
just
adding add%2:30:00::
this

his
pictures

the
screen_door
opened open%2:35:06::

Mr._Podger
opened open%2:35:00::
his

emerged emerge%2:30:00::

tucking tuck%2:35:00::

under

.
As
the
South
begins begin%2:36:00::
another
school_year
,
national
and
even
world
attention
is
directed direct%2:33:01::
at
the
region
's
slow
progress
toward
racial
equality
in
the
public_schools
.
Desegregation
is
beginning begin%2:42:00::
in
two
more
important
Southern
cities
-
Dallas
and
Atlanta
.
In
each
city
civic
and
education
leaders
have
been
working work%2:41:02::
hard
to
get get%2:30:02::
public_opinion
prepared
to
accept accept%2:31:01::
the
inevitability
of
equal
treatment
.
These
programs
emphasize emphasize%2:30:00::
the
acceptance
of
biracial
classrooms
peacefully
.
The
programs
do
not
take take%2:31:01::
sides
on
the
issue
itself
.
They
point_out point_out%2:32:03::
simply
that
``
it
is be%2:42:06::
the
law
of
the
land
''
.
The
two
cities
have have%2:40:00::
the
examples
of
Little_Rock
and
New_Orleans
to
hold_up hold_up%2:39:00::
as
warnings
against
resorting resort%2:41:11::
to
violence
to
try try%2:41:00::
to
stop stop%2:42:00::
the
processes
of
desegregation
.
Even
better
,
they
have have%2:40:00::
the
examples
of
Nashville
and
Houston
to
hold_up hold_up%2:39:00::
as
peaceful
and
progressive
programs
.
In
each
case
there
was be%2:42:04::
an
initial
act
of
violence
.
In
Nashville
,
a
school
was
dynamited dynamite%2:30:00::
.
In
Houston
,
there
were be%2:42:04::
a_few
incidents
of
friction
between
whites
and
Negroes
,
none
of_which
were be%2:42:03::
serious
.
In
each
city
quick
public
reaction
and
fast
action
by
the
city
government
halted halt%2:41:00::
the
threats
of
more
serious
incidents
.
The
Nashville
plan
,
incidentally
,
has
become become%2:30:00::
recognized
as
perhaps
the_most
acceptable
and
thus
the_most
practical
to
put put%2:35:05::
into
effect
in
the
troubled
South
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
a
``
stair-step
''
plan
,
in_which
desegregation
begins begin%2:42:00::
in
the
first_grade
.
Each_year
another
grade
is
added add%2:30:00::
to
the
process
,
until
finally
all
12
grades
are be%2:42:03::
integrated
.
The
schedules
are be%2:42:03::
flexible
so_that
the
program
can
be
accelerated accelerate%2:30:00::
as
the
public
becomes become%2:30:00::
more
tolerant
or
realizes realize%2:31:00::
that
it
is be%2:42:06::
something
that
has have%2:42:05::
to
be
done do%2:41:01::
,
``
so
why
not
now
''
.
The
program
has
worked work%2:41:03::
well
in
both
Nashville
and
Houston
.
It
met meet%2:38:01::
a
serious
rebuff
in
New_Orleans
,
where
the
two
schools
selected select%2:31:00::
for
the
first
moves
toward
integration
were
boycotted boycott%2:41:00::
by
white
parents
.
Another
attempt
will
be
made make%2:36:08::
this
year
in
New_Orleans
to
resume resume%2:30:01::
the
program
.
Generally
,
throughout
the
South
,
there
is be%2:42:04::
a
growing
impatience
with
the
pattern
of
violence
with
which
every
step
of
desegregation
is
met meet%2:33:00::
.
Perhaps
the_most
eloquent
move
toward
removal
of
racial
barriers
has
been be%2:42:04::
in
Dallas
.
During
the
summer
,
Negroes
began begin%2:30:00::
quietly
patronizing patronize%2:41:00::
previously
segregated
restaurants
and
lunch
counters
in
downtown
retail
establishments
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
part
of
a
citywide
move
toward
full
integration
.
So
successful
has
been be%2:42:03::
this
program
,
worked_out work_out%2:30:00::
by
white
and
Negro
civic_leaders
,
that
further
extensions
are
expected expect%2:31:00::
in
the
next
few
months
.
Hotels
,
for_example
,
are be%2:42:03::
ready
to
let_down let_down%2:38:00::
the
bars
.
Already
,
at_least
one
hotel
has
been
quietly
taking
reservations
on
a
nonracial
basis
.
Several
conventions
have
been
held hold%2:36:00::
in
recent
months
in
hotels
on
a
nonsegregated
basis
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
a
radical
change
in
attitude
from
the
conditions
which
prevailed prevail%2:42:02::
several
years
ago
,
when
a
series
of
bombings
was
directed direct%2:33:01::
against
Negroes
who
were
moving_into move_into%2:38:00::
previously
all-white
neighborhoods
of
Dallas
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
also
symptomatic_of
a
change
in
attitude
which
appears appear%2:39:00::
to
be
spreading spread%2:35:07::
all
across
the
South
.
Southern
whites
themselves
are
realizing realize%2:31:00::
that
they
had
been be%2:42:03::
wrong
in
using use%2:34:02::
violence
to
try try%2:41:00::
to
stop stop%2:41:00::
Negroes
from
claiming claim%2:40:00::
equal
rights
.
They
insist insist%2:32:00::
they
are be%2:42:03::
ashamed
of
such
violence
and
intimidation
as
occurred occur%2:30:00::
in
Alabama
when
the
Freedom
Riders
sought seek%2:41:00::
to
break_down break_down%2:33:00::
racial
discrimination
in
local
bus_depots
.
All
across
the
South
there
are be%2:42:04::
signs
that
racial
violence
is
finding find%2:40:02::
less
approval
among
whites
who
themselves
would
never
take take_part%2:41:00::
active
part
but
might
once
have
shown show%2:39:04::
a
tolerant
attitude
toward
it
.
There
are be%2:42:03::
many
causes
for
this
change
.
One
of
the_most
important
is be%2:42:03::
economic
.
Business_leaders
are be%2:42:03::
aware
now
that
they
suffer suffer%2:30:00::
greatly
from
any
outbreak
of
violence
.
They
are
putting put%2:35:05::
strong
pressure
on
their
police_departments
to
keep keep%2:42:00::
order
.
In_the_past
these
same
Southerners
were
inclined incline%2:42:01::
to
look_the_other_way
.
And
as
the
businessmen
have
begun begin%2:30:00::
to
act act%2:41:00::
,
a
real
sense
of
co-operation
has
sprung_up spring_up%2:42:00::
.
This
co-operation
has
emboldened embolden%2:37:00::
other
Southern
whites
to
add add%2:30:00::
their
voices
to
demands
for
peaceable
accommodation
.
They
realize realize%2:31:01::
that
by
acting act%2:41:00::
in_concert
,
rather_than
individually
,
they
will
not
be
picked_out pick_out%2:31:00::
as
objects
of
retaliation
-
economic
and
otherwise
.
Since
moving move%2:38:02::
from
a
Chicago
suburb
to
Southern_California
a_few
months
ago
,
I
've
been
introduced introduce%2:32:00::
to
a
new
game
called
Lanesmanship
.
Played play%2:33:00::
mostly
on
the
freeways
around
Los_Angeles
,
it
goes go%2:42:02::
like
this
:
A
driver
cruising cruise%2:38:02::
easily
at
70
m.
p.
h.
in
Lane
A
of
a
four-lane
freeway
spies spy%2:39:00::
an
incipient
traffic_jam
ahead
.
Traffic
in
the
next
lane
appears appear%2:39:00::
to
be
moving move%2:38:03::
more
smoothly
so
he
pokes poke%2:39:00::
a
tentative
fender
into
Lane_B
,
which
is be%2:42:03::
heavily
populated
by
cars
also
moving move%2:38:03::
at
70
m.
p.
h.
.
The
adjacent
driver
in
Lane_B
has have%2:40:00::
three
choices
open_to
him
.
He
can
(
1
)
point point%2:38:05::
his
car
resolutely
at
the
invading
fender
and
force force%2:41:00::
the
other
driver
back
into
Lane
A
;
(

)
slow_down slow_down%2:30:00::
and
permit permit%2:41:00::
the
ambivalent
driver
to
change change%2:30:05::
lanes
;
or
(
3
)
alternately
accelerate accelerate%2:30:00::
and
decelerate decelerate%2:30:00::
,
thus
keeping keep%2:42:00::
the
first
driver
guessing guess%2:32:00::
as
to
his
intentions
,
thereby
making make%2:36:00::
a
fascinating
sport
of
the
whole
affair
.
The
really
remarkable
thing
to
me
is be%2:42:03::
that
most
California
natives
unhesitatingly
elect elect%2:31:00::
to
slow_down slow_down%2:30:00::
and
permit permit%2:32:00::
the
invading
car
free
access
.
Whether
or
not
this
is
done do%2:41:01::
out
of
enlightened
self-preservation
,
I
do
n't
know know%2:31:02::
.
But
it
is
done do%2:41:01::
,
consistently
and
I
'm be%2:42:03::
both
surprised
and
impressed
.
This
could
never
happen happen%2:30:01::
in
my
native
Chicago
.
There
such
soggy
acquiesence
would
be
looked_upon look_upon%2:31:00::
as
a
sure
sign
of
deteriorating
manhood
.
In
Chicago
,
the
driver
cut_out cut_out%2:35:03::
would
likely
jam jam%2:38:01::
his
gas
pedal
to
the
floor
in
an
effort
to
force force%2:41:00::
the
other
car
back
.
Failing fail%2:41:00::
this
,
he
would
pull pull%2:38:01::
alongside
at
the
first
opportunity
and
shake shake%2:38:00::
his
fist
threateningly
.
This
negative
explanation
of
courtesy
on
the
freeways
,
however
,
does do%2:41:01::
an
injustice
to
Southern_California
drivers
.
At
the
risk
of
losing lose%2:40:02::
my
charge-a-plate
at
Marshall_Field
and
Company
,
I
would
like like%2:37:01::
to
challenge challenge%2:32:01::
an
old
and
hallowed
stereotype
.
After
three
months
of
research
,
I
can
state state%2:32:00::
unequivocally
that
Los_Angeles
drivers
are be%2:42:03::
considerably
more
courteous
and
competent
than
any
other
drivers
I
've
ever
encountered encounter%2:38:00::
.
During
one
recent
day
of
driving
about
Los_Angeles
there
were be%2:42:04::
actually
a
dozen
occasions
when
oncoming
drivers
stopped stop%2:38:01::
an
entire
lane
of
traffic
to
permit permit%2:41:00::
me
to
pull_out pull_out%2:38:00::
of
an
impossible
side
street
.
