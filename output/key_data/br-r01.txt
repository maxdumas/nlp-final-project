It
was
among
these
that
Hinkle
identified identify%2:31:00::
a

For
it
seems seem%2:39:01::
that
Barco
,
fancying fancy%2:36:00::
himself
a
ladies
'
man
(
and
why
not
,
after
seven
marriages
?
)
,
had
listed list%2:41:00::
himself
for
Mormon_Beard
roles
at
the
instigation
of
his
fourth
murder
victim
who
had
said say%2:32:00::
:
``
With
your

dear
,
you
ought ought%2:42:01::
to

!
Mills
secured secure%2:40:00::
Barco
's
photograph
from
the
gentleman
in
charge
,
rushed rush%2:38:00::
to
the
Hollywood
police_station
to
report report%2:32:00::
the
theft
,
and
less_than
five
minutes
later
,
detectives
with
his
picture
in_hand
were be%2:42:05::
on
the
trail
of
Cal_Barco
.
On
their
way
,
they
stopped stop%2:38:00::
at
every
gas_station
along
the
main
boulevards
to
question question%2:32:03::
the
attendants
.
Finally
,
at
Ye_Olde_Gasse
Filling_Station
on
Avocado_Avenue
,
they
learned learn%2:31:01::
that
their
man
,
having
paused pause%2:42:00::
to
get get%2:30:03::
oil
for
his
car
,
had
asked ask%2:32:00::
about
the
route
to
San_Diego
.
They
headed head%2:38:00::
in_that
direction
and
,
at
San_Juan
Capistrano_by-the-Sea
came_upon come_upon%2:40:09::
Barco
sitting sit%2:35:00::
in
the
quaint
old
Spanish
Mission_Drive-in
,
eating eat%2:34:00::
a
hot
tamale
.
At
the
moment
,
Barco
's
back
was be%2:42:03::
to
the
road
so
he
did
n't
see see%2:39:00::
the
detectives
close_in close_in%2:38:00::
on
his
convertible
which
,
in
their
quest
for
the
stolen
lap
rug
,
they
proceeded proceed%2:32:00::
to
search search%2:39:00::
.
The
robe
,
however
,
was be%2:42:03::
missing
,
for
by
that
time
Barco
had
disposed dispose%2:40:11::
of
it
at
a
pawnshop
in
Glendale
.
The
detectives
placed place%2:41:01::
Barco
under
arrest
and
,
without
informing inform%2:32:00::
him
of
the
nature
of
the
charge
,
took take_back%2:38:03::
him
back
to
Hollywood
for
questioning
.
Thus
it
was
that
Barco
,
apprehended apprehend%2:35:00::
for
mere
larceny
,
now
began begin%2:30:00::
to
suspect suspect%2:31:02::
that
one
or
another
of
his
murders
had
been
uncovered uncover%2:39:00::
.
During
the
return
trip
,
Barco
kept keep%2:42:07::
muttering mutter%2:32:01::
to
himself
in
meaningless
phrases
,
such_as
:
``
They
're be%2:42:05::
under
sand_dunes
.
They
're be%2:42:03::
better
off
,
I
tell tell%2:32:04::
you
.
I
saved save%2:41:01::
their
souls
''
.
The
detective
,
commenting comment%2:32:00::
on
Barco
's
behavior
,
felt feel%2:31:00::
that
he
merely
belonged belong%2:42:00::
among
the
myriad
citizens
of
our
community
who
are be%2:42:03::
mentally
unhinged
-
that
he
was be%2:42:03::
a
more_or_less
harmless
``
nut
''
!
However
while
in
his
cell
awaiting await%2:31:00::
trial
for
theft
,
Barco
,
in
a
fit
of
apprehension
,
made make%2:41:00::
an
attempt
to
take take%2:32:00::
his
own
life
.
The
attempt
had
failed fail%2:41:00::
because
,
when
endeavoring endeavor%2:41:00::
to
cut cut%2:35:00::
his
wrists
,
this
murderer
of
seven
women
had
fainted faint%2:29:00::
at
the
sight
of
blood
.
The
jail
authorities
-
attaching attach%2:35:01::
no
particular
significance
to
the
episode
-
offered offer%2:40:02::
Barco
whisky
to
revive revive%2:29:01::
him
;
but
the
old
fellow
,
a
lifelong
teetotaler
,
refused refuse%2:40:00::
it
,
and
no_more
was
thought_of think_of%2:31:00::
the_matter
.
Then
it
was
that
District_Attorney
Welch
entered enter%2:38:00::
the
case
.
A
man
of
vaulting
ambition
,
with
one
eye
on
the
mayorship
of
Los_Angeles
,
nothing
ever
escaped escape%2:42:00::
him
which
might
possibly
lead lead%2:42:12::
to
personal
publicity
.
It
was
reported report%2:32:00::
to
Welch
's
office
that
a
thief
in
the
city
jail
had
attempted attempt%2:36:00::
suicide
.
Welch
wanted want%2:37:00::
to
know know%2:31:01::
why
.
No
one
knew know%2:31:01::
.
Now
Welch
had have%2:40:00::
a
pet
theory
that
everyone
is be%2:42:03::
guilty
of
breaking break%2:41:00::
more
laws
than
he
ever
gets
caught catch%2:31:01::
at
.
The
suicide
attempt
looked look%2:39:01::
to
him
like
an
opportunity
to
put put%2:35:05::
his
theory
to
the
test
.
So
he
paid pay%2:41:00::
a
call
on
Barco
in
his
cell
and
began begin%2:30:00::
their
chat
by
stating state%2:32:00::
bluntly
:
``
Barco
,
we
've
got get%2:40:00::
the
goods
on
you
!
It
'll
be be%2:42:03::
a_lot
better
if
you
come_clean
''
.
At_first
Barco
was be%2:42:03::
evasive
and
shifty
.
But
with
Welch
's
relentless
pursuit
of
the
subject
,
Barco
finally
``
broke break%2:37:00::
''
and
started start%2:30:00::
confessing confess%2:32:00::
to
one
murder
after
another
.
By
the
time
Barco
reached reach%2:40:00::
the
count
of
three
,
the
situation
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
Welch
almost
too
good
to
be be%2:42:03::
true
.
But
if
true
,
it
was be%2:42:03::
the
case
of_which
he
had
dreamed dream%2:36:00::
,
the
case
which
would
throw
him
into
headlines
all_over
America
as
the
hero
of
a
great
murder
trial
.
Welch
summoned summon%2:32:00::
jail
officials
to
Barco
's
cell
.
But
to
Welch
's
chagrin
,
the
police_captain
pooh-poohed pooh-pooh%2:32:01::
Welch
's
credulity
in
Barco
's
confession
.
Barco
was be%2:42:03::
clearly
a
``
nut
''
.
It
required require%2:42:00::
strength
,
bravado
,
daring
to
commit commit%2:41:00::
murder
.
``
That
worm
a
murderer
?
Ridiculous
''
!
Then
,
for_the_first_time
since
his
arrest
,
a
glint
of
spirit
lit light%2:30:00::
Barco
's
eyes
.
His
manhood
had
been
attacked attack%2:32:00::
.
He
stiffened stiffen%2:30:00::
and
rose rise%2:38:05::
to
his
feet
.
He
'd
show show%2:31:00::
them
!
``
Is
that
so
''
?
he
queried query%2:32:00::
.
``
Well
,
for
ten
years
I
've
been
murdering murder%2:41:00::

I

and
there
ai

nor

nor

there
's

''
The
next
day
the
police_captain
,
in
derision
,
organized organize%2:41:01::
what
he
termed term%2:32:00::
``
Welch
's
Wild_Goose_Chase
''
.
For
indeed
it
seemed seem%2:39:00::
incredible
that
anyone
could
go_on go_on%2:42:00::
committing commit%2:41:00::
murder
for
ten
years
and
not
get get%2:30:00::
caught catch%2:31:01::
at
it
,
even
in
Hollywood
.
The
searching
party
consisted_of consist_of%2:42:00::
the
police_captain
,
Welch
,
Barco
,
policemen
with
shovels
,
newspaper
reporters
,
and
cameramen
.
Barco
,
his
state
of
apprehension
gone go%2:30:08::
,
never
to
return return%2:38:00::
,
had
assumed assume%2:41:00::
a
matter-of-factness
which
remained remain%2:30:00::
his
principal
attitude
from_that_time_on
.
He
directed direct%2:36:00::
the
cortege
of
autos
to
the
sand_dunes
near
Santa_Monica
.
Stopping stop%2:38:00::
the
cars
at
a
fork
in
the
road
,
he
got_out get_out%2:38:01::
,
paced pace%2:30:00::
off
a
certain
distance
to
a
spot
between
two
shrub-covered
sand
hills
,
and
indicated indicate%2:32:03::
a
location
.
Orders
were
given give%2:40:07::
to
dig dig%2:35:00::
.
Nothing
was
found find%2:40:02::
.
Welch
was be%2:42:03::
worried
.
The
police_captain
chortled chortle%2:29:00::
.
The
newspaper
boys
cracked
jokes
and
again
Barco
's
pride
was
aroused arouse%2:37:00::
.
With
greater
precision
he
again
paced pace%2:30:00::
off
a
location
,
this
time
a_little
more
to
the
left
.
With
quibs
and
gibes
,
the
policemen
again
started start%2:30:00::
digging dig%2:35:00::
.
Welch
was be%2:42:03::
on
edge
.
The
captain
was
remarking remark%2:32:00::
that
it
was be%2:42:03::
a
nice
day
for
a
picnic
when
finally
one
of
the
shovels
struck strike%2:35:01::
an
object
.
``
There
's be%2:42:05::
something
here
''
!
said say%2:32:00::
the
digger
.
Joking
stopped stop%2:38:00::
and
everyone
gathered gather%2:38:00::
around
.
The
digger
,
thrusting thrust%2:38:01::
about
with
his
shovel
,
now
raised raise%2:38:00::
into
view
a
package
crudely
wrapped
in
one
of
the
murderer
's
Hollywood
sport_shirts
.
Although
it
was be%2:42:06::
a
mere
fragment
of
the
victim
's
remains
,
it
was be%2:42:03::
enough
.
Welch
was be%2:42:03::
wild
with
delight
.
His
elation
grew grow%2:30:00::
as
Barco
's
seven
disclosures
brought bring%2:35:04::
to
light
one
reward
after
another
.
Now
did
Welch
truly
become become%2:42:01::
the
man
of
the
hour
,
and
everything
that
followed follow%2:42:00::
in
the
procedure
of
Justice
was be%2:42:03::
a
new
triumph
for
him
.
It
went_to go_to%2:38:00::
his
head
,
and
his
ambition
increased increase%2:30:00::
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
apparent
that
Welch
was be%2:42:03::
in
cahoots
with
Marshall
and
would
use use%2:34:01::
his
power
as
D._A.
to
drag drag%2:35:01::
every
possible
sensation
into
the
case
.
Every
new
scandal
which
would
provide provide%2:40:00::
more
``
copy
''
for
Marshall
's
pen
would
thus
mean mean%2:42:00::
more
publicity
for
Welch
.
I
knew know%2:31:02::
that
both
these
cynics
were
waiting wait%2:31:00::
with_impatience
for
the
dramatic
moment
when
Viola
was
called call%2:32:05::
to
the
stand
.
Once
there
,
the
D._A.
with
devilish
cleverness
would
provide provide%2:40:00::
Marshall
with
headlines
:
``
Viola
's
Multiple_Romances
''
,
``
Viola_Lake
an
Addict
''
,
``
Downfall
of
Another
Film_Idol
''
!
It
would
be be%2:42:03::
fine
publicity
for
the
man
who
was be%2:42:03::
willing
to
walk walk%2:38:00::
to
the
mayor
's
throne
over
the
broken
reputation
of
a
helpless
girl
!
I
studied study%2:31:02::
Welch
closely
as
the
trial
progressed progress%2:30:00::
for
any
hint
which
might
give give%2:40:05::
me
a
lead
as
to
how
he
might
be
thwarted thwart%2:41:00::
.
It
was
n't
long
before
I
sensed sense%2:39:00::
that
there
was
something
deeper
than
overvaulting
ambition
back
of
his
desire
for
Viola
's
destruction
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
bitter
and
resentful
toward
her
,
personally
resentful
.
A
dreadful
fear
entered enter%2:38:00::
my
consciousness
that
perhaps
he
had
entertained entertain%2:31:00::
aspirations
toward
Viola
's
favors
-
or
,
even
more
serious
perhaps
,
that
he
had
attained attain%2:41:00::
a
share
of
them
and
had
then
been
superseded supersede%2:41:00::
by
some
luckier
chap
.
I
did
not
rest rest%2:32:00::
until
I
had
tracked track%2:38:00::
the
mystery
down
.
Well
,
here
it
is
.
One_day
over
a
year
before
,
there
had
been be%2:42:04::
a
cocktail_party
in
an
apartment
of
a
downtown
hotel
.
Viola
had
been
urged urge%2:32:00::
to
attend attend%2:42:00::
,
by
telephone
,
and
not
knowing know%2:31:00::
the
host
or
the
character
of
the
party
,
she
had
gone go%2:38:00::
.
She
arrived arrive%2:38:00::
late
and
as
she
entered enter%2:38:00::
the
party
,
noted note%2:32:00::
that
gentlemen
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
in
the
majority
;
the
air
was be%2:42:03::
thick_with
smoke
,
empty
bottles
were be%2:42:03::
in_evidence
,
and
several
of
the
guests
were be%2:42:03::
somewhat
the
worse
for
liquor
.
Naturally
,
Viola
had have%2:40:00::
no
wish
to
remain remain%2:42:03::
,
but
she
felt feel%2:31:00::
she
could
n't
leave leave%2:38:01::
so
soon
after
her
arrival
,
in_all
politeness
to
her
host
.
And
it
so
happened happen%2:30:00::
that
adjacent
to
a
couch
on_which
she
had
taken take%2:38:00::
refuge
was be%2:42:05::
a
small
table
on_which
she
noted note%2:32:00::
a
vase
of
red
rosebuds
;
while
projecting project%2:42:00::
from
beneath
the
couch
were be%2:42:05::
a
pair
of
feet
which
,
as
Fate
would
have have%2:40:00::
it
,
belonged_to belong_to%2:42:00::
District_Attorney
Welch
.
As
Viola
sat sit%2:35:00::
there
,
a
playful
impulse
overcame overcome%2:33:03::
her
to
remove remove%2:30:00::
the
shoes
and
socks
from
the
unidentified
feet
and
,
as
a
prank
,
insert insert%2:30:00::
rosebuds
between
the
toes
.
A_little
later
the
district_attorney
woke_up wake_up%2:29:01::
,
emerged emerge%2:30:00::
from
under
the
couch
,
looked look%2:39:00::
at
his
watch
,
and
realized realize%2:31:01::
he
had have%2:40:00::
an
engagement
that
very
hour
to
address address%2:32:02::
a
meeting
of
the
Culture_Forum
on
``
The
Civic_Spirit
of
the
Southland
''
,
in
the
Byzantine
room
of
the
hotel
where
his
wife
,
as
president
of
the
forum
,
was
to
preside preside%2:41:00::
.
He
made_his_way make_one's_way%2:38:00::
to
his
host
's
bedroom
where
he
carefully
brushed brush%2:35:01::
himself
off
,
neatly
arranged arrange%2:29:00::
his
hair
,
and
painstakingly
selected select%2:31:00::
his
hat
from
the
many
on
the
bed
.
Then
,
noting note%2:32:00::
neither
the
absence
of
his
footwear
nor
the
presence
of
the
rosebuds
,
he
made_his_way make_one's_way%2:38:00::
to
the
Byzantine
room
and
,
with
his
usual
dignity
,
mounted mount%2:38:01::
the
rostrum
.
The
effect
on
the
intellectuals
among
his
audience
may
well
be
imagined imagine%2:36:00::
.
The
incident
,
aside
from
reflecting reflect%2:43:00::
on
Welch
's
political
career
,
had
all_but
wrecked wreck%2:35:00::
his
home
life
.
He
never
rested rest%2:32:00::
until
he
discovered discover%2:32:04::
who
the
culprit
was be%2:42:06::
,
and
when
he
did
,
he
vowed vow%2:32:00::
vengeance
on
Viola_Lake
if
ever
the
chance
came come%2:38:00::
his
way
.
And
here
it
was be%2:42:05::
!
By
such
innocent
actions
are
human
tragedies
sometimes
set_in_motion set_in_motion%2:35:05::
.
During
these
first
days
of
the
trial
I
did
n't
have have%2:40:00::
as
much
time
to
commiserate commiserate%2:37:00::
with
Viola
as
I
should
have
liked like%2:37:01::
.
In_the_first_place
,
it
was be%2:42:03::
difficult
for
us
to
meet meet%2:41:01::
.
We
could

for
the
tongue

Scandal
was be%2:42:03::
ever
ready_to
link link%2:31:00::
our
names
,
and
the
tongue
of
Scandal
finds find%2:39:02::
but
one
thing
to
say say%2:32:00::
of
the
association
of
a
man
with
a
girl
,
no_matter_how
innocent
.
I
could
n't
invite invite%2:41:00::
Viola
to
our
house
,
for
Mother
snobbishly
refused refuse%2:32:00::
to
receive receive%2:35:00::
her
.
Now
the
Czarship
had
not
affected affect%2:30:00::
my
own
sense
of
social
values
,
but
Mother
had
attained attain%2:41:00::
a
reflected
glory
through
it
,
which
had
opened open%2:35:00::
the
doors
of
Los_Angeles-Pasadena_Society
to
her
.
There
,
Mother
was
received receive%2:35:00::
by
the
scions
of
aristocratic
lines
which
are
dominated dominate%2:42:01::
by
the
Budweisers
(
of
beer
derivation
)
,
the
Chalmers
(
of
underwear
origin
)
,
and
the
Heinzes
(
whose
forbears
founded found%2:41:00::
a
nationally
famous
trade
in
pickles
)
.
I
hated hate%2:37:00::
being
dragged drag%2:35:01::
into
the
salons
of
these
aristocrats
.
But
Mother
insisted insist%2:32:03::
,
for
it
is
seldom
indeed
that
anyone
remotely
connected
with
the
cinema
is
ever
received receive%2:35:00::
in
their
exclusive
midsts
.
In_fact
,
it
was
not
until
the
King
of
Spain
had
visited visit%2:38:00::
at
Pickfair
that
Mary
and
Doug
were
beckoned beckon%2:32:00::
to
cross cross%2:38:00::
the
sacred
barriers
which
separate separate%2:42:00::
Los_Angeles
and
Pasadena
from
the
hoi-polloi
.
Mother
even
went go%2:41:00::
so_far
as
to
trump_up trump_up%2:36:00::
for
me
matrimonial
opportunities
with
Pasadena
debs
who
had
been
educated educate%2:41:01::
abroad
,
and
with
those
of
the
more
lenient
Los_Angeles
area
where
a
debutante
was be%2:42:06::
a
girl
who
had
been be%2:42:03::
to
high_school
.
But
at_long_last
came come%2:38:04::
a
time
when
I
broke_away break_away%2:38:01::
from
Mother
and
her
society
``
chi-chi
''
in_order_to
spend spend%2:42:00::
a
cosy
evening
with
Viola
and
her
chaperon
at
her
home
.
However
,
such
a
hotbed
of
gossip
had
grown grow%2:30:00::
up
during
the
trial
,
that
every
precaution
had have%2:42:05::
to
be
taken take%2:41:04::
to

my
visit
from
being

to

When
