Prop.
Coaching
had
declined decline%2:30:01::
considerably
by
1905
,
but
the
sign
was be%2:42:05::
still
there
,
near
the
old
Wells_Fargo
building
in
San_Francisco
,
creaking creak%2:39:00::
in
the
fog
as
it
had
for
thirty
years
.
John_Vernon
had
had have%2:40:00::
all
the
patronage
he
cared_for care_for%2:37:01::
-
he
had
prospered prosper%2:40:00::
,
but
he
could
not
retire retire%2:41:02::
from
horsedom
.
Coaching coach%2:38:00::
was be%2:42:05::
in
his
blood
.
He
had have%2:40:00::
two
interests
in
life
:
the
pleasures
of
the
table
and
driving
.
Twice
a
week
he
drove drive%2:38:01::
his
tallyho
over
the
Santa_Cruz
road
,
upland
and
through
the
redwood
forest
,
with
orchards
below
him
at
one
hand
,
and
glimpses
of
the
Pacific
at
the
other
.
The
journey
back
he
made
along
the
coast
road
,
traveling travel%2:38:00::
hell-for-leather
,
every
lantern
of
the
tallyho
ablaze
.
The
southward
route
was be%2:42:03::
the
classic
run
in
California
,
and
the_most
fashionable
.
His
patronage
on
this
stretch
was
made_up make_up%2:42:00::
largely
of
San_Franciscans
-
regulars
,
most_of
them
,
and
trenchermen
like
himself
.
They
did
not
complain complain%2:32:00::
at
the
inhuman
hour
of
starting start%2:30:00::
(
seven
in
the
morning
)
,
nor
of
the
tariff
,
which
was be%2:42:03::
reasonable
since
it
covered cover%2:42:02::
everything
but
the
tobacco
.
Breakfast
was be%2:42:04::
at
the
Palace_Hotel
,
luncheon
was be%2:42:04::
somewhere
in
the
mountain
forest
,
and
dinner
was be%2:42:04::
either
at
Boulder_Creek
or
at
Santa_Cruz
.
Gazing gaze%2:39:00::
too
long
at
the
scenery
could
be be%2:42:03::
tiring
,
so
halts
were
contrived contrive%2:36:01::
between
meals
.
Then
the
Chinese
hostler
,
who
rode ride%2:38:00::
with
Vernon
on
the
box
,
would
break_open break_open%2:35:01::
a
hamper
and
produce produce%2:39:01::
filets
of
smoked
bass
or
sturgeon
,
sandwiches
,
pickled
eggs
,
and
a
rum
sangaree
to
be
heated heat%2:30:01::
over
a
spirit_lamp
.
In
spring
and
in
autumn
the
run
was
made make%2:41:00::
for
a
group
of
botanists
which
included include%2:42:00::
an
old
friend
of
mine
.
They
gathered gather%2:35:00::
roots
,
bulbs
,
odd
ferns
,
leaves
,
and
bits
of
resin
from
the
rare
Santa_Lucia_fir
,
which
exists exist%2:42:00::
only
on
a
forty-five
mile
strip
on
the
westerly
side
of
these
mountains
.
In
the
Spanish
days
Franciscan
monks
roamed roam%2:38:00::
here
to
collect collect%2:35:00::
the
resin
for
incense
.
It
yields yield%2:36:00::
a
fragrance
as
Orphic
as
that
of
the
pastilles
of
Malabar
.
Vernon
was be%2:42:03::
serviceable
on
the
botanical
field
trips
,
but
he
could
arrange arrange%2:32:04::
no
schedule

the
cooks
,
and
he
was be%2:42:03::
glad
when
the
trips
dropped_off drop_off%2:30:01::
,
and
the
botanists
began begin%2:30:00::
to
motor motor%2:38:00::
out
by
themselves

My
friend
often
breakfasted breakfast%2:34:00::
with
Vernon
on
the
morning
of
the
regular
tallyho
run
.
This
was be%2:42:03::

hissing hiss%2:32:00::
on
