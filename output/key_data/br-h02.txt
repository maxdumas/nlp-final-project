In
most_of
the
less
developed
countries
,
however
,
such
programing
is be%2:42:03::
at_best
inadequate
and
at_worst
nonexistent
.
Only
a
very_few
of
the
more
advanced
ones
,
such_as
India
and
Pakistan
,
have
developed develop%2:36:00::
systematic
techniques
of
programing
.
Others
have have%2:42:00::
so-called
development
plans
,
but
some
of
these
are be%2:42:06::
little
more_than
lists
of
projects
collected collect%2:35:01::
from
various
ministries
while
others
are be%2:42:06::
statements
of
goals
without
analysis
of
the
actions
required require%2:42:00::
to
attain attain%2:41:00::
them
.
Only
rarely
is
attention
given give%2:32:01::
to
accurate
progress_reports
and
evaluation
.
Neither
growth
nor
a
development
program
can
be
imposed impose%2:41:00::
on
a
country
;
it
must
express express%2:32:01::
the
nation
's
own
will
and
goal
.
Nevertheless
,
we
can
administer administer%2:40:01::
an
aid
program
in
such
a
manner
as
to
promote promote%2:41:01::
the
development
of
responsible
programing
.
First
,
we
can
encourage encourage%2:41:00::
responsibility
by
establishing establish%2:36:01::
as
conditions
for
assistance
on
a
substantial
and
sustained
scale
the
definition
of
objectives
and
the
assessment
of
costs
.
Second
,
we
can
make make%2:30:00::
assistance
for
particular
projects
conditional
on
the
consistency
of
such
projects
with
the
program
.
Third
,
we
can
offer offer%2:40:02::
technical
help
in
the
formulation
of
programs
for
development
which
are
adapted adapt%2:30:01::
to
the
country
's
objectives
and
resources
.
This
includes include%2:42:00::
assistance
in
-
assembling assemble%2:36:00::
the
basic
economic
,
financial
,
technological
,
and
educational
information
on_which
programing
depends depend%2:42:00::
;
surveying survey%2:39:00::
the
needs
and
requirements
over
time
of
broad
sectors
of
the
economy
,
such_as
transport
,
agriculture
,
communication
,
industry
,
and
power
;
designing design%2:36:00::
the
financial
mechanisms
of
the
economy
in
ways
that
will
promote promote%2:41:01::
growth
without
inflation
;
and
administrative
practices
which
will
make make%2:30:00::
possible
the
more
effective
review
and
implementation
of
programs
once
established establish%2:41:00::
.
The
application
of
conditions
in
the
allocation
of
aid
funds
cannot
,
of_course
,
be be%2:42:03::
mechanical
.
It
must
be
recognized recognize%2:31:02::
that
countries
at
different
stages
of
development
have have%2:42:00::
very
different
capabilities
of
meeting meet%2:42:01::
such
conditions
.
To
insist insist%2:32:00::
on
a_level
of
performance
in
programing
and
budgeting
completely
beyond
the
capabilities
of
the
recipient
country
would
result result%2:42:02::
in
the
frustration
of
the
basic
objective
of
our
development
assistance
to
encourage encourage%2:41:00::
more
rapid_growth
.
In
the
more
primitive
areas
,
where
the
capacity
to
absorb absorb%2:31:00::
and
utilize utilize%2:41:00::
external
assistance
is be%2:42:03::
limited
,
some
activities
may
be be%2:42:03::
of
such
obvious
priority
that
we
may
decide decide%2:31:00::
to
support support%2:41:00::
them
before
a
well
worked_out work_out%2:30:00::
program
is be%2:42:03::
available
.
Thus
,
we
might
provide provide%2:40:00::
limited
assistance
in
such
fields
as
education
,
essential
transport
,
communications
,
and
agricultural
improvement
despite
the
absence
of
acceptable
country
programs
.
In
such
a
case
,
however
,
we
would
encourage encourage%2:41:00::
the
recipient
country
to
get_on get_on%2:30:00::
with
its
programing
task
,
supply supply%2:40:00::
it
with
substantial
technical
assistance
in
performing perform%2:36:00::
that
task
,
and
make make%2:30:00::
it
plain
that
an
expansion
or
even
a
continuation
of
our
assistance
to
the
country
's
development
was be%2:42:03::
conditional
upon
programing
progress
being
made make%2:36:08::
.
At
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
,
where
the
more
advanced
countries
can
be
relied_upon rely_upon%2:31:01::
to
make make%2:36:00::
well
thought
through
decisions
as
to
project project%2:32:00::
priorities
within
a
consistent
program
,
we
should
be be%2:42:03::
prepared
to
depart depart%2:42:00::
substantially
from
detailed
project
approval
as
the
basis
for
granting grant%2:32:00::
assistance
and
to
move move%2:41:01::
toward
long-term
support
,
in_cooperation
with
other
developed
countries
,
of
the
essential
foreign_exchange
requirements
of
the
country
's
development
program
.
A
systematic
approach
to
development
budgeting
and
programing
is be%2:42:06::
one
important
kind_of
self-help
.
There
are be%2:42:00::
many
others
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
vitally
important
that
the
new
U._S.
aid
program
should
encourage encourage%2:41:00::
all_of
them
,
since
the
main
thrust
for
development
must
come come%2:42:04::
from
the
less
developed
countries
themselves
.
External
aid
can
only
be be%2:42:03::
marginal
,
although
the
margin
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
Marshall
plan
,
can
be be%2:42:03::
decisive
.
External
aid
can
be be%2:42:03::
effective
only
if
it
is be%2:42:06::
a
complement
to
self-help
.
U._S.
aid
,
therefore
,
should
increasingly
be
designed design%2:36:02::
to
provide provide%2:40:00::
incentives
for
countries
to
take take%2:41:04::
the
steps
that
only
they
themselves
can
take
.
In
establishing establish%2:36:01::
conditions
of
self-help
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
important
that
we
not
expect expect%2:31:00::
countries
to
remake remake%2:36:00::
themselves
in
our
image
.
Open
societies
can
take take%2:30:01::
many
forms
,
and
within
very
broad
limits
recipients
must
be be%2:42:03::
free
to
set set%2:31:04::
their
own
goals
and
to
devise devise%2:36:00::
their
own
institutions
to
achieve achieve%2:41:00::
those
goals
.
On_the_other_hand
,
it
is be%2:42:06::
no
interference
with
sovereignty
to
point_out point_out%2:32:01::
defects
where
they
exist exist%2:42:00::
,
such_as
that
a
plan
calls_for call_for%2:42:00::
factories
without
power
to
run run%2:41:02::
them
,
or
for
institutions
without
trained
personnel
to
staff staff%2:33:00::
them
.
Once
we
have
made make%2:30:00::
clear
that
we
are be%2:42:03::
genuinely
concerned
with
a
country
's
development
potential
,
we
can
be be%2:42:03::
blunt
in
suggesting suggest%2:32:00::
the
technical
conditions
that
must
be
met meet%2:42:01::
for
development
to
occur occur%2:30:00::
.
The
major
areas
of
self-help
are be%2:42:06::
the
following
:
This
includes include%2:42:00::
not_only
development
programing
,
but
also
establishing establish%2:41:00::
tax_policies
designed design%2:36:02::
to
raise raise%2:40:00::
equitably
resources
for
investment
;
fiscal
and
monetary
policies
designed design%2:36:02::
to
prevent prevent%2:41:01::
serious
inflation
;
and
regulatory
policies
aimed aim%2:31:01::
to
attract attract%2:37:01::
the
financial
and
managerial
resources
of
foreign
investment
and
to
prevent prevent%2:41:01::
excessive
luxury
consumption
by
a_few
.
This
includes include%2:31:00::
foreseeing foresee%2:31:00::
balance-of-payments
crises
,
with
adequate
attention
to
reducing reduce%2:30:00::
dependence
on
imports
and
adopting adopt%2:40:02::
realistic
exchange_rates
to
encourage encourage%2:41:00::
infant
industries
and
spur spur%2:41:00::
exports
.
It
also
includes include%2:42:00::
providing_for provide_for%2:42:01::
the
training
of
nationals
to
operate operate%2:41:00::
projects
after
they
are
completed complete%2:30:02::
.
For
both
economic
and
political
reasons
all
segments
of
the
population
must
be be%2:42:03::
able
to
share_in share_in%2:41:00::
the
growth
of
a
country
.
Otherwise
,
development
will
not
lead lead%2:42:12::
to
longrun
stability
.
In
many
societies
,
what
we
regard_as regard_as%2:31:00::
corruption
,
favoritism
,
and
personal
influence
are
so
accepted accept%2:31:00::
as
consistent_with
the
mores
of
officialdom
and
so
integral
a
part
of
routine
administrative
practice
that
any
attempt
to
force force%2:41:00::
their
elimination
will
be
regarded regard%2:31:00::
by
the
local
leadership
as
not_only
unwarranted
but
unfriendly
.
Yet
an
economy
cannot
get get%2:40:00::
the_most
out
of
its
resources
if
dishonesty
,
corruption
,
and
favoritism
are be%2:42:03::
widespread
.
Moreover
,
tolerance
by
us
of
such
practices
results result%2:42:02::
in
serious
waste
and
diversion
of
aid
resources
and
in_the_long_run
generates generate%2:36:02::
anti-American
sentiment
of
a
kind
peculiarly
damaging
to
our
political
interest
.
Some
of
the_most
dramatic
successes
of
communism
in
winning win%2:40:00::
local
support
can
be
traced trace%2:31:00::
to
the
identification
-
correct
or
not
-
of
Communist
regimes
with
personal
honesty
and
pro-Western
regimes
with
corruption
.
A
requirement
of
reasonably
honest
administration
may
be be%2:42:03::
politically
uncomfortable
in
the
short
run
,
but
it
is be%2:42:03::
politically
essential
in_the_long_run
.
The
United_States
can
use use%2:34:01::
its
aid
as
an
incentive
to
self-help
by
responding respond%2:31:00::
with
aid
on
a
sustained
basis
,
tailored tailor%2:30:00::
to
priority
needs
,
to
those
countries
making make%2:41:00::
serious
efforts
in
self-help
.
In
many
instances
it
can
withhold withhold%2:40:00::
or
limit limit%2:41:00::
its
aid
to
countries
not_yet
willing
to
make make%2:41:00::
such
efforts
.
There
are be%2:42:00::
other
countries
where
,
with
skillful
diplomacy
,
we
may
be be%2:42:03::
able
by
our
aid
to
give give%2:40:05::
encouragement
to
those
groups
in
government
which
would
like like%2:37:01::
to
press press%2:32:00::
forward
with
economic
and
social
reform
measures
to
promote promote%2:41:01::
growth
.
Governments
are be%2:42:03::
rarely
monolithic
.
But
there
will
be be%2:42:00::
still
other
countries
where
,
despite
the
inadequacy
of
the
level
of
self-help
,
we
shall
deem deem%2:31:00::
it
wise
,
for
political
or
military
reasons
,
to
give give%2:40:05::
substantial
economic
assistance
.
Even
in
these
cases
we
should
promote promote%2:41:01::
self-help
by
making make%2:30:00::
it
clear
that
our
supporting
assistance
is be%2:42:03::
subject
to
reduction
and
ultimately
to
termination
.
The_most
fundamental
concept
of
the
new
approach
to
economic
aid
is be%2:42:06::
the
focusing
of
our
attention
,
our
resources
,
and
our
energies
on
the
effort
to
promote promote%2:41:01::
the
economic
and
social
development
of
the
less
developed
countries
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
not
a
short-run
goal
.
To
have have%2:40:00::
any
success
in_this
effort
,
we
must
ourselves
view view%2:31:00::
it
as
an
enterprise
stretching stretch%2:29:01::
over
a
considerable
number
of
years
,
and
we
must
encourage encourage%2:41:00::
the
recipients
of
our
aid
to
view view%2:31:00::
it
in
the
same
fashion
.
How
long
it
will
take take%2:40:06::
to
show show%2:39:02::
substantial
success
in_this
effort
will
vary vary%2:42:00::
greatly
from
country
to
country
.
In
several
significant
cases
,
such_as
India
,
a
decade
of
concentrated
effort
can
launch launch%2:35:00::
these
countries
into
a
stage
in_which
they
can
carry carry%2:41:00::
forward
their
own
economic
and
social
progress
with
little
or
no
government-to-government
assistance
.
These
cases
in_which
light
is be%2:42:03::
already
visible
at
the
other
end
of
the
tunnel
are be%2:42:06::
ones
which
over
the
next
few
years
will
absorb absorb%2:40:00::
the
bulk
of
our
capital
assistance
.
The
number
of
countries
thus
favorably
situated
is be%2:42:03::
small
,
but
their
peoples
constitute constitute%2:42:00::
over
half
of
the
population
of
the
underdeveloped
world
.
Meantime
,
over
the
decade
of
the
sixties
,
we
can
hope hope%2:37:01::
that
many
other
countries
will
ready ready%2:30:00::
themselves
for
the
big
push
into
self-sustaining
growth
.
In
still
others
which
are be%2:42:03::
barely
on
the
threshold
of
the
transition
into
modernity
,
the
decade
can
bring bring%2:35:04::
significant
progress
in
launching launch%2:41:01::
the
slow
process
of
developing develop%2:36:01::
their
human
resources
and
their
basic
services
to_the_point
where
an
expanded
range
of
developmental
activities
is be%2:42:03::
possible
.
The
whole
program
must
be
conceived_of conceive_of%2:36:01::
as
an
effort
,
stretching stretch%2:42:00::
over
a
considerable
number
of
years
,
to
alter alter%2:30:01::
the
basic
social
and
economic_conditions
in
the
less
developed
world
.
It
must
be
recognized recognize%2:31:02::
as
a
slow-acting
tool
designed design%2:36:02::
to
prevent prevent%2:41:01::
political
and
military
crises
such_as
those
recently
confronted confront%2:32:00::
in
Laos
and
Cuba
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
not
a
tool
for
dealing deal%2:41:09::
with
these
crises
after
they
have
erupted erupt%2:30:01::
.
Many_of
the
individual
projects
for
which
development
assistance
is
required require%2:42:00::
call_for call_for%2:42:00::
expenditures
over
lengthy
periods
.
Dams
,
river
development
schemes
,
transportation
networks
,
educational
systems
require require%2:42:00::
years
to
construct construct%2:36:00::
.
Moreover
,
on
complex
projects
,
design
work
must
be
completed complete%2:30:02::
and
orders
for
machinery
and
equipment
placed
months
or
even
years
before
construction
can
commence commence%2:36:00::
.
Thus
,
as
a
development
program
is
being
launched launch%2:41:01::
,
commitments
and
obligations
must
be
entered enter%2:38:00::
into
in
a
given
year
which
may
exceed exceed%2:42:01::
by
twofold
or
threefold
the
expenditures
to
be
made make%2:41:00::
in_that
year
.
The
capital
expansion
programs
of
business_firms
involve involve%2:42:00::
multi-year
budgeting
and
the
same
is be%2:42:03::
true
of
country
development
programs
.
More
importantly
,
several
of
the
more
advanced
of
the
less
developed
countries
have
found find%2:36:00::
through
experience
that
they
must
plan plan%2:31:00::
their
own
complex
investment
programs
for
at_least
5
years
forward
and
tentatively
for
considerably
more_than
that
if
they
are
to
be be%2:42:03::
sure
that
the
various
interdependent
activities
involved
are be%2:42:03::
all
to
take_place take_place%2:30:00::
in
the
proper
sequence
.
Without
such
forward
planning
,
investment_funds
are
wasted waste%2:34:05::
because
manufacturing

are
completed complete%2:30:02::
before

before
there

plants
available
in_which
they
can
be
employed employ%2:41:00::

Most
important
of
all
,
the
less
developed
countries
must
be
persuaded persuade%2:32:00::
to
take take%2:41:04::
the
necessary
steps
to
allocate allocate%2:40:00::

They

the
necessary

regulatory
policies

They
must
be

to
adopt adopt%2:40:02::
the
other
necessary
self-help
measures
which
are
described describe%2:32:00::
in
the
preceding
section

The
taking
of
these
steps
involves involve%2:42:00::
tough

Moreover
,
once
these
steps
are
taken take%2:41:04::
,
they
may
require require%2:42:00::
years
to
make make%2:30:00::

They
must
,
therefore
,
be

If
