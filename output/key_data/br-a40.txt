somewhat
of

,
Thompson
,
at
61
,
is be%2:42:07::
something
of
a
legend
in

lifetime

He
made make%2:40:01::
his
fortune

when

took_over take_over%2:41:01::

hit hit%2:38:00::
big
money
,
he
had
begun begin%2:30:00::
buying buy%2:40:00::
modern

He
gave give%2:32:00::
the
impression
of
never
having
read read%2:31:00::
a
word
about
art
,
but
there
was be%2:42:00::
no_doubt
that
he
had have%2:40:04::
an
eye
for
the
best
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
able
to
smell smell%2:39:00::
a
bargain

and
a
masterpiece
-
a
continent
away
,

,
start start%2:30:00::
haggling haggle%2:40:00::
over
prices
without
so_much

He
could
be be%2:42:03::
lavishly
generous

friends
,
cab

bellboys
,

with
dealers
he
was be%2:42:03::

he
insisted insist%2:32:00::
that
it
be
housed house%2:42:02::
in

museum

Pittsburgh
turned turn_down%2:40:00::

down
,
just_as

society
had
been
snubbing snub%2:32:01::
him
for
years

went go_to%2:38:00::
then
to
a

year-old
Basel
art_dealer
named name%2:32:03::
Ernst_Beyeler
,
with
whom
he
had

At

scarcely
glanced glance%2:39:00::
at
the
treasures
that

In_fact

seemed seem%2:39:00::
delighted
to
get_rid_of get_rid_of%2:40:01::

Some
observers
speculated speculate%2:31:01::
that
this
might
be be%2:42:07::
his
revenge
on

The
University
of

has

claimed claim%2:32:00::
that
it
does
not
discriminate discriminate%2:41:12::
against
any
applicant
on
the
basis
of
race
or
color

But
in_all
its
175
years
,
not
a
single
Negro
student
has
entered enter%2:38:00::
its
classrooms
.
Last
week
Federal_District
Judge_William_A._Bootle
ordered order%2:32:01::
the
university
to
admit admit%2:41:01::
immediately
a
``
qualified
''
Negro
boy
and
girl
.
Their
entry
will
crack crack%2:30:09::
the
total
segregation
of

education

from

in
Georgia

and
in
Alabama

Mississippi

For
18
months
,
Hamilton_Holmes
,
19
,
and
Charlayne_Hunter
,
18
,
had
tried try%2:41:00::
to
get_into get_into%2:40:00::
the
university
.
They
graduated graduate%2:40:00::
together
from
Atlanta
's
Turner
High_School
,
where
Valedictorian_Holmes
was be%2:42:03::
first
in
the
class
and
Charlayne
third
.
The
university
rejected reject%2:40:00::
them
on
a
variety
of
pretexts
,
but
was be%2:42:03::
careful
never
to
mention mention%2:32:00::
the
color
of
their
skins
.
Holmes
went_to go_to%2:42:00::
Atlanta
's
Morehouse
(
Negro
)
College
,
where
he
is be%2:42:07::
a
B
+
student
and
star
halfback
.
Charlayne
studied study%2:31:03::
journalism
at
Detroit
's
Wayne_State_University
.
Last
fall
,
after
they
took
their
hopes
for
entering enter%2:41:06::
Georgia
to
court
,
Judge_Bootle
ordered order%2:32:01::
them
to
apply apply%2:32:00::
again
.
Charlayne
was
``
tentatively
''
admitted admit%2:41:01::
for
next
fall
,
after
state
investigators
questioned question%2:32:03::
her
white
roommate
at
Wayne_State
.
But
Holmes
was
rejected reject%2:40:00::
again
``
on
the
basis
of
his
record
and
interview
''
.
The
evidence
in
court
was be%2:42:07::
testimony
about
the
interview
,
which
for
Holmes
lasted last%2:42:00::
an
hour
,
although
at_least
one
white
student
at
Georgia
got_through get_through%2:30:00::
this
ritual
by
a
simple
phone
conversation
.
Holmes
was
asked ask%2:32:00::
if
he
had
ever
visited visit%2:41:02::
a
house_of_prostitution
,
or
a
``
beatnik
parlor
or
teahouse
''
.
No
,
said say%2:32:00::
he
,
but
officials
still
called call%2:32:00::
him
``
evasive
''
.
They
also
said say%2:32:00::
he
lied lie%2:32:00::
in
saying say%2:32:01::
that
he
had
never
been
``
arrested arrest%2:35:00::
''
.
Their
reason
:
Holmes
once
paid pay%2:40:00::
a
$
20
speeding
fine
,
had have%2:30:01::
his
license
suspended suspend%2:30:00::
.
Negro
lawyers
dug_into dig_into%2:35:00::
the
records
of
300
white
students
,
found find%2:31:09::
that
many
were
hardly
interviewed interview%2:32:01::
at_all
-
and
few
had have%2:42:00::
academic
records
as_good_as
Hamilton_Holmes
.
The
real
reason
for
his
rejection
,
they
argued argue%2:32:02::
,
is be%2:42:03::
the
fact
that
Georgia
law
automatically
cuts_off cut_off%2:32:00::
funds
for
any
desegregated
school
.
Judge_Bootle
's
decision
:
``
The
two
plaintiffs
are be%2:42:03::
qualified
for
admission
to
said
university
and
would
already
have
been
admitted admit%2:41:01::
had
it
not
been be%2:42:00::
for

The
state
will
appeal appeal%2:41:00::
