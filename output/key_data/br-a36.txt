THE
RECENT
publicity
attending attend%2:42:01::
the
successful
federal
prosecution
of
a
conspiracy
indictment
against
a_number_of
electrical
manufacturers
has
evoked evoke%2:37:00::

neither
by

nor
by
the
results

The
anti-trust
laws
inform inform%2:32:00::
a
business
that
it
must
compete compete%2:33:00::
,
but
along
completely
undefined
lines
;
it
must
play play%2:33:00::
a
game
in_which
there
never
is be%2:42:04::
a
winner
.
The
fact
is be%2:42:03::
that
any
business
that
wants want%2:37:00::
to
operate operate%2:41:00::
successfully
cannot
follow follow%2:41:00::
the
law
.
Hypocrisy
thus
becomes become%2:30:00::
the
answer
to
a
foolish
public
policy
.
Let
us
look_at look_at%2:31:00::
the
heavy-electrical-goods
industry
in_which
General_Electric
,
Westinghouse
and
a_number_of
other
manufacturers
were
recently
convicted convict%2:32:00::
of
engaging engage%2:41:06::
in
a
conspiracy
to
rig rig%2:40:00::
prices
and
allocate allocate%2:40:00::
the
market
.
The
industry
is be%2:42:03::
so
structured
that
price-setting
by
a
multi-product
company
will
vary vary%2:30:01::
with
the
way
overhead
charges
are
allocated allocate%2:40:00::
-
whether
marginal
or
average
pricing
is
applied apply%2:34:00::
.
The
problem
becomes become%2:30:00::
even
more
complex
where
an
enterprise
is
engaged engage%2:41:06::
in
the
manufacture
of
a
wide
variety
of
other
goods
in_addition
to
the
heavy
electrical
equipment
.
Accounting
procedures
can
be
varied vary%2:30:01::
to
provide provide%2:40:00::
a
rationale
for
almost
any
price
.
Naturally
,
enterprises
of
the
size
of
General_Electric
are be%2:42:03::
in
a
position
to
structure structure%2:30:00::
their
prices
in_such_a_way
that
the
relatively
small
competitors
can
be
forced force%2:35:02::
to
the
wall
in
a
very
short_time
.
Should
these
giants
really
flex flex%2:38:01::
their
competitive
muscles
,
they
would
become become%2:30:00::
the
only
survivors
in
the
industry
.
Uncle_Sam
would
then
accuse accuse%2:32:00::
them
of
creating create%2:36:00::
a
monopoly
by
``
unfair
competition
''
.
But
if
they
show show%2:39:03::
self-restraint
,
they
do
n't
get get%2:40:00::
the
orders
.
Under_the_circumstances
,
the
only
protection
for
the
relatively
small
manufacturers
is
to
engage engage%2:41:06::
in
exactly
the
kind_of
conspiracy
with
the
giants
for
which
the
latter
were
convicted convict%2:32:00::
.
Engaging engage%2:41:06::
in
such
a
conspiracy
was be%2:42:03::
an
act
of
mercy
by
the
giants
.
The
paradox
implicit_in
the
whole
affair
is
shown show%2:39:02::
by
the
demand
of
the
government
,
after
the
conviction
,
that
General_Electric
sign sign%2:41:00::
a
wide-open
consent
decree
that
it
would
not
reduce reduce%2:30:00::
prices
so
low
as
to
compete compete%2:33:00::
seriously
with
its
fellows
.
In_other_words
,
the
anti-trust
laws
,
designed design%2:31:00::
to
reduce reduce%2:30:00::
prices
to
the
consumer
on
Monday
,
Wednesday
and
Friday
,
become become%2:30:00::
a
tool
to
protect protect%2:33:00::
the
marginal
manufacturer
on
Tuesday
,
Thursday
and
Saturday
.
And
which
theory
would
govern govern%2:41:01::
the
enforcers
of
the
law
on
Sunday
?
The
question
might
be
asked ask%2:32:00::
:
``
Do
n't
the
managements
of
the
heavy-electrical-goods
manufacturers
know know%2:31:01::
these
facts
?
Why
did
they
engage engage%2:41:06::
in
a
flood
of
mea
culpas
,
throw throw%2:35:00::
a_few
scapegoats
to
the
dogs
and
promise promise%2:32:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
good
boys
thereafter
,
expressing express%2:32:00::
their
complete
confidence
in
the
laws
''
?
The
past
usefulness
of
the
anti-trust
laws
to
management
was
explained explain%2:32:00::
by
Thurman_Arnold
,
in
The
Folklore
of
Capitalism
,
back
in
1937
.
He
wrote write%2:36:02::
:
``
the
anti-trust
laws
were be%2:42:03::
the
answer
of
a
society
which
unconsciously
felt feel%2:37:00::
the
need
of
great
organizations
,
and
at_the_same_time
had
to
deny deny%2:40:00::
them
a
place
in
the
moral
and
logical
ideology
of
the
social_structure
.
Anti-trust
laws
became become%2:30:00::
the
greatest
protection
to
uncontrolled
business
dictatorship
.
When
corporate
abuses
were
attacked attack%2:33:01::
,
it
was
done do%2:41:01::
on
the
theory
that
criminal
penalties
would
be
invoked invoke%2:36:00::
rather_than
control
.
In_this
manner
,
every
scheme
for
direct
control
broke break%2:30:00::
to_pieces
on
the
great
protective
rock
of
the
anti-trust
laws
.
In_any_event
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
obvious
that
the
anti-trust
laws
did
not
prevent prevent%2:41:01::
the
formation
of
some
of
the
greatest
financial
empires
the
world
has
ever
known know%2:31:03::
,
held hold%2:42:00::
together
by
some
of
the_most
fantastic
ideas
,
all
based base%2:31:00::
on
the
fundamental
notion
that
a
corporation
is be%2:42:03::
an
individual
who
can
trade trade%2:40:00::
and
exchange exchange%2:30:00::
goods
without
control
by
the
government
''
.
This
escape
from
control
has
led lead%2:42:04::
to
management
's
evaluating evaluate%2:31:00::
the
risk
of
occasional
irrational
prosecution
as
worth

.
A
plea
of
nolo_contendere

followed follow%2:42:00::
by
a
nominal
fine
,
after_all
is be%2:42:03::
a
small
price
to
pay pay%2:32:00::
for
this
untrammeled
license
.
(
The
penalties
handed_out hand_out%2:40:00::
in
the
electrical
case
,
which
included include%2:42:00::
jail
sentences
,
were be%2:42:03::
unprecedented
in
anti-trust
prosecutions
,
perhaps
because
the
conspirators
had
displayed display%2:39:01::
unusual
ineptness
in
their
pricing
activities
.
)
If
a
substitute
mechanism
is
needed need%2:34:00::
for
the
control
of
a
fictitious
impersonal
market
,
quite
obviously
some
method
must
be
devised devise%2:36:00::
for
representing represent%2:32:00::
the
public
interest
.
A
secret
conspiracy
of
manufacturers
is be%2:42:03::
hardly
such
a
vehicle
.
However
,
one
can
argue argue%2:32:02::
that
no
such
control
is be%2:42:03::
necessary
as
long
as
one
pretends pretend%2:32:00::
that
the
anti-trust
laws
are be%2:42:03::
effective
and
rational
.
Quite
clearly
the
anti-trust
laws
are be%2:42:03::
neither
effective
nor
rational
-
and
yet
the
argument
goes go%2:42:02::
that
they
should
be
extended extend%2:40:05::
to
the
labor_union
.
Those
who
favor favor%2:31:00::
placing place%2:41:01::
trade_unions
under
anti-trust
laws
imply imply%2:32:00::
that
they
are

a
brand

reform

Before
1933
,
individuals
who
opposed oppose%2:32:01::
trade_unions
and
collective_bargaining
said say%2:32:00::
so
in
plain
English

The
acceptance
of
collective_bargaining
as
a
national
policy
in
1934
,
implicit_in
the
writing write%2:36:00::
of
Section
7
A
of
the
National_Industrial_Recovery_Act

has
made make%2:30:00::
it
impolitic

oppose oppose%2:32:01::
collective_bargaining
in_principle
.
The
Wagner_Act
,
the
Taft-Hartley_Act
and
the
Landrum-Griffin_Act
all
endorse endorse%2:41:00::
the
principle
of
collective_bargaining
.
The
basic
purpose
of
an
effective
collective-bargaining
system
is be%2:42:03::
the
removal
of
wages
from
competition
.
If
a
union
cannot
perform perform%2:41:02::
this
function
,
then
collective_bargaining
is
being
palmed_off palm_off%2:40:00::
by
organizers
as
a
gigantic
fraud

The
tortured
reasoning
that
unions
use use%2:34:01::
to
deny deny%2:32:00::
their
ambition
to
exercise exercise%2:34:00::
monopoly
power
over
the
supply
and
price
of
labor
is be%2:42:03::
one
of
the
things
that
create create%2:36:00::
a
legal_profession
.
The
problem
must
be
faced face%2:32:00::
squarely
.
If
laborers
are be%2:42:03::
merely
commodities
competing compete%2:33:00::
against
each
other
in
a
market
place
like
so
many
bags
of
wheat
and
corn
(
unsupported
,
by_the_way
,
by
any
agricultural
subsidy
)
,
then
they
may
be
pardoned pardon%2:32:01::
for
reacting react%2:31:00::
with
complete
antagonism

a
system
that
imposes impose%2:32:00::

Human
labor
was be%2:42:03::
exactly
that
