It
was be%2:42:03::
a
fortunate
time
in_which
to
build build%2:36:00::
,
for
the
seventeenth
century
was be%2:42:03::
a
great
period
in
Persian
art
.
The
architects
,
the
tile
and
carpet
makers
,
the
potters
,
painters
,
calligraphers
,
and
metalsmiths
worked work%2:41:02::
through
Abbas
's
reign
and
those
of
his
successors
to
enrich enrich%2:30:00::
the
city
.
Travelers
entering enter%2:38:00::
from
the
desert
were
confounded confound%2:31:02::
by
what
must
have
seemed seem%2:39:00::
an
illusion
:
a
great
garden
filled fill%2:42:00::
with
nightingales
and
roses
,
cut cut%2:35:00::
by
canals
and
terraced
promenades
,
studded stud%2:42:00::
with
water_tanks
of
turquoise
tile
in_which
were
reflected reflect%2:39:00::
the
glistening
blue
curves
of
a_hundred
domes
.
At
the
heart
of
all_of
this
was be%2:42:05::
the
square
,
which
one
such
traveler
declared declare%2:32:04::
to
be be%2:42:03::
``
as
spacious
,
as
pleasant
and
aromatick
a
Market
as
any
in
the
Universe
''
.
In_time
Isfahan
came come%2:30:03::
to
be be%2:42:03::
known
as
``
half
the
world
''
,
Isfahan_nisf-i-jahan
.
In
the
early
eighteenth
century
this
fantastic
city
,
then
the
size
of
London
,
started start%2:30:00::
to
decline decline%2:30:01::
.
The
Afghans
invaded invade%2:33:00::
;
the
Safavids
fell fall%2:41:00::
from
power
;
the
capital
went go%2:30:04::
elsewhere
;
the
desert
encroached encroach%2:38:00::
.
Isfahan
became become%2:42:01::
more
of
a
legend
than
a
place
,
and
now
it
is be%2:42:03::
for
many
people
simply
a
name
to_which
they
attach attach%2:35:00::
their
notions
of
old
Persia
and
sometimes
of
the
East
.
They
think_of think_of%2:31:01::
it
as
a
kind_of
spooky
museum
in_which
they
may
half
see see%2:39:00::
and
half
imagine imagine%2:36:00::
the
old
splendor
.
Those
who
actually
get get%2:38:00::
there
find find%2:39:01::
that
it
is be%2:42:03::
n't
spooky
at_all
but
as
brilliant
as
a
tile
in
sunlight
.
But
even
for
them
it
remains remain%2:30:00::
a
museum
,
or
perhaps
it
would
be be%2:42:03::
more
accurate
to
say say%2:32:00::
a
tomb
,
a
tomb
in_which
Persia
lies lie%2:42:03::
well
preserved
but
indeed
dead
.
Everyone
is be%2:42:03::
ready
to
grant grant%2:40:01::
the
Persians
their
history
,
but
almost_no
one
is be%2:42:03::
willing
to
acknowledge acknowledge%2:31:00::
their
present
.
It
seems seem%2:39:01::
that
for
Persia
,
and
especially
for
this
city
,
there
are be%2:42:00::
only
two_times
:
the
glorious
past
and
the
corrupt
,
depressing
,
sterile
present
.
The
one
apparent
connection
between
the
two
is be%2:42:06::
a
score
of
buildings
which
somehow
or
other
have
survived survive%2:42:00::
and
which
naturally
enough
are_called
``
historical
monuments
''
.
However
,
just_as
all
the
buildings
have
not
fallen fall%2:41:00::
and
flowed flow%2:38:00::
back
to
their
original
mud
,
so
the
values
which
wanted want%2:34:00::
them
and
saw see%2:31:03::
that
they
were_built
have
not
all
disappeared disappear%2:30:00::
.
The
values
and
talents
which
made make%2:36:01::
the
tile
and
the
dome
,
the
rug
,
the
poem
and
the
miniature
,
continue continue%2:42:01::
in
certain
social
institutions
which
rise rise%2:42:00::
above
the
ordinary
life
of_this
city
,
as
the
great
buildings
rise rise%2:42:00::
above
blank
walls
and
dirty
lanes
.
Often
,
too
,
the
social
institutions
are
housed house%2:42:02::
in
these
pavilions
and
palaces
and
bridges
,
for
these
great
structures
are be%2:42:03::
not
simply
``
historical
monuments
''
;
they
are be%2:42:06::
the
places
where
Persians
live live%2:42:08::
.
The
promenade
,
for_example
,
continues continue%2:42:01::
to
take_place take_place%2:30:00::
on
the
Chahar_Bagh
,
a
mile-long
garden
of
plane
and
poplar_trees
that
now
serves serve%2:42:03::
as
the
city
's
principal
street
.
?
t
takes_place take_place%2:30:00::
as_well
along
the
terraces
and
through
the
arcades
of
the
Khaju
bridge
,
and
also
in
the
gardens
of
the
square
.
On
Fridays
,
the
day
when
many
Persians
relax relax%2:29:00::
with
poetry
,
talk
,
and
a
samovar
,
people
do
not
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
true
,
stream stream%2:38:03::
into
Chehel_Sotun
-
a
pavilion
and
garden
built build%2:36:00::
by
Shah_Abbas
2
,
in
the
seventeenth
century
-
but
they
do
retire retire%2:41:02::
into
hundreds
of
pavilions
throughout
the
city
and
up
the
river
valley
,
which
are be%2:42:03::
smaller
,
more
humble
copies
of
the
former
.
And
of_course
religious
life
continues continue%2:42:01::
to
center center%2:42:00::
in
the
more
famous
mosques
,
and
commercial
life
-
very_much
a
social
institution
-
in
the
bazaar
.
Those
three
other
great
activities
of
the
Persians
,
the
bath
,
the
teahouse
,
and
the
zur
khaneh
(
the
latter
a
kind_of
club
in_which
a
leader
and
a
group
of
men
in
an
octagonal
pit
move move%2:41:01::
through
a
rite
of
calisthenics
,
dance
,
chanted
poetry
,
and
music
)
,
do
not
take_place take_place%2:30:00::
in
buildings
to_which
entrance
tickets
are
sold sell%2:40:00::
,
but
some
of
them
occupy occupy%2:42:00::
splendid
examples
of
Persian
domestic
architecture
:
long
,
domed
,
chalk-white
rooms
with
daises
of
turquoise
tile
,
their
end
walls
cut_through cut_through%2:38:00::
to
the
orchards
and
the
sky
by
open
arches
.
But
more
important
,
and
the
thing
which
the
casual
traveler
and
the
blind
sojourner
often
do
not
see see%2:39:00::
,
is be%2:42:06::
that
these
places
and
activities
are be%2:42:02::
often
the
settings
in_which
Persians
exercise exercise%2:34:00::
their
extraordinary
aesthetic
sensibilities
.
Water
,
air
,
fruit
,
poetry
,
music
,
the
human
form
-
these
things
are be%2:42:03::
important
to
Persians
,
and
they
experience experience%2:31:00::
them
with
an
intense
and
discriminating
awareness
.
I
should
like like%2:37:01::
,
by_the_way
,
to
make make%2:30:00::
it
clear
that
I
am
not
using use%2:34:01::
the
word
``
Persians
''
carelessly
.
I
do
n't
mean mean%2:32:01::
a_few
aesthetes
who
play play%2:41:03::
about
with
sensations
,
like
a
young
prince
in
a
miniature
dabbling dabble%2:38:00::
his
hand
in
a
pool
.
These
things
are be%2:42:03::
important
to
almost
all
Persians
and
perhaps
most
important
to
the_most
ordinary
.
The
men
crying cry%2:32:01::
love
poems
in
an
orchard
on
any
summer
's
night
are be%2:42:06::
as
often
as
not
the
lutihaw
,
mustachioed
toughs
who
spend spend%2:42:00::
most_of
their
lives
in
and
out
of
the
local
prisons
,
brothels
,
and
teahouses
.
A_few
months
ago
it
was
a
fairly
typical
landlord
who
in
the
dead
of
night
lugged lug%2:35:00::
me
up
a
mountainside
to
drink drink%2:34:00::
from
a
spring
famous
in
the
neighborhood
for
its
clarity
and
flavor
.
Not_long
ago
an
acquaintance
,
a
slick-headed
water_rat
of
a
lad
up
from
the
maw
of
the
city
,
stood stand%2:35:00::
on
the
balcony
puffing puff%2:34:01::
his
first
cigarette
in
weeks
.
The
air
,
he
said say%2:32:00::
,
was be%2:42:03::
just_right
;
a
cigarette
would
taste taste%2:39:02::
particularly
good
.
I
really
did
n't
know know%2:31:01::
what
he
meant mean%2:32:01::
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
a
nice
day
,
granted
.
But
he
knew know%2:31:03::
;
he
sniffed sniff%2:39:00::
the
air
and
licked lick%2:35:00::
it
on
his
lip
and
knew know%2:31:03::
as
a
vintner
knows know%2:31:03::
a
vintage
.
The
natural
world
then
,
plus
poetry
and
some
kinds
of
art
,
receives receive%2:30:01::
from
the_most
ordinary
of
Persians
a
great_deal
of
attention
.
The
line
of
an
eyebrow
,
the
color
of
the
skin
,
a
ghazal
from
Hafiz
,
the
purity
of
spring_water
,
the
long
afternoon
among
the
boughs
which
crowd
the
upper
story
of
a
pavilion
-
these
things
are
noticed notice%2:39:00::
,
judged judge%2:31:00::
,
and
valued value%2:40:00::
.
Nowhere
in
Isfahan
is
this
rich
aesthetic
life
of
the
Persians
shown show%2:32:00::
so
well
as
during
the
promenade
at
the
Khaju
bridge
.
There
has
probably
always
been be%2:42:04::
a
bridge
of
some
sort
at
the
southeastern
corner
of
the
city
.
For_one_thing
,
there
is be%2:42:04::
a
natural
belt
of
rock
across
the
river_bed
;
for
another
,
it
was
here
that
one
of
the
old
caravan
routes
came_in come_in%2:38:02::
.
It
was
to
provide provide%2:40:00::
a
safe
and
spacious
crossing
for
these
caravans
,
and
also
to
make make%2:36:00::
a
pleasance
for
the
city
,
that
Shah_Abbas
2
,
in
about
1657
built build%2:36:00::
,
of
sun-baked
brick
,
tile
,
and
stone
,
the
present
bridge
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
a
splendid
structure
.
From
upstream
it
looks_like look_like%2:42:00::
a
long
arcaded
box
laid lay%2:35:00::
across
the
river
;
from
downstream
,
where
the
water_level
is be%2:42:03::
much
lower
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
a
high
,
elaborately
facaded
pavilion
.
The
top
story
contains contain%2:42:00::
more_than
thirty
alcoves
separated separate%2:35:02::
from
each
other
by
spandrels
of
blue
and
yellow
tile
.
At
either
end
and
in_the_center
there
are be%2:42:04::
bays
which
contain contain%2:42:00::
nine
greater
alcoves
as
frescoed
and
capacious
as
church
apses
.
Here
,
in
the
old
days
-
when
they
had
come come%2:38:00::
to
see see%2:39:00::
the
moon
or
displays
of
fireworks
-
sat sit%2:35:00::
the
king
and
his
court
while
priests
,
soldiers
,
and
other
members
of
the
party
lounged lounge%2:35:00::
in
the
smaller
alcoves
between
.
Below
,
twenty
vaults
tunnel tunnel%2:38:00::
through
the
understructure
of
the
bridge
.
These
are
traversed traverse%2:42:00::
by
another
line
of
vaults
,
and
thus
rooms
,
arched arch%2:38:00::
on
all
four
sides
,
are
formed form%2:42:00::
.
Down
through
the
axis
of
the
bridge
there
is be%2:42:04::
a
long
diminishing
vista
like
a
visual
echo
of
piers
and
arches
,
while
the
vaults
fronting front%2:42:00::
upstream
and
down
frame frame%2:42:00::
the
sunset
and
sunrise
,
the
mountains
and
river
pools
.
Here
,
on
the
hottest
day
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
cool
beneath
the
stone
and
fresh
from
the
water
flowing flow%2:38:00::
in
the
sluices
at
the
bottom
of
the
vaults
.
On
the
downstream
,
or
``
pavilion
''
,
side
these
vaults
give give%2:38:00::
out
onto
terraces
twice_as
wide
as
the
bridge
itself
.
From
the
terraces
-
eighteen
in_all
-
broad
flights_of_steps
descend descend%2:38:00::
into
the
water
or
onto
still
more
terraces
barely
above
the
level
of
the
river
.
Out
of
water
,
brick
,
and
tile
they
have
made make%2:36:00::
far
more_than
just
a
bridge
.
On
spring
and
summer
evenings
people
leave leave%2:38:01::
their
shops
and
houses
and
walk walk%2:38:00::
up
through
the
lanes
of
the
city
to
the
bridge
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
a
great
spectacle
.
The
bridge
itself
rises rise%2:38:00::
up
from
the
river
,
light-flared
and
enormous
,
like
the
outdoor
set
for
an
epic
opera
.
Crowds
press press%2:38:00::
along
the
terraces
,
down
the
steps
,
in
and
out
of
the
arcades
,
massing mass%2:38:00::
against
it
as
though
it
were be%2:42:03::
a
fortress
under
siege
.
All
kinds
come come%2:38:00::
to
walk walk%2:38:00::
in
the
promenade
:
merchants
from
the
bazaar
bickering bicker%2:32:00::
over
a
deal
;
a
Bakhtiari
khan
in
a
cap
and
hacking
jacket
;
dervishes
who
stand stand%2:35:00::
with
the
stillness
of
the
blind
,
their
eyes
filmed
with
rheum
and
visions
;
the
old
Kajar
princes
arriving arrive%2:38:00::
in
their
ancient
limousines
;
students
,
civil_servants
,
beggars
,
musicians
,
hawkers
,
and
clowns
.
Families
go go%2:38:00::
out
to
the
edge
of
the
terraces
to
sit sit%2:35:00::
on
carpets
around
a
samovar
.
Below
,
people
line line%2:42:00::
the
steps
,
as
though
on
bleachers
,
to
watch watch%2:39:00::
the
sky
and
river
.
Above
,
in
the
tiled
prosceniums
of
the
alcoves
,
boys
sing sing%2:36:01::
the
ghazals
of
Hafiz
and
Saadi
,
while
at
the
very
bottom
,
in
the
vaults
,
the
toughs
and
blades
of
the
city
hoot hoot%2:32:00::
and
bang bang%2:35:00::
their
drums
,
drink drink%2:34:00::
arak
,
play play%2:33:00::
dice
,
and
dance dance%2:38:01::
.
Here
in
an
evening
Persians
enjoy enjoy%2:37:00::
many_of
the
things
which
are be%2:42:03::
important
to
them
:
poetry
,
water
,
the
moon
,
a
beautiful
face
.
To
a
stranger
their
delight
in
these
things
may
seem seem%2:39:00::
paradoxical
,
for
Persians
chase chase%2:38:00::
the
golden_calf
as
much_as
any
people
.
Many_of
them
,
moreover
,
are
beginning begin%2:30:00::
to
complain complain%2:32:00::
about
the
scarcity
of
Western
amusements
and
to
ridicule ridicule%2:32:00::
the
old
life
of
the
bazaar
merchant
,
the
mullah
,
and
the
peasant
.
Nonetheless
,
they
take
time_out
-
much
time
-
from
the
game
of
grab
and
these
new
Western
experiments
to
go_to go_to%2:38:00::
the
gardens
and
riverbanks
.
Above_all
,
they
will
stop stop%2:30:05::
in_the_middle
of
anything
,
anywhere
,
to
hear hear%2:39:00::
or
quote quote%2:32:00::
some
poetry
.
Poetry
in
Persian
life
is be%2:42:03::
far
more_than
a
common
ground
on_which
-
in
a
society
deeply
fissured
by
antagonisms
-
all
may
stand stand%2:42:03::
.
It
contains contain%2:42:13::
,
in_fact
,
their
whole
outlook
on
life
.
And
it
is
expressed express%2:32:02::
,
at_least
to
their
taste
,
in
a
perfect
form
.
Poetry
for
a
Persian
is be%2:42:03::
nothing
less_than
truth
and
beauty
.
In
most
Western
cultures
today
these
twins
have
been
sent send%2:38:01::
away
to
the
libraries
and
museums
.
In
Persia
,
where
practically
speaking speak%2:32:01::
there
are be%2:42:04::
no
museums
or
libraries
or
,
for_that_matter
,
hardly_any
books
,
the
twins
run run%2:38:00::
free
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
perhaps
difficult
to
conceive conceive%2:36:00::
,
but
imagine imagine%2:36:00::
that
tonight
on
London
bridge
the
Teddy_boys
of
the
East

Marlowe
,
Herrick
,
Shakespeare
,
and
perhaps
some
lyrics
of
their
own
.
That
,
at_any_rate
,
is be%2:42:06::
what
happens happen%2:30:00::
at
the
Khaju
bridge
.
Boys
and
men
go go%2:38:00::
along
the
riverbank
or
to
the
alcoves
in
the
top
arcade
.
Here
in
these
little
rooms
-
or
stages
arched
open_to
the
sky
and
river
-
they
choose choose%2:31:00::
a_few
lines
out
of
the
hundreds
they
may
know know%2:31:03::
and
sing sing%2:36:01::
them
according
to
one
of
the
modes
into
which
Persian
music
is be%2:42:03::
divided
.
Each
mode
is
believed believe%2:31:00::
to
have have%2:40:00::
a
specific
attribute
-
one

and_so_on

to
include include%2:42:00::
all_of
the
emotions
.
The
singer
simply
matches match%2:30:01::
the
poem
to
a
mode
;
for_example
,
the
mode
of
bravery
to
this
anonymous
folk
poem
:
``
They
brought bring%2:38:00::
me
news
that
Spring
is be%2:42:05::
in
the
plains
And
Ahmad

;
Go go%2:38:00::
,
tell tell%2:32:00::
his

mother
that
her
son
Fought fight%2:33:00::
with
a_thousand
foes
,
and
he
was be%2:42:07::
one
''
.
Or
the
mode
of
love
to
this
fragment
by
a
recent
poet
:
``
Know know%2:31:01::
ye
,
fair
folk
who
dwell dwell%2:42:00::
on
earth
Or
shall
hereafter
come come%2:38:04::
to

,
That
here
,
with
dust
upon

eyes
,
Iraj
,
the
sweet-tongued
singer
,
lies lie%2:35:00::
.
In_this
true
lover
's
tomb
interred inter%2:41:00::
A
world
of
love
lies lie%2:42:03::
sepulchred
''
.
These
songs
(
practically
all
Persian
music
,
for_that_matter
)
are be%2:42:03::
limited
to
a
range
of
two
octaves
.
Yet
within
this
limitation
there
is be%2:42:04::
an
astonishing
variety
:
design
as
intricate
as
that
in
the
carpet
or
miniature
,
with
the
melodic_line
like
the
painted
or
woven
line
often
flowing flow%2:38:01::
into
an
arabesque
.
