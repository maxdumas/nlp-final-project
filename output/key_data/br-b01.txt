Rafael_Trujillo

years

perhaps

freedom

people
of
the
Caribbean
fiefdom
is be%2:42:06::
a
question
that
cannot
now
be
answered answer%2:31:00::
.
Trujillo
knew know%2:31:03::
a
great_deal
about
assassination
.
The
responsibility
for
scores
of
deaths
,
including include%2:42:00::
the
abduction
and
murder
of
Jesus_Maria_Galindez
,
a
professor
at
Columbia_University
in
New_York
,
has
been
laid lay%2:35:01::
at
his
door

He
had
been be%2:42:03::
involved
in
countless
schemes
to
do_away_with
democratic
leaders
in
neighboring
countries
such_as
President_Romulo_Betancourt
of
Venezuela
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
a
sort_of
poetic_justice
that
at_the_time
of
his
own
demise
a
new
plot
to
overthrow overthrow%2:41:00::
the
Venezuelan
government
,
reportedly
involving involve%2:42:00::
the
use

arms
by
former
Venezuelan
Dictator_Marcos_Perez_Jimenez
,
has
been

and
quashed quash%2:41:00::
.
The
recent
history
of
the
Dominican_Republic
is be%2:42:03::
an
almost
classical
study
of
the
way
in_which
even
a
professedly
benevolent
dictatorship
tends tend%2:42:00::
to
become become%2:30:00::
oppressive
.
Unquestionably
Trujillo
did do%2:41:01::
some
good
things
for
his
country
:
he
improved improve%2:30:01::
public
facilities
such_as
roads
and
sanitation
,
attracted attract%2:37:01::
industry
and
investment
and
raised raise%2:30:01::
the
standard_of_living
notably
.
But
the
price
was be%2:42:06::
the
silence
of
the
grave
for
all
criticism
or
opposition
.
El_Benefactor
's
vanity
grew grow%2:30:00::
with
his
personal
wealth
.
The
jails
were be%2:42:03::
filled
to
overflowing_with
political_prisoners
who
had
incurred incur%2:42:00::
his
displeasure
.
He
maintained maintain%2:40:00::
amply
financed
lobbies
in
the
United_States
and
elsewhere
which
sycophantically
chanted chant%2:32:00::
his
praise
,
and
his
influence
extended extend%2:42:03::
even
to
Congress
.
Until
the
last
year
or_so
the
profession
of
friendship
with
the
United_States
had
been be%2:42:03::
an
article
of
faith
with
Trujillo
,
and
altogether
too
often
this
profession
was
accepted accept%2:31:01::
here
as
evidence
of
his
good
character
.
Tardily
the
Government
here
came come%2:30:01::
to
understand understand%2:31:00::
how
this
country
's
own
reputation
was
tarnished tarnish%2:35:00::
by
the
association
with
repression
.
Last
year
,
after
Trujillo
had
been
cited cite%2:32:00::
for
numerous
aggressions
in
the
Caribbean
,
the
United_States
and
many
other
members
of
the
Organization_of_American_States
broke break%2:30:02::
diplomatic
relations
with
him
.
Thereupon
followed follow%2:42:01::
a
demonstration
that
tyranny
knows know%2:31:06::
no
ideological
confines
.
Trujillo
's
dictatorship
had
been be%2:42:03::
along
conservative
,
right-wing
lines
.
But
after
the
censure
he
and
his
propaganda
started start%2:30:00::
mouthing mouth%2:32:00::
Communist
slogans
.
There
was be%2:42:04::
considerable
evidence
of
a
tacit
rapprochement
with
Castro
in
Cuba
,
previously
a
bete_noire
to
Trujillo
-
thus
illustrating illustrate%2:32:00::
the
way
in_which
totalitarianism
of
the
right
and
left
coalesces coalesce%2:30:00::
.
What
comes_after come_after%2:42:00::
Trujillo
is be%2:42:06::
now
the
puzzle
.
The
Dominican
people
have
known know%2:31:04::
no
democratic
institutions
and
precious
little
freedom
for
a
generation
,
and
all
alternative
leadership
has
been
suppressed suppress%2:30:00::
.
Perhaps
the
army
will
be be%2:42:03::
able
to
maintain maintain%2:40:00::
stability
,
but
the
vacuum
of
free
institutions
creates create%2:36:00::
a
great
danger
.
The
Dominican_Republic
could
turn turn%2:30:00::
toward
Communist-type
authoritarianism
as
easily
as
toward
Western
freedom
.
Such
a
twist
would
be be%2:42:03::
a
tragedy
for
the
Dominican
people
,
who
deserve deserve%2:42:00::
to
breathe breathe%2:29:00::
without_fear
.
For
that
reason
any
democratic
