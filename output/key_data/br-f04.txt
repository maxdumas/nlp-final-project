The
Director
,
Walter_E._Clark
,
believes believe%2:31:00::
that
a
school
with
children
living live%2:42:08::
full_time
in
its
care
must
take take%2:30:01::
full
responsibility
for

To
him
this
means mean%2:42:00::
caring care%2:41:11::;2:37:02::
for
the
whole
child
,
providing provide%2:40:00::
basic
nutrition
,
and
a
spiritual
attitude
that
lends lend%2:40:01::
freedom
for
the
development
of
the
mind
.
The
concept
of
good
nutrition
really
began begin%2:42:00::
with
the
garden
.
The
school
has
always
maintained maintain%2:40:00::
a
farm
to
supply supply%2:40:00::
the
needs
of
the
school
.
In
a
climate
hostile
to
agriculture
,
Mr._Clark
has
had have%2:42:05::
to
keep keep%2:42:00::
alert
to
the_most
productive
farm
techniques
.
Where
a
growing_season
may
,
with
luck
,
allow allow%2:40:00::
60
days
without
frost
,
and
where
the
soil
is be%2:42:03::
poor
,
sandy
,
quick-drying
and
subject_to
erosion
,
many
farmers
fail fail%2:41:00::
.
Throughout
the
Adirondack
region
abandoned
farm
homes
and
wild
orchards
bear bear_witness%2:32:00::
ghostly
testimony
that
their
owners
met meet%2:39:00::
defeat
.
Mr._Clark
found find%2:36:00::
that
orthodox
procedures
of
deep
plowing
,
use
of
chemical
fertilizers
and
insecticides
,
plus
the
application
of
conservation
principles
of
rotation
and
contouring
,
did
not
prevent prevent%2:41:01::
sheet
erosion
in
the
potato
fields

soil

``
To

,
Mr._Clark

in

about

``
Louis_Bromfield

By
1952
he
was be%2:42:03::
convinced

He
locked lock%2:35:02::
his

it
still

.
After
reading read%2:31:00::
``

he
stopped stop%2:42:00::

they
learned learn%2:31:00::
in_time
that
they
not_only
could
use use%2:34:01::

him
that
