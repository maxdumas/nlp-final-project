Physiologically

because
what
Dr._Jolliffe
calls call%2:32:02::

Jolliffe

in

the

It

be

Reports report%2:32:00::
Dr._Keys
:
``
A

For

amphetamines
(
Benzedrine

Dexedrine

as
dangerous

Keys
has have%2:40:00::
no

objections

Quaker
Oats

900

,
Dr._Keys

only
an

What

Cholesterol
,
the
cornerstone
of
Dr._Keys
's
theory
,
is be%2:42:06::
a
mysterious
yellowish
,
waxy
substance
,
chemically
a
crystalline
alcohol

Scientists
assume assume%2:31:00::
that
cholesterol
(
from
the
Greek
chole
,
meaning
bile
,
and
sterios
,
meaning
solid
)
is be%2:42:03::
somehow
necessary

it
accounts_for account_for%2:42:01::
about

They
know know%2:31:01::
it

the

They
suspect suspect%2:31:02::
it
plays play%2:41:12::
a

production

they
believe believe%2:31:03::
it
is be%2:42:03::
essential

the
transport

But
they

explain explain%2:32:00::
the
process

its
manufacture

``
quite
apart

When

Keys

mainly
responsible_for
the

culminate culminate%2:30:00::

Explains explain%2:32:00::
Keys
:
As

slowing slow%2:30:00::

Eventually
,
says say%2:32:00::
Keys
,
one
of
two
things
happens happen%2:30:00::
.
A
clot
forms form%2:42:02::
at
the

seals_off seal_off%2:33:00::
the
flow
of
blood
to
the
heart
and
provokes provoke%2:32:00::
a
heart_attack
.
Or
(
more
commonly
,
thinks think%2:31:03::
Keys
)
the
deposits
themselves
get get%2:30:00::
so
big
that
they
choke_off choke_off%2:35:00::
the

and
the

Ordinarily
,
the
human
liver
synthesizes synthesize%2:31:00::
only
enough
cholesterol
to
satisfy satisfy%2:34:01::
the
body
's
needs
-
for
transportation
of
fats
and
for
production

bile
.
Even
eggs
and
other
cholesterol-rich
foods
,
eaten eat%2:34:00::
in
normal
amounts
,
says say%2:32:00::
Dr._Keys
,
do
not
materially
affect affect%2:30:00::
the
amount
of
cholesterol
in
the
blood
.
But
fatty
foods
do
.
During
World_War
2
,
,
doctors
in
The_Netherlands
and
Scandinavia
noted note%2:39:00::
a
curious
fact
:
despite
the
stresses
of
Nazi
occupation
,
the
death_rate
from
coronary_artery
disease
was
slowly
dropping drop%2:30:00::
.
Not
until
long
after
the
war
-
1950
,
in_fact
-
did
they
get get%2:40:00::
a
hint
of
the
reason
.
That
year
,
Sweden
's
Haqvin_Malmros
showed show%2:32:00::
that
the
sinking
death_rate
neatly
coincided coincide%2:30:00::
with
increasingly
severe
restrictions
on
fatty
foods
.
That
same
year
the
University
of
California
's
Dr._Laurance_Kinsell
,
timing time%2:30:00::
oxidation
rates
of
blood
fats
,
stumbled stumble%2:40:10::
onto
the
discovery
that
many
vegetable
fats
cause cause%2:32:00::
blood
cholesterol
levels
to
drop drop%2:30:00::
radically
,
while
animal_fats
cause cause%2:32:00::
them
to
rise rise%2:30:00::
.
Here
Keys
and_others
,
such_as
Dr._A._E._Ahrens
of
the
Rockefeller_Institute
,
took_over take_over%2:40:07::
to
demonstrate demonstrate%2:31:00::
the
chemical
difference
between
vegetable
and
animal_fats
-
and
even
between
different
varieties
of
each
.
All
natural
food
fats
fall_into fall_into%2:42:00::
one
of
three
categories
-
saturated
,
mono-unsaturated
and
poly-unsaturated
.
The
degree
of
saturation
depends_on depend_on%2:42:00::
the
number
of
hydrogen_atoms

Saturated
fats
can
accommodate accommodate%2:42:00::
no_more
hydrogens

Mono-unsaturated
fats
have have%2:40:00::
room
for
two
more
hydrogens
on
each
molecule

and
the
poly-unsaturated
fat
molecule
has have%2:40:00::

at_least
four

The
three
fats
have have%2:40:00::
similar
caloric

about
265
calories

)
,
but
each
