There
was be%2:42:04::
a
time
some
years
ago
when
local
taxation
by
the
cities
and
towns
was be%2:42:03::
sufficient
to
support support%2:40:00::
their
own
operations
and
a
part
of
the
cost
of
the
state_government
as_well
.
For
many
years
a
state
tax
on
cities
and
towns
was
paid pay%2:40:00::
by
the
several
municipalities
to
the
state
from
the
proceeds
of
the
general
property_tax
.
This
tax
was
discontinued discontinue%2:42:00::
in
1936
.
Since
that
time
the
demands
of
the
citizens
for
new
and
expanded
services
have
placed place%2:35:00::
financial
burdens
on
the
state
which
could
not
have
been
foreseen foresee%2:41:00::
in
earlier
years
.
At_the_same_time
there
has
been be%2:42:04::
an
upgrading
and
expansion
of
municipal
services
as_well
.
Thus
,
there
has
come_into_being come_into_being%2:30:01::
a
situation
in_which
the
state
must
raise raise%2:40:00::
all_of
its
own
revenues
and
,
in_addition
,
must
give give%2:40:05::
assistance
to
its
local_governments
.
This
financial
assistance
from
the
state
has
become become%2:30:00::
necessary
because
the
local_governments
themselves
found find%2:31:10::
the
property_tax
,
or
at_least
at
the
rates
then
existing exist%2:42:00::
,
insufficient
for
their
requirements
.
Consequently
there
have
developed develop%2:36:01::
several
forms
of
grants-in-aid
and
shared
taxes
,
as_well
as
the
unrestricted
grant
to
local_governments
for
general
purposes
whose
adoption
accompanied accompany%2:42:00::
the
introduction
of
a
sales_tax
at
the
state
level
.
Notwithstanding
state
aid
,
the
local_governments
are
continuing continue%2:42:01::
to
seek seek%2:40:00::
additional
revenue
of
their
own
by
strengthening strengthen%2:30:01::
the

This
is
being
done do%2:41:01::
both
by
the
revaluation

by

Taxation
of
tangible
movable
property
in
Rhode_Island
has
been be%2:42:03::
generally
of
a
``
hands
off
''
nature
due
possibly
to
several
reasons
:
(
1
)
local
assessors
,
in_the_main
,
are be%2:42:03::
not
well
paid pay%2:40:00::
and
have have%2:42:00::
inadequate
office_staffs
,
(
2
)
the
numerous
categories
of_this
component
of
personal_property
make make%2:30:00::
locating
extremely
difficult
,
and
(
3
)
the
inexperience
of
the
majority
of
assessors
in
evaluating evaluate%2:31:00::
this
type
of
property
.
Among
the
many
problems
in
the
taxing
of
personal_property
,
and
of
movable
tangible
property
in_particular
,
two
are be%2:42:03::
significant
:
(
1
)
situs
,
(
2
)
fair
and
equitable
assessment
of
value
.
These
problems
are be%2:42:03::
not
local
to
Rhode_Island
,
but
are
recognized recognize%2:31:02::
as
common
to
all
states
.
Although
the
laws
of
the
various
states
,
in_general
,
specify specify%2:32:03::
the
situs
of
property
,
i.
e.
,
residence
or
domicile
of
the
owner

or
location
of
the
property
,
the
exceptions
regarding regard%2:42:00::
boats
,
airplanes
,
mobile_homes
,
etc.
,
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
add add%2:30:00::
to
the
uncertainty
of
the
proper
origination
point
for
assessment
.
Rhode_Island
law
specifies specify%2:32:03::
that
all
real_estate
is be%2:42:03::
taxable
in
the
town
in_which
it
is be%2:42:03::
situated
.
It
also
provides provide%2:32:00::
for
the
taxation
of
all
personal_property
,
belonging belong%2:40:00::
to
inhabitants
of
the
state
,
both
tangible
and
intangible
,
and
the
tangible
personal_property
of
non-residents
in_this
state
.
In
defining define%2:32:00::
personal_property
,
it
specifically
mentions mention%2:32:02::
``
all
ships
or
vessels
,
at_home
or
abroad
''
.
Intangible
property
is be%2:42:03::
taxable
wherever
the
owner
has have%2:40:00::
a
place
of
abode
the
greater
portion
of
the
year
.
Although
a
similar
situs
for
tangible
property
is
mentioned mention%2:32:02::
in
the
statute
,
this
is
cancelled_out cancel_out%2:30:00::
by
the
provision
that
definite
kinds
of
property
``
and
all
other
tangible
property
''
situated
or
being be%2:42:05::
in
any
town
is be%2:42:03::
taxable
where
the
property
is be%2:42:03::
situated
.
This
would
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
fix fix%2:32:03::
the
tax
situs
of
all
movable
personal_property
at
its
location
on
December
31
.
Both
boats
and
aircraft
would
fall fall%2:42:03::
within
this
category
,
as_well
as
motor_vehicles
.
The
location
of
the
latter
now
is
determined determine%2:32:03::
for
tax
purposes
at_the_time
of
registration
,
and
it
is
now
accepted
practice
to
consider consider%2:31:00::
a
motor_vehicle
as
being be%2:42:03::
situated
where
it
is
garaged garage%2:40:00::
.
Obviously
,
it
would
be be%2:42:03::
impossible
to
determine determine%2:32:00::
where
every
vehicle
might
be be%2:42:05::
on
the
31
st
day
of
December
.
In_view
of
the
acceptance
accorded accord%2:40:00::
the
status
of
motor_vehicles
for
tax
purposes
,
in
the
absence
of
any
specific
provision
it
would
seem seem%2:39:00::
entirely
consistent
to
apply apply%2:34:00::
the
same
interpretation
to
boats
or
aircraft
.
A
recent
example
of_this
problem
is be%2:42:06::
the
flying
of
six
airplanes
,
on
December
31
,
1960
,
from
the
Newport_Airpark
in
Middletown
,
to_the_North
Central_Airport
in
Smithfield
.
This
situation
resulted result%2:42:02::
in
both
towns
claiming claim%2:32:02::
the
tax
,
and
probably
justifiably
.
Middletown
bases base%2:31:00::
its
claim
on
the
general
provision
of
the
law
that
``
all
rateable
property
,
both
tangible
and
intangible
,
shall
be
taxed tax%2:40:00::

the
owner

town
in_which
such
owner
shall
have
had have%2:40:04::
his
actual
place
of
abode
for
the
larger
portion
of
the
twelve
(
12
)
months
next
preceding precede%2:42:00::
the
first
day
of
April
in
each_year
''
.
The
Smithfield
tax_assessor
,
in_turn
,
claims claim%2:32:02::
the
tax
under
the
provision
of
law
``
and
all

be
taxed tax%2:40:00::
to
such
person
in
the
town
where
said
property
is be%2:42:03::
situated
''
.
This
problem
of
fair
and
equitable
assessment
of
value
is be%2:42:03::
a
difficult
one
to
solve solve%2:31:00::
in_that
the
determination
of
fair
valuation
is be%2:42:03::
dependent_on
local
assessors

who
in_general
are be%2:42:03::
non-professional
and
part-time
personnel
taking take%2:31:01::
an
individualistic
approach
to
the
problem
.
This
accounts_for account_for%2:42:00::
the
wide
variance
in
assessment
practices
of
movable
tangible
property
in
the
various
municipalities
in
Rhode_Island
.
This
condition
will
undoubtedly
continue continue%2:42:01::
until
such
time
as
a
state
uniform
system
of
evaluation
is
established establish%2:41:00::
,
or
through
mutual
agreement
of
the
local
assessing
officials

be
adopted adopt%2:40:02::
.
The
Rhode_Island
Public_Expenditure_Council
in
its
publication
once
commented comment%2:32:00::
:
``
The_most
realistic
way

.
The
Institute
of
Public_Administration
,
in
its
report
to
the
State_Fiscal_Study_Commission
in
1959
,
recommended recommend%2:32:01::

.
The

was
declared declare%2:32:00::

.
To
determine determine%2:32:00::
the
practice
and
attitude
of
municipal_governments
concerning
tangible

property
,
a
questionnaire
was
sent send%2:32:00::
to
all

boards
of
assessors
in
Rhode_Island
.
The
replies
from
each
individual
town
are
not
given give%2:40:07::
in
detail
because
the
questions
asked ask%2:32:00::
the
personal
opinion
of
the
several
assessors
and
are be%2:42:06::
not
necessarily
the
established
policy
of
the
town
in
each
case
.
There
are
legitimate
reasons
for
differences_of_opinion
among
the
assessors
as_a_whole
and
among
the
public
officials
in
each
town
.
These
opinions
of
the
assessors
are be%2:42:03::
of
significance
in
indicating indicate%2:32:00::
what
their
thinking
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
at_the_present_time
.
In_reply
to
a
question
of
whether
they
now
tax tax%2:40:00::
boats
,
airplanes
and
other
movable
property
excluding exclude%2:31:01::
automobiles
,
nineteen
said say%2:32:00::
that
they
did
and
twenty
that
they
did
not
.
The
wording
of
the
question
was be%2:42:03::
quite
general
and
may
have
been be%2:42:03::
subject
to
different
interpretations
.
One
assessor
checked check%2:31:00::
boats
only
,
another
trailers
and
tractors
,
one
mentioned mention%2:32:02::
house_trailers
,
and
two
others
referred refer%2:32:01::
to
trailers
without
specifying specify%2:32:00::
the
type
.
In
two
cases
,
airplanes
only
were
indicated indicate%2:32:03::
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
difficult
to
tabulate tabulate%2:36:00::
exactly
what
was
meant mean%2:32:01::
in
each
individual
situation
,
but
the
conclusion
may
be
drawn
that
21
towns
do
not
assess assess%2:31:00::
movable
personal_property
,
and
of
the
remainder
only
certain
types
are
valued value%2:31:03::
for
tax
purposes
.
Boats
were
indicated indicate%2:32:03::
specifically
by
only
one
of
the
five
towns
known
to
tax tax%2:40:00::
boats
.
It
would
seem seem%2:39:01::
,
then
,
that
movable
property
and
equipment
is
not
taxed tax%2:40:00::
as_a_whole
but
that
certain
types
are
taxed tax%2:40:00::
in
towns
where
this
is be%2:42:03::
bound_to
be
expedient
for
that
particular
kind_of
personal_property
.
So
few
answered answer%2:32:00::
the
question
relating relate%2:42:00::
to
their
efforts
to
assess assess%2:31:00::
movable
property
that
the
results
are be%2:42:03::
inconclusive
.
Only
four
towns
indicated indicate%2:32:00::
that
they
made make%2:41:00::
any_more
than
a
normal
effort
to
list list%2:32:00::
property
of_this
kind
.
Of
greater
interest
is be%2:42:06::
a
question
as
to
whether
movable
property
was
assessed assess%2:31:00::
according
to
its
location
or
ownership
.
Fifteen
stated state%2:32:00::
that
it
was be%2:42:03::
according
to
location
,
four
by
residence
of
the
owner
,
and
nineteen
did
not
answer answer%2:32:00::
.
Twenty-seven
assessors
stated state%2:32:00::
that
they
were be%2:42:03::
in
favor
of
improved
means
for
assessing assess%2:31:00::
movable
personal_property
,
and
only
five
were be%2:42:03::
opposed
.
Seven
others
expressed express%2:32:00::
no
opinion
.
On
this
point
there
was be%2:42:04::
fairly
general_agreement
that
assessors
would
like like%2:37:01::
to
do do%2:41:01::
more_than
they
are
doing do%2:41:01::
now
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
not
clear
,
however
,
whether
they
are
thinking_of think_of%2:31:02::
all
movable
property
or
only
of
boats
,
trailers
,
aircraft
or
certain
other
types
of
personal_property
whose
assessment
would
be be%2:42:03::
advantageous
to
their
particular
towns
.
Another
question
that
was
asked ask%2:32:00::
of
the
assessors
was be%2:42:06::
whether
they
favored favor%2:31:00::
the
assessment
of
movable
property
at
its
location
or
at
the
residence
of
the
owner
.
Eighteen
voted vote%2:41:13::
for
assessment
by
the
town
in_which
it
is be%2:42:03::
located
and
eleven
preferred prefer%2:31:00::
assessment
by
the
town
in_which
the
owner
resides reside%2:42:00::
.
Ten
others
made make%2:41:00::
no
reply
.
Of
those
who
have have%2:40:00::
an
opinion
,
it
seems seem%2:39:01::
that
assessment
by
location
is
preferred prefer%2:31:00::
.
There
was be%2:42:04::
one
vote
for
location
being be%2:42:06::
the
place
where
the
property
is be%2:42:03::
situated
for
the
greater
portion
of
the
twelve
months
preceding
the
assessment
date
.
To
summarize summarize%2:32:00::
,
it
may
be
said say%2:32:00::
that
there
is be%2:42:00::
no
one
prevailing
practice
in
Rhode_Island
with_respect_to
the
taxation
of
movable
property
,
that
assessors
would
like like%2:37:01::
to
see see%2:39:02::
an
improvement
,
and
of
those
who
have have%2:40:00::
an
opinion
,
that
assessment
by
the
town
of
location
is
preferred prefer%2:31:00::
on
the
basis
of
their
present
knowledge
.
The
need
for
greater
knowledge
is be%2:42:03::
evident
from
their
replies
.
Interest
has
been
shown show%2:32:02::
for
a_number_of
years
by
local
assessors
in
the
possibility
of
taxing tax%2:40:00::
boats
.
Assessors
in
Rhode_Island
are
charged charge%2:41:00::
not_only
with
placing place%2:31:01::
a
valuation
upon
real
and
personal_property
,
but
they
also
have have%2:40:00::
the
responsibility
to
raise raise%2:40:00::
by
a
tax
``
a
sum
not
less_than
nor
more_than
''
a
specified
amount
as
ordered order%2:32:02::
by
a
city_council
or
financial
town_meeting
.
It
has
been be%2:42:03::
obvious
to
the
assessors
,
particularly
those
in
shore
communities
,
that
boats
comprise comprise%2:42:01::
the
largest
category
of
tangible
personal_property
which
they
have
been be%2:42:03::
unable
to
reach reach%2:38:01::
.
Through
their
professional
organization
,
the
Rhode_Island
Tax
Officials
Association
the
question
of
taxing tax%2:40:00::
boats
long
has
been
debated debate%2:32:00::
and
discussed discuss%2:32:00::
.
No
satisfactory
solution
has
been
found find%2:39:02::
,
but
this
is_due be_due%2:42:00::
more
to
the
difficulties
inherent
in
the
problem
than
to
a
lack
of
interest
or
diligence
on
the
part
of
the
assessors
.
It
has
been
estimated estimate%2:31:00::
that
the
value
of
boats
in
Rhode_Island
waters
is be%2:42:07::
something
in_excess
of
fifty
million
dollars
,
excluding exclude%2:31:01::
commercial
boats
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
obvious
that
this
is be%2:42:06::
a
potential
and
lucrative
source
of
revenue
for
the
assessors
of
those
towns
where
a
substantial
amount
of
such
property
would
be be%2:42:03::
subject
to
taxation
.
It
is
known know%2:31:01::
that
at_least
five
towns
(
Barrington
,
Bristol
,
Narragansett
,
Newport
and
Westerly
)
place place%2:31:01::
some
value
on
some
boats
for
tax
purposes
.
However
,
few
are
taxed tax%2:40:00::
