during
one
of
the
Maestro
's
stop-overs
in

before

As
we
began begin%2:30:00::
to

in
the
lounge
of

his

Steinberg
began begin%2:30:00::

and
the
initial
hurried
feeling
grew grow%2:30:03::
faint
and
was
dispelled dispel%2:38:00::
.
Did
he
come come%2:42:04::
from
a

family
?
Yes
:
though
not
professional
musicians
,
they
were be%2:42:06::
a
music-loving
family

In

whereby
the

When

,
he
could
not

begins begin%2:42:00::
with

instead

,
but
this
escapade
did
not

Simultaneously

,
receiving receive%2:39:03::
sound
training
in

His

,
and
a
year
later
was

.
Was
n't
this
an
unusually
young
age
to
fill fill%2:41:00::
such
a
responsible
post
?
Yes
,
the
Maestro
assented assent%2:32:00::
.
Had
he
always
wished wish%2:37:00::
to
be be%2:41:00::

No
,
originally
he
had

to
become become%2:42:01::

However
,
when

assumed assume%2:41:00::
the
duties
of
a
conductor
,
he
relinquished relinquish%2:40:01::
his
career
as
a
pianist
.
Five
years
were
spent spend%2:42:00::
with
the
Cologne_Opera
,
after
which
he
was
called call%2:32:05::
to

lost lose%2:40:02::
this
position
in
1933
through
the
rise
of
the
Hitler

.
During
these
years
the
youthful
conductor
had
contributed contribute%2:40:01::
greatly
to
the
high
level
of
musical
life
in
Germany
.
He
had
presented present%2:36:00::
the
first
German
performances
of
Puccini

The
Frankfurt
years
were be%2:42:03::
particularly
noteworthy
for
his
performance
of
Berg

after
the
Berlin
premiere
under
Erich_Kleiber
,
and
the
world
premiere
of
Scho

nberg
's

At
the
outset
of
his
career
,
Steinberg
had
dedicated dedicate%2:32:00::
himself
to
the
advancement
of
contemporary
music
by
vowing vow%2:32:00::

the
standard
repertoire
,
featured feature%2:42:00::
novelties
like
Erdmann
's
Piano_Concerto
and
Mahler
's
Sixth_Symphony
.
Because
of
the
political
upheaval
in
Germany
in
the
1930
's
,
Steinberg
was
forced force%2:41:00::
to
restrict restrict%2:41:00::

Through

Since
he
introduces introduce%2:36:00::
so_much

I
could
not
resist resist%2:33:00::
asking ask%2:32:00::
how
he
felt feel%2:31:00::
about
it

``
There

.
With
all
his
musical
activities
,
did
he
have have%2:40:01::
the
time
and
inclination
to
do do%2:41:04::
anything

?
He
had
just
paid pay%2:31:00::
a
brief
visit
to
the
Frick_Collection
to
admire admire%2:39:00::
his
favorite
paintings
by
Rembrandt
and
Franz_Hals

He
was be%2:42:03::
not
enthusiastic
over
the
newly
acquired
Claude_Lorrain
,
but
reminisced reminisce%2:31:00::
with
pleasure
over

And_how
did
he
feel feel%2:31:00::
about

Again
Steinberg
was be%2:42:03::
cautious
and
replied reply%2:32:00::
with
a
smile
that
he
was
not
exposed expose%2:39:02::
to_it
enough
to
hazard hazard%2:32:00::
comments

``
As

!
What
did
he
do do%2:36:01::
for
relaxation

Like
his

he
reads read%2:31:00::

in_particular
Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle

He
cited cite%2:32:00::

But
his
prime
interest

apart

he
insisted insist%2:32:00::
seriously

was be%2:42:06::
his
