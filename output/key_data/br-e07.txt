The
design
of
a
mechanical
interlocking
frame
is be%2:42:03::
much
like
a
mechanical
puzzle
,
but
once
understood understand%2:31:00::
,
the
principles
can
be
applied apply%2:34:00::
to
any
track
and
signal
arrangement
.
In
the
frame
are be%2:42:05::
two
sets
of
bars
which
interact interact%2:41:00::
with
each
other
to
prevent prevent%2:41:00::
the
operator
from
making
dangerous
moves
.
The
main
set
of
bars
are be%2:42:06::
the
``
tappets
''
and
one
tappet
is
connected
to
each
lever
.
If
the
lever
is
pulled pull%2:35:00::
to
clear clear%2:30:09::
a
signal
or
move move%2:38:01::
a
switch
,
the
tappet
moves move%2:38:00::
a
short
distance
lengthwise
at_the_same_time
.
Close
behind
the
plane
of
the
tappets
are be%2:42:05::
the
locking
bars
.
These
can
also
move move%2:38:00::
a
short
distance
but
at
right_angles
to
the
tappets
.
The
number
of
locking
bars
required require%2:42:00::
depends_on depend_on%2:42:00::
how
many
false
moves
must
be
prevented prevent%2:41:01::
.
In
the
sides
of
the
tappets
are be%2:42:05::
notches
with
sloping
sides
,
and
connection
between
the
tappets
and
locking
bars
consist_of consist_of%2:42:00::
cams
called call%2:32:02::
``
dogs
''
.
Two
or
more
dogs
are
mounted mount%2:35:00::
on
each
locking
bar
.
These
slide slide%2:38:01::
into
and
out
of
the
notches
in
the
tappets
as
the
tappets
are
moved move%2:38:01::
,
locking lock%2:35:01::
and
unlocking unlock%2:35:01::
them
.
Here
's
how
the
scheme
works work%2:35:02::
:
Suppose suppose%2:32:00::
the
operator
pulls pull%2:35:00::
the
lever
to
clear clear%2:30:09::
a
particular
signal
.
This
also
pulls pull%2:35:00::
the
tappet
connected
to
the
particular
lever
and
forces force%2:38:00::
any
dogs
seated
in
the
notches
to_the_side
,
thus
moving move%2:38:01::
one
or
more
locking
bars
.
The
dogs
on
the
other
ends
of
these
locking
bars
are
thus
forced force%2:38:00::
into
notches
in
other
tappets
.
By
this
scheme
,
pulling pull%2:35:00::
one
signal
to
clear
locks lock%2:35:01::
all
the
other
switch
and
signal
levers
in
safe
positions
until
the
first
signal
is
again
restored restore%2:41:01::
to
normal
.
Interlocking
signals
are be%2:42:05::
normally
at
stop
or
``
red
''
position
,
and
a
lever
must
be
pulled pull%2:35:00::
to
``
clear clear%2:30:09::
''
the
signal
.
This
is be%2:42:05::
not
necessarily
to
green
,
however
,
for
in
some
situations
only
a
yellow
indication
is
given give%2:40:07::
to
a
train
to
let let%2:41:00::
it
into
the
``
plant
''
.
There
are be%2:42:00::
other
basic
rules
.
A
turnout
may
have have%2:40:00::
two
levers
,
one
to
actually
move move%2:38:01::
the
switch
points
,
the
other
to
lock lock%2:35:01::
the
points
.
A
signal
cannot
be
cleared clear%2:30:09::
until
all
the
related
turnouts
are
properly
thrown throw%2:35:01::
and
locked lock%2:35:01::
.
Such
locks
are
nearly
always
used use%2:34:01::
where
the
switch
points
``
face face%2:42:00::
''
oncoming
traffic
.
The
lock
insures insure%2:32:04::
that
the
points
are
thrown throw%2:35:01::
all_the_way
with
no
chance
that
a
wheel
flange
will
snag snag%2:35:00::
on
a
partly
thrown throw%2:35:01::
point
.
If
the
points
are
n't
thrown throw%2:35:01::
all_the_way
,
the
turnout
cannot
be
locked lock%2:35:01::
,
and
in_turn
,
the
signal
cannot
be
cleared clear%2:30:09::
.
Generally
,
these
locks
on
turnouts
are_called
``
facing
point
locks
''
.

By
studying study%2:39:00::
the

you
'll
note note%2:39:00::
several
other
details
.
Derails
-
mechanical
track
devices
that
actually
guide guide%2:38:00::
the
wheels
off
the
rails
if
a
train
passes pass%2:38:05::
a
``
stop
''
signal
-
are
used use%2:34:01::
in
many
instances
.
``
Home
''
signals
have have%2:40:00::
two
blades
.
The
blacked-in
blades
indicate indicate%2:32:01::
a
fixed
aspect
-
the
blade
does
not
move move%2:38:00::
.
As
an
engineer
approaches approach%2:38:00::
the
plant
the
position
of
the
home
signal
is
seen see%2:39:00::
in_advance
when
he
passes pass%2:38:05::
the
``
distant
''
signal
located
beyond
the
limits
of
the
interlocking
plant
.
In
some
low-speed
situations
,
the
distant
signal
is_fixed
at
caution
.
In
other
instances
where
there
is be%2:42:04::
no
automatic
block
signaling
,
the
distant
has have%2:40:00::
only
green
and
yellow
aspects
