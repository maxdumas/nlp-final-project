Wildcat

were be%2:41:00::
originals

but
pretty

,
leaving leave%2:42:01::
top
honors
again
to
an
import
-
the
jaunty

charmingly
French
Irma_La_Douce

The

Originals
are be%2:42:03::

adaptations
are be%2:42:03::

Some

plays
have
been
drawn draw%2:31:13::
from
books

Life

And

And
other
defenders
invariably
argue argue%2:32:00::
that
,
after_all
,
Shakespeare
and
Moliere
were be%2:42:06::
adapters
too
.
The
difference
is be%2:42:06::
that
the
masters
took take%2:40:15::
the

The_most
frequent
excuse
for
the
prevalence
of
unoriginals
and
tested
imports
is be%2:42:06::
increasing
production
expense
-

cannot
afford afford%2:34:00::

But
that
explanation

only

Off-Broadway
,
where
production
is be%2:42:03::
still
comparatively
cheap

only
slightly
more
original

Laudably
enough
,
it
is
offering offer%2:40:02::

off-beat

,
but
last

only

The
real
trouble
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
the

Several
more

Their
burgeoning
popularity
may
be be%2:42:06::
a
result
of
the

to

paintings
on
the

with
his
own
spittle
.
For
years
he
wore wear%2:29:00::
hand-me-down
suits
and
homemade
paper
collars
,
was
even
driven drive%2:36:00::
to
scrounging scrounge%2:40:00::

his

The
unabashed

of
so
many_of
this
paintings
was be%2:42:03::
not
the
only
thing
that
kept keep%2:42:00::
the
public
at_bay
:
his
view
of
the
world
was be%2:42:06::
one
of
almost
unrelieved
tragedy
,
and
it
was be%2:42:03::
too_much
even
for
morbid-minded
Vienna
.
He
was
obsessed obsess%2:37:00::
by
disease
and
poverty
,
by
the
melancholy
of
old_age
and
the
tyranny
of
lust
.
The
children
he
painted paint%2:36:00::
were be%2:42:03::
almost
always
in
rags
,
his
portraits
were be%2:42:03::
often
ruthless
to_the_point
of
ugliness
,
and
his
nudes
-
including include%2:42:00::
several
self-portraits
-
were be%2:42:03::
stringy
,
contorted
and
strangely
pathetic
.
The
subject
he
liked like%2:37:04::
most
was be%2:42:06::
the
female_body
,
which
he
painted paint%2:36:00::
in
every
state
-
naked
,
half-dressed
,
muffled
to
the
ears
,
sitting sit%2:35:00::
primly
in
a
chair
,
lying lie%2:35:00::
tauntingly
on
a
bed
or
locked lock%2:35:03::
in
an
embrace
.
