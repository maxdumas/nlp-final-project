I
would
like like%2:37:01::
to
add add%2:30:00::
one
more
practical
reform
to
those
mentioned mention%2:32:02::
by
Russell_Kirk
[
Dec.

]
.
It
has have%2:42:12::
to
do do%2:42:00::
with
teachers
'
salaries
and
tenure
.
Next
September
,
after
receiving receive%2:40:00::
a
degree
from
Yale
's
Master_of_Arts_in_Teaching
Program
,
I
will
be
teaching teach%2:32:00::
somewhere
-
that_much
is be%2:42:03::
guaranteed
by
the
present
shortage
of
mathematics_teachers
.
I
will
also
be be%2:42:03::
underpaid
.
The
amazing
thing
is be%2:42:06::
that
this
too
is
caused cause%2:36:00::
by
the
dearth
of
teachers
.
Teaching
is be%2:42:03::
at_present
a
sellers
'
market
;
as
a
result
buyers
,
the
public
,
must
be
satisfied satisfy%2:37:00::
with
second-rate
teachers
.
But
this
is be%2:42:03::
not
the
real
problem
;
the
rub
arises arise%2:42:00::
from
the
fact
that
teachers
are
usually
paid pay%2:40:00::
on
the
basis
of
time
served serve%2:41:00::
rather_than
quality
.
Hence
all
teachers
,
good
and
bad
,
who
have
been
teaching teach%2:32:00::
for
a
given
number
of
years
are
paid pay%2:40:00::
the
same
salary
.
I
am be%2:42:03::
firmly
convinced
that
considering consider%2:39:00::
the
average
quality
of
teachers
in_this
country
,
the
profession
is be%2:42:03::
grossly
overpaid
.
It
follows follow%2:42:05::
that
teachers
as_a_group
cannot
expect expect%2:31:00::
any
marked
salary
increases
;
there
is
a
limit
to
how
much
the
public
will
pay pay%2:40:00::
for
shoddy
performance
.
The
only
hope
which
good
teachers
have have%2:40:00::
for
being
paid pay%2:40:01::
their
due
is be%2:42:03::
to
stop stop%2:42:00::
dragging drag%2:35:00::
the
dead
weight
of
poor
teachers
up
the
economic
ladder
with
them
.
The
only
hope
which
the
public
has have%2:40:00::
for
getting get%2:40:00::
good
teachers
is be%2:42:06::
to
pay pay%2:40:00::
teachers
on
the
basis
of
merit
rather_than
tenure
.
Here
,
as
in_all
sectors
of
the
economy
,
quality
and
justice
are be%2:42:03::
both
dependent_on
the
right
of
the
individual
to
deal deal%2:40:00::
directly
with
his
employer
if
he
so
chooses choose%2:31:02::
.
On
the
eve
of
the
``
great
debate
''
on
the
proposal
to
give give%2:40:05::
the
President
broad
powers
to
make make%2:41:00::
across-the-board
tariff
concessions
which
could
practically
bring bring%2:36:00::
us
into
the
Atlantic_Community
,
we
should
face face%2:32:00::
the
alternatives
on
this
proposition
.
What
we
will
be
sacrificing sacrifice%2:40:00::
in
any
such
arrangement
will
be be%2:42:06::
our
power
to
be be%2:42:03::
selective
which
is
contained contain%2:42:00::
in
the
reciprocal
trade
principle
under
which
we
now
operate operate%2:35:03::
.
Without
this
power
we
lay lay%2:35:01::
open
any
American
industry
which
the
Europeans
may
find find%2:36:00::
it
economically
profitable
to
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
to
the
will
of
others
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
this
loss
of
initiative
in
how
we
conduct conduct%2:36:00::
our
economy
which
may
lead lead%2:42:12::
to
the
loss
of
initiative
in
how
we
conduct conduct%2:36:00::
our
political
affairs
.
I
disagree disagree%2:32:00::
with
Mr._Burnham
's
position
on
the
Common_Market
[
Nov.
18
]
as
a
desirable
organization
for
us
to
join join%2:41:00::
.
For
him
to
ignore ignore%2:32:00::
the
political
consequences
involved involve%2:42:01::
in
an
Atlantic_Union
of_this
kind
is be%2:42:03::
difficult
to
understand understand%2:31:00::
.
The
pressure
for
our
entry
to
the
Common_Market
is
mounting mount%2:30:00::
and
we
will
proceed proceed%2:38:00::
towards
this
amalgamated
trade_union
by
way
of
a
purely
``
economic
thoroughfare
''
,
or
garden
path
,
with
the
political
ramifications
kept keep%2:42:00::
neatly
in
the
background
.
The
appeal
is
going_to
be be%2:42:03::
to
the
pocketbook
and
may
be be%2:42:03::
very
convincing
to
those
who
do
not
see see%2:31:01::
its
relation_to
political
and
legal
,
as_well
as
economic
,
self-rule
.
In
entering enter%2:42:00::
this
union
we
will
be
surrendering surrender%2:33:01::
most
,
if_not
all
,
of
our
economic
autonomy
to
international
bodies
such_as
the
Atlantic_Institute
(
recently
set_up set_up%2:36:01::
)
or
the
O._E._C._D.
,
I._M._F.
and_others
.
To
think think%2:31:03::
that
we
can
merely
relinquish relinquish%2:40:01::
our
economic
autonomy
without
giving_up give_up%2:40:02::
our
political
or
legal
autonomy
is be%2:42:03::
wishful_thinking
.
If
it
is be%2:42:03::
not
enough
that
all_of
our
internationalist
One
Worlders
are
advocating advocate%2:32:00::
that
we
join join%2:41:00::
this
market
,
I
refer refer%2:38:00::
you
to
an
article
in
the
New_York
Times
'
magazine
section
[
Nov.

1961

,
by
Mr._Eric_Johnston
,
entitled
``
We
Must
Join join%2:41:00::

Common_Market

He
says say%2:32:00::
:
``
It
has
swept sweep%2:38:01::
aside
petty
nationalisms
,
age-old
rivalries

Referring refer%2:32:01::
to
Britain
,
he
says say%2:32:00::
,
``
We

.
Since
the
goal
of
our
international
planners
is be%2:42:06::
a
World_Government
,
this
Atlantic_Community
would
mark mark%2:35:09::
a
giant
step
in
that
direction
for
,
once
American
economic
autonomy
is
absorbed absorb%2:31:00::
,
a
larger
grouping
is be%2:42:03::
a
question
of
time
.
Frankly
,
it
is
being
very
cleverly
done do%2:36:01::
for
,
in_a_sense
,
they
have have%2:40:00::
us
over
a
barrel
.
Listen listen%2:39:00::
to
what
Mr._Johnston
has have%2:40:00::
to
say say%2:32:00::
:
``
Consider consider%2:31:00::
the
savage
wounds
that

our

We

crippled cripple%2:30:00::

But
the
solution
to
this

is be%2:42:06::
not
the
incorporation
of
the
United_States

merely
what
libertarians
like
Henry_Hazlitt

have
been

an

If

this
is be%2:42:06::
the
way

it

Today

seven
years
after

date
of

I
am be%2:42:06::
Assistant_Professor

For

after

spent spend%2:42:00::
five

in

The
possibility
of
recall
into

Army

part

the
price

to

for

heritage
of
liberty
which
he
enjoys enjoy%2:37:00::
.
With
this
no
loyal
citizen
can
quarrel quarrel%2:32:00::

However
,
it
seems seem%2:39:00::
axiomatic
that

In

Truly
,
that

choose choose%2:31:00::

as
a
bogey-symbol

is be%2:42:03::
grotesquely
ironic
,
considering consider%2:39:00::
the

character

not_only
in
