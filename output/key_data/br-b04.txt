His

Mr._Hammarskjold
was be%2:42:03::
in
Africa
on
a
mission

peace
.
He
had
sought seek%2:40:00::
talks
with
Moise_Tshombe
,
the
secessionist
president
of
Congo

Katanga
province
where

had
been be%2:42:03::
bloody

He
earnestly
urged urge%2:32:00::
a

The
story
of
the
fatal
crash
is
not

had
been
riddled riddle%2:35:00::
with

was

Whether

.
The
death
of
Mr._Hammarskjold
removes remove%2:41:00::
the
United_Nations
'
most
controversial
leader
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
controversial
because
he
was be%2:42:03::
uncompromising
for
peace
and
freedom
with
justice
.
He
courageously
defended defend%2:33:00::
the
rights
of
small
nations
,
and
he
stood
his
ground
against
the
savage
attacks
of
the
Communist
bloc
.
The
Congo
,
in
whose
cause
he
died die%2:30:00::
,
was be%2:42:05::
the
scene
of
one
of
his
greatest
triumphs
.
His
policies
had
resolved resolve%2:32:00::
the
conflicts
that
threatened threaten%2:32:01::
to

the

workable
solutions
were

When
the
recent
Katangan
outbreaks
imperiled imperil%2:42:00::
these
solutions
Mr._Hammarskjold
,
despite
the
danger
,
flew fly%2:38:00::
to
exert exert%2:34:00::
a
calming
influence
.
He
gave give%2:40:10::
his
life
for
his
beliefs
.
The
U._N.
session
scheduled schedule%2:31:00::
for
today
will
meet meet%2:41:00::
under
the
cloud
of
his
passing
.
It
is be%2:42:07::
a
crucial
session
with
the
world
on
the
edge
of
momentous
developments
.
If
the
manner
of
his
passing
moves move%2:37:00::
the
nations
to
act act%2:41:00::
in
the
spirit
of
his
dedication
the
sore
issues
that
plague plague%2:43:00::
the
world
can
yet
be
resolved resolve%2:32:00::
with_reason
and
justice
.
That
is be%2:42:07::
the
hope
of
mankind
.
Reaching reach%2:41:00::
agreement
on
projects
of
value
to
the
whole
community
has
long
been be%2:42:03::
one
of
Greater_Miami
's
hardest
tasks
.
Too
many
have
bogged_down bog_down%2:30:01::
in
bickering

Even
when
public
bodies
arrived arrive%2:38:00::
at
a
consensus
,
at_least
one
dissenting
vote
has
been be%2:42:03::
usual
.
So
we
note note%2:39:00::
approvingly
a
fresh
sample
of
unanimity
.
All
nine
members
of
the
Inter-American_Center_Authority
voted vote%2:41:13::
for
Goodbody
+
Company
's
proposal
to
finance finance%2:40:00::
the
long-awaited
trade

The

has have%2:40:01::
60
days

the
terms

If

the

to

Then
Goodbody

the

The
next
step
awaits await%2:31:00::
approval
today
by
the
Metro
commissioners
as
the
members
of
the
Dade_County_Port_Authority

They
allotted allot%2:40:02::

of
painstaking

The
balance
is
being
budgeted budget%2:31:00::
for
the
coming
year

Unanimity
on
Interama
is be%2:42:03::
not
surprising

It
is be%2:42:06::
one
of
the
rare
public
ventures

The

This
is be%2:42:07::
the
key
fact
emerging emerge%2:30:00::
from
Sunday
's
national
election
.
Chancellor_Adenauer
's
Christian
Democratic_Party
slipped slip%2:30:00::
only
a_little
in

voting

it
was be%2:42:03::
enough

since

In_order_to
form form%2:42:00::

government
it
must
deal deal%2:41:04::
with

of
the
two
rival
parties
which
gained gain%2:30:01::
strength
.
Inevitably
this
means mean%2:42:00::
some
compromise
.
The
aging
chancellor
in_all
likelihood
will
be
retired retire%2:41:03::
.
Both
Willy_Brandt
's
Social
Democrats
,
who
gained gain%2:40:00::
22
seats
in
the
new
parliament
,
and
the
Free
Democrats
,
who
picked_up pick_up%2:40:02::

,
will
insist insist%2:32:00::
on_that
before
they
enter enter%2:41:06::
the
government
.
Moon-faced
Ludwig_Erhart
,
the
economic_expert
,
probably
will
ascend ascend%2:38:02::
to
the
leadership
long
denied deny%2:40:00::
him
.
If
he
becomes become%2:42:01::
chancellor
,
Dr._Erhart
would
make make%2:41:00::
few
changes
.
The
wizard
who
fashioned fashion%2:36:00::
West_Germany
's
astonishing
industrial
rebirth
is be%2:42:06::
the
soul
of
free_enterprise
.
He
is be%2:42:03::
dedicated_to
building build%2:30:02::
the

strength

,
as
are be%2:42:03::
all
West
Germans

to
a
free
Berlin

reunion

captive
East_Germany

What
is be%2:42:03::
in
doubt
as
the
free
Germans
and
their
allies
consider consider%2:39:00::
the
voting
trends
is be%2:42:06::
the
nature
of
the
coalition
that
will
result result%2:42:00::
.
If
the
party
of
Adenauer
and
Erhart
,
with
45
per_cent
of
the
vote
,
approaches approach%2:42:00::
the
party
of
Willy_Brandt
,
which
won win%2:40:00::
36
per_cent
,
the
result
would
be be%2:42:06::
a
stiffening
of
the
old
resolve
.
West_Berlin
's
Mayor_Brandt
vigorously
demanded demand%2:32:00::
a
firmer
stand
on
the
dismemberment
of
his
city
and
won win%2:40:00::
votes
by
it
.
The
Free
Democrats
(
12
per_cent
of
the
vote
)
believe believe%2:31:03::
a
nuclear
war
can
be
avoided avoid%2:41:01::
by
negotiating negotiate%2:32:00::
with
the
Soviet_Union
,
and
more
dealings
with
the
Communist
bloc
.
The
question
left leave%2:31:05::
by
the
election
is be%2:42:06::
whether
West_Germany
veers veer%2:38:00::
slightly
toward
more
firmness
or
more
flexibility
.
It
could
go go%2:30:01::
either
way
,
since
the
gains
for
both
points_of_view
were be%2:42:03::
about
the
same
.
Regardless_of
the
decision
two
facts
are be%2:42:03::
clear
.
West_Germany
,
with
its
industrial
and
military
might
,
reaffirmed reaffirm%2:32:00::
its
democracy
and
remains_firm remain_firm%2:42:00::
with
the
free
nations
.
And
the
career
of
Konrad_Adenauer
,
who
upheld uphold%2:42:00::
Germany
's
tradition
of
rock-like
leaders
which
Bismarck
began begin%2:30:01::
,
draws_near draw_near%2:38:00::
the
end
.
Americans
are be%2:42:06::
a
nation
of
joiners
,
a
quality
which
our
friends
find find%2:31:10::
endearing
and
sometimes
amusing
.
But
it
can
be be%2:42:03::
dangerous
if
the
joiner
does
n't
want want%2:37:00::
to
make make%2:30:00::
a
spectacle
of
himself
.
For_instance
,
so-called
``
conservative
''
organizations
,
some
of
them
secret
,
are
sprouting sprout%2:30:00::
in
the
garden
of
joining
where
``
liberal
''
organizations
once
took_root take_root%2:30:01::
.
One
specific
example
is be%2:42:06::
a
secret
``
fraternity
''
which
will
``
coordinate coordinate%2:41:00::
anti-Communist
efforts
''
.
The
principle
is be%2:42:03::
commendable
but
we
suspect suspect%2:31:02::
that
in
the
practice
somebody
is
going_to
get get%2:30:00::
gulled gull%2:32:00::
.
According
to
The
Chicago_Tribune_News_Service
,
State_Atty._Gen._Stanley_Mosk
of
California
has
devised devise%2:36:00::
a
series
of
questions
which
the
joiner
might
well
ask ask%2:32:00::
about
any
organization
seeking seek%2:40:00::
his
money
and
his
name
:
Does
it
assail assail%2:33:00::
schools
and
churches
with
blanket
accusations
?
Does
it
attack attack%2:32:00::
other
traditional
American
institutions
with
unsupportable
and
wild
charges
?
Does
it
put put%2:32:00::
the
label
of
un-American
or
subversive
on
everyone
with
whom
it
disagrees disagree%2:32:00::
politically
?
Does
it
attempt attempt%2:41:00::
to
rewrite rewrite%2:32:00::
modern
history
by
blaming blame%2:31:00::
American
statesmen
for
wars
,
communism
,
depression
,
and
other
troubles
of
the
world
?
Does
it
employ employ%2:34:00::
crude
pressure
tactics
with
such
means
as
anonymous
telephone_calls
and
letter
writing
campaigns
?
Do
its
spokesmen
seem seem%2:39:00::
more
interested
in
the
amount_of_money
they
collect collect%2:40:01::
than
in
the
principles
they
purport purport%2:32:00::
to
advocate advocate%2:32:01::
?
In
some
instances
a
seventh
question
can
be
added add%2:30:00::
:
Does
the
organization
show show%2:39:04::
an
affinity
for
a
foreign
government
,
political_party
or
personality
in_opposition
or
preference
to
the
American
system
?
If
the
would-be
joiner
asks ask%2:32:00::
these
questions
he
is be%2:42:03::
not
likely
to
be
duped dupe%2:32:00::
by
extremists
who
are
seeking seek%2:41:00::
to
capitalize capitalize%2:40:00::
on
the
confusions
and
the
patriotic
apprehensions
of
Americans
in
a
troubled
time
.
Falling fall%2:42:03::
somewhere
in
a
category
between
Einstein
's
theory
and
sand_fleas
-
difficult
to
see see%2:39:00::
but
undeniably
there
,
nevertheless

is be%2:42:05::
the
tropical
green

a
string
of
offshore
islands
that

an
unlimited
future

The
latter
is be%2:42:06::
what
concerns

The

The
only
real
problem
is be%2:42:06::
to
devise devise%2:36:00::
a
plan
whereby
the
owners
of
the
above-water

can
develop develop%2:30:04::

its

In

fairly
brief

hectic
history

the
developers
of
waterfront
land
have
too
often
wound_up wind_up%2:30:01::
with
both
their

happily

insistence
is
being
made make%2:36:08::
that
our
share
is
protected protect%2:33:00::

And

protection

The
reaction
of
certain
City_Council
members
to
California
's
newest
anti-secrecy
laws
was be%2:42:03::
as
dismaying
as
it
was be%2:42:03::
disappointing

We
had

no

The

has
taken take%2:42:00::
the
efforts
of
five
sessions

not

Despite

Without
