The
superb
intellectual
and
spiritual
vitality
of
William_James
was be%2:42:03::
never
more
evident
than
in
his
letters
.
Here
was be%2:42:03::
a
man
with
an
enormous
gift
for
living
as_well
as
thinking
.
To
both
persons
and
ideas
he
brought bring%2:36:00::
the
same
delighted
interest
,
the
same
open-minded
relish
for
what
was be%2:42:03::
unique
in
each
,
the
same
discriminating
sensibility
and
quicksilver
intelligence
,
the
same
gallantry
of
judgment
.
For
this
latest
addition
to
the
Great
Letters
Series
,
under
the
general
editorship
of
Louis_Kronenberger
,
Miss_Hardwick
has
made make%2:36:12::
a
selection
which
admirably
displays display%2:39:00::
the
variety
of
James
's
genius
,
not_to_mention
the
felicities
of
his
style
.
And_how
he
could
write write%2:36:00::
!
His
famous
criticism
of
brother
Henry
's
``
third
style
''
is be%2:42:03::
surely
as
subtly
,
even
elegantly
,
worded
an
analysis
of
the
latter
's
intricate
air_castles
as
Henry
himself
could
ever
have
produced produce%2:36:00::
.
His
letter
to
his
daughter
on
the
pains
of
growing_up
is be%2:42:03::
surely
as
trenchant
,
forthright
,
and
warmly
understanding
a_piece
of
advice
as
ever
a
grown-up
penned pen%2:36:00::
to
a
sensitive
child
,
and
with
just
the
right
tone
of
unpatronizing
good_humor
.
Most_of_all
,
his
letters
to
his
philosophic
colleagues
show show%2:39:00::
a
magnanimity
as_well
as
an
honesty
which
help help%2:41:00::
to
explain explain%2:32:00::
Whitehead
's
reference_to
James
as
``
that
adorable
genius
''
.
Miss_Hardwick
speaks speak%2:32:00::
of
his
``
superb
gift
for
intellectual
friendship
''
,
and
it
is be%2:42:03::
certainly
a
joy
to
see see%2:39:02::
the
intellectual
life
lived live%2:42:06::
so
free
from
either
academic
aridity
or
passionate
dogmatism
.
This
is be%2:42:03::
a
virtue
of_which
we
have have%2:40:00::
great
need
in
a
society
where
there
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
an
increasing
lack
of
communication
-
or
even
desire
for
communication
-
between
differing
schools_of_thought
.
It
holds hold%2:40:00::
an
equally
valuable
lesson
for
a
society
where
the
word
``
intellectual
''
has
become become%2:42:01::
a
term
of
opprobrium
to
millions
of
well-meaning
people
who
somehow
imagine imagine%2:36:00::
that
it
must
be be%2:42:03::
destructive
of
the
simpler
human
virtues
.
To
his
Harvard
colleague
,
Josiah_Royce
,
whose
philosophic
position
differed differ%2:42:00::
radically
from
his
own
,
James
could
write write%2:36:00::
,
``
Different
as
our
minds
are be%2:42:03::
,
yours
has
nourished nourish%2:34:00::
mine
,
as
no
other
social
influence
ever
has
,
and
in
converse
with
you
I
have
always
felt feel%2:31:00::
that
my
life
was
being
lived live%2:42:06::
importantly
''
.
Of
another
colleague
,
George_Santayana
,
he
could
write write%2:36:00::
:
``
The
great
event
in
my
life
recently
has
been be%2:42:03::
the
reading
of
Santayana
's
book
.
Although
I
absolutely
reject reject%2:40:00::
the
Platonism
of_it
,
I
have
literally
squealed squeal%2:32:01::
with
delight
at
the
imperturbable
perfection
with
which
the
position
is
laid_down lay_down%2:31:00::
on
page
after
page
''
.
Writing write%2:36:00::
to
his
colleague
George_Herbert_Palmer
-
``
Glorious
old
Palmer
''
,
as
he
addresses address%2:32:03::
him
-
James
says say%2:32:00::
that
if
only
the
students
at
Harvard
could
really
understand understand%2:31:00::
Royce
,
Santayana
,
Palmer
,
and
himself
and
see see%2:31:01::
that
their
varying
systems
are be%2:42:03::
``
so
many
religions
,
ways
of
fronting front%2:33:00::
life
,
and
worth
fighting fight%2:41:10::
for
''
,
then
Harvard
would
have have%2:40:00::
a
genuine
philosophic
universe
.
``
The
best
condition
of_it
would
be be%2:42:03::
an
open
conflict
and
rivalry
of
the
diverse
systems
.
The
world
might
ring ring%2:39:04::
with
the
struggle
,
if
we
devoted devote%2:32:00::
ourselves
exclusively
to
belaboring belabor%2:41:00::
each
other
''
.
The
``
belaboring
''
is be%2:42:03::
of_course
jocular
,
yet
James
was be%2:42:03::
not
lacking
in
fundamental
seriousness
-
unless
we
measure measure%2:30:00::
him
by
that
ultimate
seriousness
of
the
great
religious_leader
or
thinker
who
stakes stake%2:41:00::
all
on
his
vision
of
God
.
To
James
this
vision
never
quite
came come%2:30:01::
,
despite
his
appreciation
of_it
in
others
.
But
there
is be%2:42:03::
a
dignity
and
even
a
hint
of
the
inspired
prophet
in
his
words
to
one
correspondent
:
``
You
ask ask%2:32:00::
what
I
am
going_to
'
reply reply%2:32:00::
'
to
Bradley
.
But
why
need need%2:42:00::
one
reply reply%2:32:00::
to
everything
and
everybody
?
I
think think%2:31:03::
that
readers
generally
hate hate%2:37:00::
minute
polemics
and
recriminations
.
All
polemic
of
ours
should
,
I
believe believe%2:31:04::
,
be be%2:42:03::
either
very
broad
statements
of
contrast
,
or
fine
points
treated treat%2:41:00::
singly
,
and
as_far_as_possible
impersonally
.
As
far
as
the
rising
generation
goes
,
why
not
simply
express express%2:32:00::
ourselves
positively
,
and
trust trust%2:41:00::
that
the
truer
view
quietly
will
displace displace%2:38:01::
the
other
.
Here
again

God
will
know know%2:31:00::
his

'
.
The
collected
works
of
James_Thurber
,
now
numbering number%2:42:00::
25
volumes
(
including include%2:42:00::
the

exhibit

a
high
standard
of
literary
excellence

as
every
schoolboy

The
primitive-eclogue
quality
of
his
drawings
,
akin
to_that
of
graffiti

on
a
cave

About
all
that

to
be

if
any

is

in
the
initial
article
entitled
:
``

and
``
The
Watchers

is be%2:42:06::
a
veritable
waking
nightmare
.
A
semi-serious
literary
document
entitled
``
The
Wings
of
Henry_James
''
is be%2:42:03::
noteworthy
,
if
only
for
a
keenly
trenchant
though
little-known
comment
on
the
master
's
difficult
later
period
by
modest
Owen_Wister
,
author
of
``
The
Virginian
''
.
James
,
he
remarks remark%2:32:00::
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
,
``
is
attempting attempt%2:36:00::
the
impossible
,
namely
,
to
produce produce%2:36:02::
upon
the
reader
,
as
a
painting
produces produce%2:36:02::
upon
the
gazer
,
a_number_of
superimposed
,
simultaneous
impressions
.
He
would would%2:42:00::
like like%2:37:01::
to
put put%2:35:05::
several
sentences
on
top
of
each
other
so_that
you
could
read read%2:31:00::
them
all_at_once
,
and
get get%2:39:00::
all_at_once
,
the
various
shadings
and
complexities
''
.
Equally
penetrating
in
its
fashion
is be%2:42:03::
the
following
remark
by
a
lady
in
the
course
of
a
literary
conversation
:
``
So_much
has
already
been
written write%2:36:00::
about
everything
that
you
can
n't
find_out find_out%2:32:00::
anything
about
it
''
.
Or
the
mildly
epigrammatic
utterance
(
also
a
quotation
)
:
``
Woman
's
place
is be%2:42:03::
in
the
wrong
''
.
Who
but
Thurber
can
be
counted_on count_on%2:31:01::
to
glean glean%2:35:00::
such
nectareous
essences
?
A
tribute
to
midsummer
``
bang-sashes
''
seems seem%2:39:00::
terribly
funny
,
though
it
would
be be%2:42:03::
hard
to
explain explain%2:32:00::
why
.
``
One
of
them
banged bang%2:39:00::
the
sash
of
the
window
nearest
my
bed
around
midnight
in
July
and
I
leaped leap%2:38:00::
out
of
sleep
and
out_of_bed
.
'
It
's be%2:42:06::
just
a
bat

said say%2:32:00::
my
wife

I

with
relief
.

God
for
that

I
said say%2:32:00::
;
'
I
thought think%2:31:01::
it
was be%2:42:06::
a
human_being
''
'
.
In_a_sense
,
perhaps
,
Thurber
is be%2:42:03::
indebted
artistically
to
the
surrealist
painter
(
was be%2:42:06::
it
Salvador_Dali
?
)
who
first
conceived conceive%2:36:00::
the
startling
fancy
of
a
picture_window
in
the
abdomen
.
That_is
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
literally
a
picture_window
:
you
do
n't
see see%2:39:00::
into
the
viscera
;
you
see see%2:39:00::
a
picture
-
trees
,
or
flowers
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
something
like
what
Thurber
's
best
effects
are be%2:42:03::
like
,
if
I
am be%2:42:03::
not
mistaken
.
Though
no_longer
able
to
turn_out turn_out%2:36:00::
his
protoplasmic
pen-and-ink
sketches
(
several
old
favorites
are be%2:42:03::
scattered
through
the
present
volume
)
Thurber
has
retained retain%2:40:01::
unimpaired
his
vision
of
humor
as
a
thing
of
simple
,
unaffected
humanness
.
In
his
concluding
paragraph
he
writes write%2:36:00::
:
``
The
devoted
writer
of
humor
will
continue continue%2:42:01::
to
try try%2:41:00::
to
come come%2:38:00::
as
close_to
truth
as
he
can
''
.
For
many
readers
Thurber
comes come%2:38:00::
closer
than
anyone
else
in_sight
.
The
latest
Low
is be%2:42:06::
a
puzzler
.
The
master
's
hand
has
lost lose%2:40:02::
none
of
its
craft
.
He
is be%2:42:03::
at
his
usual
best
in
exposing expose%2:35:00::
the
shams
and
self-deceptions
of
political
and
diplomatic
life
in
the
fifties
.
The
reader
meets meet%2:41:01::
a_few
old
friends
like
Blimp
and
the
TUC
horse
,
and
becomes become%2:30:00::
better
acquainted_with
new
members
of
the
cast_of_characters
like
the
bomb
itself
,
and
civilization
in
her
classic
robe
watching watch%2:39:05::
the
nuclear
arms_race
,
her
hair
standing stand%2:35:00::
straight
out
.
But
there
is be%2:42:03::
a
difference
between
the
present
volume
and
the
early
Low
.
There
is be%2:42:03::
fear
in
the
fifties
as
his
title
suggests suggest%2:32:04::
and
as
his
competent
drawings
show show%2:39:00::
.
But
there
was be%2:42:03::
terror
in
the
thirties
when
the
Nazis
were be%2:42:03::
on_the_loose
and
in
those
days
Low
struck strike%2:35:01::
like
lightning
.
Anyone
can
draw draw%2:31:00::
his
own
conclusions
from
this
difference
.
It
might
be
argued argue%2:32:02::
that
the
Communists
are be%2:42:03::
less
inhuman
than
the
Nazis
and
furnish furnish%2:40:00::
the
artist
with
drama
in
a
lower
key
.
But
this
argument
cannot
be
pushed push%2:32:00::
very
far
because
the
Communist
system
makes_up make_up%2:40:00::
for
any
shortcomings
of
its
leaders
in
respect_to
corrosion
.
The
Communists
wield wield%2:40:00::
a
power
unknown
to
Hitler
.
And
the
leading
issue
,
that
of
piecemeal
aggression
,
remains remain%2:30:00::
the
same
.
This
is be%2:42:03::
drama
enough
.
Do
we
ourselves
offer offer%2:40:02::
Mr._Low
less
of
a
crusade
?
In
the
thirties
we
would
not
face face%2:33:00::
our
enemy
;
that
was be%2:42:03::
a
nightmarish
situation
and
Low
was be%2:42:04::
in
his
element
.
Now
we
have
stood_up stand_up%2:32:00::
to
the
Communists
;
we
are be%2:42:03::
stronger
and
more
self-confident
-
and
Low
cannot
so
easily
put put%2:35:05::
us
to
rights
.
Or
does
the
reason
for
less
Jovian
drawings
lie lie%2:42:01::
elsewhere
?
It
might
be be%2:42:03::
that
Low
has
seen see%2:39:02::
too
many
stupidities
and
that
they
do
not
outrage outrage%2:37:01::
him
now
.
He
writes write%2:36:00::
,
``
Confucius
held hold%2:37:00::
that
in
times
of
stress
one
should
take
short
views
-
only
up_to
lunchtime
''
.
Whatever
the
cause
,
his
mood
in
the
fifties
rarely
rises rise%2:30:00::
above
the
level
of
the
capably
sardonic
.
Dulles
?
He
does
not
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
have
caught catch%2:39:01::
the
subtleties
of
the
man
.
McCarthy
?
The
skies
turn turn%2:30:03::
dark
but
the
clouds
do
not
loose loose%2:41:00::
their
wrath
.
Suez
?
Low
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
have
supported support%2:41:00::
Eden
at_first
and_then
relented relent%2:42:00::
because
things
worked_out work_out%2:30:00::
differently
,
so
there
is be%2:42:04::
no
fire
in
his
eye
.
Stalin
's
death
,
Churchill
's
farewell
to
public
life
,
Hillary
and
Tensing
on
Everest
,
Quemoy
and
Matsu
-
all
subjects
for
a
noble
anger
or
an
accolade
.
Instead
the
cartoons
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
deal deal%2:32:08::
with
foibles
.
Their
Eisenhower
is be%2:42:03::
insubstantial
.
Did
Low
decide decide%2:31:00::
to
let let%2:30:00::
well
enough
alone
when
he
made make%2:36:12::
his
selections
?
He
often
drew draw%2:36:00::
the
bomb
.
He
showed show%2:39:02::
puny
men
attacked attack%2:33:00::
by
splendidly
tyrannical
machines
.
And
Khrushchev
