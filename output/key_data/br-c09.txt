Here

as
in
``

,
Mr._Louis
has
given give%2:40:03::
himself
the
lion
's
share
of
the
dancing
,
and
there
is be%2:42:03::
no_doubt
that
he
is be%2:42:03::
capable_of
conceiving conceive%2:36:00::
and
executing execute%2:41:02::
a
wide
variety
of
difficult

arresting
physical
movements
.
Indeed
,
both
``

``

qualify qualify%2:42:00::
as
instructive
catalogues
of
modern-dance

But
chains
of
movements
are be%2:42:03::
not
necessarily
communicative
,
and
it
is be%2:42:04::
in
the
realm
of
communication
that
the
works
prove prove%2:42:00::
disappointing
.
One
frequently
has have%2:39:06::
the
feeling
that
the
order
of
their
movement
combinations
could
be
transposed transpose%2:30:02::
without
notable
loss
of
effect
,
there
is be%2:42:03::
too
little
suggestion
of
organic
relationship
and
development
.
It
may
be be%2:42:03::
,
of_course
,
that
Mr._Louis
is
consciously
trying try%2:41:00::
to
create create%2:36:01::
works
that
anticipate anticipate%2:32:00::
an
age

But
it
may
be be%2:42:03::
,
also
,
that
he
is be%2:42:03::
merely
more
mindful
of
athletics
than
of
esthetics
at_the_present_time
.
One
thing
is be%2:42:03::
certain
,
however
,
and
that
is be%2:42:03::
that
he
is be%2:42:03::

more
slavish
to
the

piece
about

the
three
``
figures

that
bother bother%2:41:01::

Unfortunately
,
the
man

were
not
made make%2:30:00::

appear appear%2:39:00::
very
interesting
at

the

figures
failed fail%2:41:02::

them
any_more

Nor
did

The
music
here
,
Russell_Smith
's
``
Tetrameron

sounded sound%2:39:03::
good

All
the
performances
of
the
evening
were be%2:42:03::
smooth

assured

and
the
sizable
company

with
Mr._Nagrin

leading
dancers

seemed seem%2:39:01::
to
be be%2:42:03::

brought bring%2:36:00::
applause
from
the
2800
persons
who
filled fill%2:30:01::
the
hall
.
They
showed show%2:32:02::
they
were be%2:42:03::
glad
that
Carnegie
would
have have%2:42:00::
a
major
orchestra
playing play%2:36:12::
there
so
often
next
season
to
take_up take_up%2:42:00::
the
slack
with
the
departure
to
Lincoln_Center
of
the
New_York
Philharmonic
,
the
Philadelphia_Orchestra
and
the
Boston_Symphony
.
This
season
the
orchestra
has
already
taken take%2:41:04::
a
step
toward
the
suburbs
in_that
it
is
giving give%2:40:03::
six
subscription
concerts
for
the
Orchestral_Society
of
Westchester

The
details
of
the
suburban
concerts
next
season
,
and
the
centers
in_which
they
will
be
given give%2:36:02::
,
will
be
announced announce%2:32:00::
later
,
Mr._Toobin
said say%2:32:00::
.
The
concertos
that
Van_Cliburn
has
been
associated
with
in
New_York
since
his
triumphant
return
from
Russia
in
1958
have
been be%2:42:03::
the
Tchaikovsky
,
the
Rachmaninoff_Third
,
and
the
Prokofieff_Third
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
pleasant
last
night
,
therefore
,
to
hear hear%2:39:00::
him
do do%2:41:01::
something
else
:
a
concerto
he
has
recently
recorded record%2:32:01::
,
``
The
Emperor
''
.
The
young
Texas
pianist
can
make make%2:41:00::
great
chords
ring_out ring_out%2:39:00::
as_well
as
anyone
,
so
last
night
the
massive
sonorities
of_this
challenging
concerto
were be%2:42:06::
no
hazard
to
him
.
But
they
were be%2:42:06::
not
what
distinguished distinguish%2:31:02::
his
performance
.
The
elements
that
did
were be%2:42:03::
the
introspective
slow
movement
,
the
beautiful
transition
to
the
third
movement
,
and
the
passages
of
filigree
that
laced lace%2:35:01::
through
the
bigger
moments
of
the
opening
movement
and
the
final
Rondo
.
Mr._Cliburn
gave give%2:40:03::
the
slow
movement
some
of
the
quality
of
a
Chopin_Nocturne
.
Alfred_Wallenstein
,
the
conductor
,
sensitive
accompanist
that
he
is be%2:42:03::
,
picked_up pick_up%2:39:01::
the
idea
and
led lead%2:36:00::
the
orchestra
here
with
a
sense
of
broodinf
,
poetic
mystery
.
The
collaboration
was be%2:42:03::
remarkable
,
as
it
was be%2:42:03::
in
both
the
other
movements
,
too
.
Mr._Wallenstein
,
who
will
lead lead%2:36:00::
all_of
the
concerts
in
the
cycle
,
also
conducted conduct%2:36:00::
the
``
Leonore
''
Overture
No.
3
and
the
Fourth_Symphony
.
The
orchestra
was be%2:42:03::
obviously
on
its
mettle
and
it
played play%2:36:12::
most
responsively
.
And
although
there
was be%2:42:03::
plenty
of
vigor
in
the
performance
,
the
ensemble
was be%2:42:03::
at
its
best
when
the
playing
was be%2:42:03::
soft
and
lyrical
,
yet
full_of
the
suppressed
tension
that
is be%2:42:03::
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
Beethoven
.
Igor_Oistrakh
will
be be%2:42:06::
the
next
soloist
on
Feb.
4
.
There
are be%2:42:00::
times
when
one
suspects suspect%2:32:00::
that
the
songs
that
are
dropped drop%2:41:01::
from
musical
shows
before
they
reach reach%2:38:00::
Broadway
may
really
be be%2:42:03::
better
than
many_of
those
that
are_left
in
.
Today
,
in
the
era
of
the
integrated
musical
when
an
individual
song
must
contribute contribute%2:40:01::
to
the
over-all
development
of
the
show
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
understandable
that
a
song
,
no_matter_how
excellent
it
may
be be%2:42:03::
on
its
own
terms
,
is
cut_out cut_out%2:30:00::
because
it
does
not
perform perform%2:41:02::
the
function
required require%2:32:00::
of_it
.
In
the
more
casually
constructed
musicals
of
the
Nineteen
Twenties
and
Nineteen
Thirties
there
would
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
have
been be%2:42:03::
less
reason
for
eliminating eliminate%2:30:01::
a
song
of
merit
.
Yet
there
is be%2:42:04::
the
classic
case
of
the
Gershwins
'
``
The_Man_I_Love
''
.
Deemed deem%2:31:00::
too
static
when
it
was
first
heard hear%2:39:00::
in
``
Lady
Be be%2:42:03::
Good
''
in
Philadelphia
in
1924
,
it
was
dropped drop%2:41:01::
from
the
score
.
It
was
heard hear%2:39:00::
again
in
Philadelphia
in
1927
in
the
first
version
of
``
Strike_Up strike_up%2:36:01::
the
Band
''
and
again
abandoned abandon%2:38:00::
shortly
before
the
entire
show
was
given_up give_up%2:40:02::
.
It
finally
reached reach%2:38:01::
Broadway
in
the
second
and
successful
version
of
``
Strike_Up strike_up%2:36:01::
the
Band
''
in
1929
.
(
Still
another
song
in
``
Strike_Up strike_up%2:36:01::
the
Band
''
-
``
I
've_Got_a_Crush_on_You
''
-
was
retrieved retrieve%2:40:00::
from
a
1928
failure
,
``
Treasure_Girl
''
)
.
Like
the
Gershwins
,
Richard_Rodgers
and
Lorenz_Hart
were be%2:42:03::
loath
to
let let%2:41:00::
a
good
song
get_away get_away%2:38:00::
from
them
.
If
one
of
Mr._Rodgers
'
melodies
seemed seem%2:39:01::
to
deserve deserve%2:42:00::
a
better
fate
than
interment
in
Boston
or
the
obscurity
of
a
Broadway
failure
,
Mr._Hart
was be%2:42:03::
likely
to
deck deck_out%2:29:00::
it
out
with
new
lyrics
to
give give%2:40:03::
it
a
second
chance
in
