With

around
the
immense

round

The

,
came come%2:42:04::
from
the
Temple
of
Artemis
at
Ephesus
,
the

Beneath

with
the_Blue
Mosque

Across

I
saw see%2:39:00::
the
Hippodrome

It
was
laid_out lay_out%2:35:00::

there
were
stolen steal%2:40:00::
,
mostly
by
the
waves
of
Crusaders
.
At
the
beginning
of
the
Hippodrome
I
saw see%2:39:00::
the
Kaiser

Fountain
,
