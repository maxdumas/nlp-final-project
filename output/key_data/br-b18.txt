For_the_first_time
in
history
the
entire
world
is be%2:42:03::
dominated_by
two
large
,
powerful
nations
armed
with
murderous
nuclear_weapons
that
make make%2:30:00::
conventional
warfare
of
the
past
a
nullity
.
The
United_States
and
Soviet_Russia
have have%2:40:00::
enough
nuclear_weapons
to
destroy destroy%2:35:00::
all
nations
.
Recent
statements
by
well-known
scientists
regarding
the
destructive
power
of
the
newest
nuclear
bombs
and
the
deadly
fall-outs
should
be be%2:42:03::
sufficient
to
still still%2:30:00::
the
voices
of
those
who
advocate advocate%2:32:00::
nuclear
warfare
instead
of
negotiations
.
President_Kennedy
was be%2:42:03::
right
when
he
said say%2:32:00::
,
``
We
shall
never
negotiate negotiate%2:32:00::
out
of
fear
and
we
never
shall
fear fear%2:37:03::
to
negotiate negotiate%2:32:00::
''
.
I
have
just
returned return%2:38:00::
from
a
seven-week
trip
to
Europe
and
the
Far_East
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
quite
evident
that
the
people
of
Western
Europe
are be%2:42:03::
overwhelmingly
opposed
to
participation
in
a
nuclear
war
.
The
fact
is be%2:42:03::
that
the
Italians
,
French
and
British
know know%2:31:01::
that
they
have have%2:40:00::
no
defense
against
nuclear
bombs
.
We
have have%2:40:00::
no
right
to
criticize criticize%2:32:00::
them
,
as
they
realize realize%2:31:01::
they
would
be be%2:42:03::
sitting_ducks
in
a
nuclear
war
.
We
should
stand stand%2:42:00::
firmly
and
courageously
for
our
right
to
free
access
into
Berlin
.
It
would
be be%2:42:03::
criminal
folly
if
the
Communists
tried try%2:41:00::
to
prevent prevent%2:41:00::
us
.
But
there
is be%2:42:03::
nothing
we
can
do do%2:41:01::
to
stop stop%2:41:00::
Soviet_Russia
from
granting grant%2:32:00::
de_facto
recognition
to
East_Germany
.
Soviet_Russia
has
been
invaded invade%2:33:00::
twice
by
German
troops
in
a
generation
.
In
the
last
war
Russia
lost lose%2:40:02::
more_than
ten
million
killed kill%2:35:00::
and
its
lands
and
factories
were
devastated devastate%2:30:00::
.
The
truth
is be%2:42:06::
that
Communist_Russia
fears fear%2:37:03::
the
resurgence
of
German
militarism
.
Berlin
is
merely
being
used use%2:34:01::
by
Moscow
as
a
stalking_horse
.
Actually
,
the
Communists
,
out
of
fear
of
a
united
and
armed
Germany
,
would
probably
be be%2:42:03::
willing
to
agree agree%2:32:01::
to
a
disarmed
Germany
that
would
be be%2:42:03::
united
and
neutral
and
have have%2:40:00::
its
independence
guaranteed guarantee%2:32:01::
by
the
U._N.
.
If
the
Communists
are be%2:42:03::
sincere
in
wanting want%2:37:00::
a
united
,
neutral
and
disarmed
Germany
,
it
might
well
be be%2:42:03::
advantageous
for
the
German
people
in_this
nuclear
age
.
It
could
provide provide%2:40:00::
security
without
cost
of
armaments
and
increase increase%2:30:02::
German
prosperity
and
lessen lessen%2:30:00::
taxation
.
France
and
other
Western
European_nations
likewise
fear fear%2:37:03::
a
rearmed
Germany
.
If
the
German
people
favor favor%2:41:00::
such
a
settlement
we
should
not
oppose oppose%2:32:01::
Germany
following follow%2:36:00::
the
example
of
Austria
.
President_Kennedy
has
urged urge%2:32:03::
a
peace
race
on
disarmament
that
might
be be%2:42:03::
called
``
Operation_Survival
''
which
has have%2:42:00::
many
facets
.
Why
not
make make%2:36:00::
a
beginning
with
a
united
and
disarmed
Germany
whose
neutrality
and
immunity
from
nuclear
bombing
would
be
guaranteed guarantee%2:32:00::
by
the
Big
Four
powers
and
the
United_States
?
A
united
Germany
,
freed
of
militarism
,
might
be be%2:42:03::
the
first
step
toward
disarmament
and
peace
in
a
terrorized
and
tortured
world
.
In

you
make

``

to
the
lack

Yet
your
list
of
things
left leave%2:42:02::
undone
did
not
include include%2:42:00::
repeal
of
the
Connally
amendment
to
this
country
's

to
its
Adherence
to
the
Statute

The

If

by

As

I
have have%2:42:05::
to
use use%2:34:01::
the
telephone
constantly
,
from
three

four
hours
a
day

In
the
last
few
years
the
telephone_company
has
managed manage%2:41:09::
to
automate automate%2:30:00::
many
areas

their
service

It
has
not
been be%2:42:06::
any

keep_up keep_up%2:30:00::
with

there
are be%2:42:03::
still
several

necessitate necessitate%2:42:00::
the
