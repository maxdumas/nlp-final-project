Interviews
with
several
church
leaders
have
disclosed disclose%2:32:00::
that
this
development
has
raised raise%2:32:00::
the
question
whether
the
Peace_Corps
will
be be%2:42:03::
able
to
prevent prevent%2:41:01::
confusion
for
church
and
state
over
methods

There
are be%2:42:00::
a_number_of
ways
this
could
happen happen%2:30:00::
,
the
churchmen
pointed_out point_out%2:32:01::
,
and
here
is be%2:42:04::
an
example
:
Last
month
in
Ghana
an
American
missionary
discovered discover%2:31:00::
when
he
came_to
pay pay%2:40:04::
his
hotel_bill
that
the
usual
rate
had
been
doubled double%2:30:00::
.
When
he
protested protest%2:32:00::
,
the
hotel
owner
said say%2:32:00::
:
``
Why
do
you
worry worry%2:37:00::
?
The
U._S._Government
is
paying pay%2:40:00::
for
it
.
The
U._S._Government
pays pay%2:40:00::

``
I
do

the
American

.
``
I

''
.
The
hotel
owner
shrugged shrug%2:29:00::
.
``
Same
thing
''
,
he
said say%2:32:00::
.
And_then
,
some
churchmen
remarked remark%2:32:00::
,
there
is be%2:42:00::
a
more
classical
church-state
problem
:
Can
religious
agencies
use use%2:34:01::
Government
funds
and
Peace_Corps
personnel
in
their
projects
and
still
preserve preserve%2:42:00::
the
constitutional
requirement
on
separation
of
church
and
state
?
R._Sargent_Shriver_Jr.
,
director
of
the
corps
,
is be%2:42:03::
certain
that
they
can
.
No
religious
group
,
he
declared declare%2:32:01::
in
an
interview
,
will
receive receive%2:40:00::
Peace_Corps
