I

,
the

I

the

incomparably

the

.
This
work
is be%2:42:03::
no
favorite
of
mine

I
am be%2:42:03::
prepared
to
demonstrate demonstrate%2:39:00::
at
an
ytime
that
it
represents represent%2:42:01::
the
spirit
of
Imperial_Russia
in
its
most
vulgar
,
infantile
,
and
reactionary
aspect
;
that
its
persistent
use
by
ballet_companies
of
the
Soviet
regime
indicates indicate%2:32:01::
that
that
old
spirit
is be%2:42:03::
just_as
stultifying
alive
today
as
it
ever
was be%2:42:03::
;
that
its
presentation
in_this
country
is be%2:42:03::
part
of
a
capitalist
plot
to
boobify
the
American
people
;
that
its
choreography
is be%2:42:03::
undistinguished
and
its
score
a
shapeless
assemblage
of
self-plagiarisms
.
All_of
this
is be%2:42:03::
true
and
all_of
it
is be%2:42:03::
totally
meaningless
in
the
face
of
the
Kirov
's
utterly
captivating
presentation
.
The
reasons
for
this
enchantment
are be%2:42:03::
numerous
,
but
most_of
them
end end%2:42:00::
in
``

``

no

would

,
and
it
took take%2:40:06::

a
while
to

the
crowning
virtue
that
completes complete%2:30:00::
this
company

It
is be%2:42:03::
a
kind_of
friendliness

frankness
of
address
toward
the
audience
which
we
have
been
led lead%2:32:00::
to

This
is be%2:42:03::
all

because

is be%2:42:03::
to

at_least
some

for

.
For
a
good
many
seasons
I
've
been
looking look%2:39:00::
at
the
naughty
stuff
on
television
,
so
the
other
night
I
thought think%2:31:03::
I
ought
to
see see%2:31:02::
how
immorality
is
doing do%2:42:00::
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
in
movies
.
After_all
,
this
year
's
movies
are be%2:42:06::
next
year
's
television_shows
.
So
I
went go%2:38:00::
to
see see%2:39:03::
``
La_Dolce_Vita
''
.
It
has
been
billed bill%2:32:00::
as
a
towering
monument
to
immorality
.
All
the
sins
of
ancient
Rome
are
said say%2:32:01::
to
be
collected collect%2:35:00::
into
this
three-hour
film
.
If
that
's
all
the
Romans
did do%2:36:01::
,
it
's
a
surprise
to
me
that
Rome
fell fall%2:40:05::
.
After
television
,
``
La_Dolce_Vita
''
seems seem%2:39:00::
as
harmless
as
a
Gray_Line
tour
of
North_Beach
at
night
.
I
cannot
imagine imagine%2:36:00::
a
single
scene
that_is
n't
done do%2:36:01::
in
a
far
naughtier
manner
on
TV
every_week
.
I
believe believe%2:31:03::
TV
watchers
will
be
bored bore%2:37:00::
.
``
La_Dolce_Vita
''
has have%2:42:00::
none
of
the
senseless
brutality
or
sadism
of
the
average
TV
Western
.
Week
in
,
week
out
,
there
is be%2:42:04::
more
sex
to
be
seen see%2:39:00::
in
``
The
Adventures
of
Ozzie
and
Harriet
''
.
There
is be%2:42:04::
more
decadence
on
``
77
Sunset_Strip
''
.
There
are be%2:42:04::
more
obvious
nymphomaniacs
on
any
private-eye
series
.
In
another
respect
,
television
viewers
will
feel feel%2:37:00::
right
at_home
because
most_of
the
actors
are be%2:42:03::
unknowns
.
With
the
exception
of
Lex_Barker
and
Anita_Ekberg
,
the
credits
are be%2:42:03::
as
unfamiliar
as
you
'll
find find%2:40:02::
on
the
Robert_Herridge_Theater
.
Most_of
the
emphasis
has
been
placed place%2:33:03::
on
a
``
wild
party
''
at
a
seaside
villa
.
Producer
Fellini
should
have
looked look%2:39:00::
at
some
of
the
old
silent
films
where
they
really
had have%2:36:00::
parties
!
The
Dolce_Vita
get-together
boasted boast%2:42:00::
a
strip
tease
(
carried carry%2:41:00::
as
far
as
a
black
slip
)
;
a
lady
drunk

carries carry%2:35:02::
the
hero
around
on

back
while
he
throws throw%2:35:00::
pillow
feathers
in
her
face
;
a
frigid
beauty
,
and
three
silly
fairies
.
Put put%2:35:05::
them
all_together
and
they
spell_out spell%2:36:00::
the
only
four-letter
word
I
can
think_of think_of%2:36:00::
:
dull
.
Apparently
Fellini
caught catch%2:35:01::
the
crowd
when
its
parties
had
begun begin%2:30:00::
to
pall pall%2:30:01::
.
What
a
swinging
group
they
must
have
been be%2:42:03::
when
they
first
started start%2:30:00::
entertaining
!
As
a
moral
shocker
it
is be%2:42:03::
a
dud
.
But
this
does
n't
detract detract%2:30:04::
from
its
merit
as
an
interesting
,
if_not
great
,
film
.
The
Chronicle
's
Paine_Knickerbocker
summed sum_up%2:32:00::
it
up
neatly
:
``
This
is be%2:42:03::
a
long
picture
and
a
controversial
one
,
but
basically
it
is be%2:42:03::
a
