Mercer
stammered stammer%2:32:00::
,
not
knowing know%2:31:01::
what
B
'
dikkat
meant mean%2:32:01::
,
and
the
two-nosed
man
answered answer%2:32:00::
for

``

.
Mercer
never
noticed notice%2:39:04::
the
needle
touch touch%2:35:00::
his
arm
.
B
'
dikkat
had
turned_to turn_to%2:30:00::
the
next
knot
of
people
when
the
super-condamine
hit hit%2:35:05::
Mercer
.
He
tried try%2:41:00::
to
run run%2:38:00::
after
B

,
to
hug hug%2:35:01::
the
lead

to

that
he
loved love%2:37:00::

He
stumbled stumble%2:38:00::
and
fell fall%2:38:03::
,
but
it
did
not
hurt hurt%2:39:00::
.
The
many-bodied
girl
lay lie%2:35:00::
near
him
.
Mercer
spoke_to speak_to%2:32:00::
her
.
``
Is
n't
it
wonderful
?
You

I

so
happy
to
be be%2:42:05::
here
''
.
The
woman
covered
with
growing
hands
came come%2:38:00::
and
sat sit%2:35:00::
beside
them
.
She
radiated radiate%2:30:00::
warmth
and
good_fellowship
.
Mercer
thought think%2:31:01::
that
she
looked look%2:39:01::
very
distinguished
and
charming
.
He
struggled struggle%2:38:00::
out
of
his
clothes
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
foolish
and
snobbish
to
wear wear%2:29:00::
clothing
when
none
of
these
nice
people
did
.
The
two
women
babbled babble%2:32:00::
and
crooned croon%2:32:00::
at
him
.
With
one
corner
of
his
mind
he
knew know%2:31:01::
that
they
were
saying say%2:32:00::
nothing
,
just
expressing express%2:32:01::
the
euphoria
of
a
drug
so
powerful
that
the
known
universe
had
forbidden forbid%2:32:00::
it
.
With
most_of
his
mind
he
was be%2:42:03::
happy
.
He
wondered wonder%2:31:00::
how
anyone
could
have have%2:40:00::
the
good_luck
to
visit visit%2:41:02::
a
planet
as
nice
as
this
.
He
tried try%2:41:00::
to
tell tell%2:32:04::
the
Lady_Da
,
but
the
words
were be%2:42:03::
n't
quite
straight
.
A
painful
stab
hit hit%2:35:05::
him
in
the
abdomen
.
The
drug
went_after go_after%2:38:01::
the
pain
and
swallowed swallow%2:35:00::
it
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
like
the
cap
in
the
hospital
,
only
a_thousand_times
better
.
The
pain
was be%2:42:03::
gone
,
though
it
had
been be%2:42:03::
crippling
the
first
time
.
He
forced force%2:41:00::
himself
to
be be%2:42:03::
deliberate
.
He
rammed ram%2:35:00::
his
mind
into
focus
and
said say%2:32:00::
to
the
two
ladies
who
lay lie%2:35:00::
pinkly
nude
beside
him
in
the
desert
,
``
That
was be%2:42:03::
a
good
bite
.
Maybe
I
will
grow grow%2:30:01::
another
head

That
would
make make%2:30:00::
B
'
dikkat
happy

!
The
Lady_Da
forced force%2:38:00::
the
foremost
of
her
bodies
in
an
upright
position
.
Said say%2:32:00::
she
,
``
I
'm be%2:42:03::
strong
,
too

I

Mercer
smiled smile%2:29:00::
at
her
through
his
happiness
.
``
Of_course
you
can
.
But
is be%2:42:03::
n't
this
nice

.
With
this
he
felt feel%2:39:00::
his
lips
thicken thicken%2:30:00::
and
his
mind
go go%2:30:04::
slack
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
wide
awake
,
but
he
did
not
feel_like feel_like%2:37:00::
doing do%2:41:01::
anything
.
In_that
beautiful
place
,
among
all
those
companionable
and
attractive
people
,
he
sat sit%2:35:00::
and
smiled smile%2:29:00::
.
B
'
dikkat
was
sterilizing sterilize%2:29:01::
his
knives
.
Mercer
wondered wonder%2:31:00::
how
long
the
super-condamine
had
lasted last%2:42:00::
him
.
He
endured endure%2:42:04::
the
ministrations
of
the
dromozoa
without
screams
or
movement
.
The
agonies
of
nerves
and
itching
of
skin
were be%2:42:06::
phenomena
which
happened happen%2:30:00::
somewhere
near
him
,
but
meant mean%2:42:00::
nothing
.
He
watched watch%2:39:00::
his
own
body
with
remote
,
casual
interest
.
The
Lady_Da
and
the
hand-covered
woman
stayed stay%2:42:02::
near
him
.
After
a
long_time
the
half-man
dragged drag%2:35:00::
himself
over
to
the
group
with
his
powerful
arms
.
Having
arrived arrive%2:38:00::
he
blinked blink%2:29:00::
sleepily
and
friendlily
at
them
,
and
lapsed lapse%2:38:01::
back
into
the
restful
stupor
from
which
he
had
emerged emerge%2:30:00::
.
Mercer
saw see%2:39:00::
the
sun
rise
on_occasion
,
closed close%2:35:00::
his
eyes
briefly
,
and
opened open%2:35:00::
them
to
see see%2:39:00::
stars
shining shine%2:43:01::
.
Time
had have%2:40:00::
no
meaning
.
The
dromozoa
fed feed%2:34:04::
him
in
their
mysterious
way
;
the
drug
canceled_out cancel_out%2:30:00::
his
needs
for
cycles
of
the
body
.
At_last
he
noticed notice%2:39:00::
a
return
of
the
inwardness
of
pain
.
The
pains
themselves
had
not
changed change%2:30:00::
;
he
had
.
He
knew know%2:31:01::
all
the
events
which
could
take_place take_place%2:30:00::
on
Shayol
.
He
remembered remember%2:31:00::
them
well
from
his
happy
period
.
Formerly
he
had
noticed notice%2:39:04::
them
-
now
he
felt feel%2:37:00::
them
.
He
tried try%2:41:00::
to
ask ask%2:32:00::
the
Lady_Da
how
long
they
had
had have%2:39:06::
the
drug
,
and_how
much
longer
they
would
have have%2:42:05::
to
wait wait%2:42:01::
before
they
had have%2:39:06::
it
again
.
She
smiled smile%2:29:00::
at
him
with
benign
,
remote
happiness
;
apparently
her
many
torsos
,
stretched_out stretch_out%2:38:00::
along
the
ground
,
had have%2:40:00::
a
greater
capacity
for
retaining retain%2:42:00::
the
drug
than
did
his
body
.
She
meant mean%2:31:00::
him
well
,
but
was be%2:42:03::
in
no
condition
for
articulate
speech
.
The
half-man
lay lie%2:35:00::;2:42:00::
on
the
ground
,
arteries
pulsating pulsate%2:38:00::
prettily
behind
the
half-transparent
film
which
protected protect%2:33:00::
his
abdominal_cavity
.
Mercer
squeezed squeeze%2:35:00::
the
man
's
shoulder
.
The
half-man
woke wake%2:29:00::
,
recognized recognize%2:31:00::
Mercer
and
gave give%2:32:00::
him
a
healthily
sleepy
grin

``

``

The

laughed laugh%2:29:00::

close_to

``

Mercer
did
not

what
an

was be%2:42:06::
,
since
he
had
not

a
well-read
man
before
his
conviction
,
but
he
got get%2:30:03::
nothing
more
from
the
half-man
at_that_time
.
The
half-man
received receive%2:39:03::
a
dromozootic
implant
,
turned turn%2:42:00::
red
in
the
face
,
shouted shout%2:32:00::
senselessly
at
Mercer

``

When
Mercer
looked_on look_on%2:39:00::
helplessly
,
the
half-man
twisted twist%2:38:01::
over
on
his
side
,
his
pink
dusty
back
turned turn%2:38:00::
to
Mercer
,
and
wept weep%2:29:00::
hoarsely
and
quietly
to
himself
.
Mercer
himself
could
not
tell tell%2:31:00::
how
long
it
was
before
B

dikkat
came_back come_back%2:38:00::
.
It
might
have
been be%2:42:06::
several

It

several

Once_again
B

dikkat
moved move%2:38:03::
among
them
like
a

;
once_again
they
clustered cluster%2:38:00::
like
children

This
time
B
'
dikkat
smiled smile%2:29:00::
pleasantly
at
the
little
head
which
had
grown grow%2:30:02::
out
of
Mercer
's
thigh
-
a
sleeping
child
's
head
,
covered
with
light
hair
on
top
and
with
dainty
eyebrows
over
the
resting
eyes
.
Mercer
got get%2:30:03::
the
blissful
needle
.
When
B
'
dikkat
cut cut%2:35:00::
the
head
from
Mercer
's
thigh
,
he
felt feel%2:39:00::
the
knife
grinding grind%2:35:02::
against
the
cartilage
which
held hold%2:35:01::
the
head
to
his
own
body
.
He
saw see%2:39:00::
the
child-face
grimace grimace%2:29:00::
as
the
head
was
cut cut%2:35:00::
;
he
felt feel%2:29:00::
the
far
,
cool
flash
of
unimportant
pain
,
as
B
'
dikkat
dabbed dab%2:35:01::
the
wound
with
a
corrosive
antiseptic
which
stopped stop%2:42:00::
all
bleeding
immediately
.
The
next
time
it
was be%2:42:06::
two
legs
growing grow%2:30:02::
from
his
chest
.
Then
there
had
been be%2:42:04::
another
head
beside
his
own
.
Or
was be%2:42:04::
that
after
the
torso
and
legs
,
waist
to
toe-tips
,
of
the
little
girl
which
had
grown grow%2:30:02::
from
his
side
?
He
forgot forget%2:31:00::
the
order
.
He
did
not
count count%2:32:00::
time
.
Lady_Da
smiled smile%2:29:00::
at
him
often
,
but
there
was be%2:42:04::
no
love
in_this_place
.
She
had
lost lose%2:40:02::
the
extra
torsos
.
In_between
teratologies
,
she
was be%2:42:03::
a
pretty
and
shapely
woman
;
but
the
nicest
thing
about
their
relationship
was be%2:42:06::
her
whisper
to
him
,
repeated repeat%2:32:00::
some
thousands
of
time
,
repeated repeat%2:32:00::
with
smiles
and
hope
,
``
People
never
live live%2:42:04::
forever
''
.
She
found find%2:32:01::
this
immensely
comforting
,
even_though
Mercer
did
not
make make_sense%2:42:00::
much
sense
out
of_it
.
Thus
events
occurred occur%2:30:00::
,
and
victims
changed change%2:30:00::
in
appearance
,
and
new
ones
arrived arrive%2:38:00::
.
Sometimes
B
'
dikkat
took take%2:40:00::
the
new
ones
,
resting rest%2:35:00::
in
the
everlasting
sleep
of
their
burned-out
brains
,
in
a
ground-truck
to
be
added add%2:30:00::
to
other
herds
.
The
bodies
in
the
truck
threshed thresh%2:38:00::
and
bawled bawl%2:32:00::
without
human
speech
when
the
dromozoa
struck strike%2:35:00::
them
.
Finally
,
Mercer
did
manage manage%2:41:09::
to
follow follow%2:38:00::
B
'
dikkat
to
the
door
of
the
cabin
.
He
had have%2:42:05::
to
fight fight%2:33:01::
the
bliss
of
super-condamine
to
do_it
.
Only
the
memory
of
previous
hurt
,
bewilderment
and
perplexity
made make%2:30:00::
him
sure
that
if
he
did
not
ask ask%2:32:00::
B
'
dikkat
when
he
,
Mercer
,
was be%2:42:03::
happy
,
the
answer
would
no_longer
be be%2:42:03::
available
when
he
needed need%2:37:00::
it
.
Fighting fight%2:33:01::
pleasure
itself
,
he
begged beg%2:32:00::
B
'
dikkat
to
check check%2:31:00::
the
records
and
to
tell tell%2:32:00::
him
how
long
he
had
been be%2:42:05::
there
.
B
'
dikkat
grudgingly
agreed agree%2:32:01::
,
but
he
did
not
come_out come_out%2:30:00::
of
the
doorway
.
He
spoke speak%2:32:03::
through
the
public
address
box
built build%2:36:00::
into
the
cabin
,
and
his
gigantic
voice
roared roar%2:32:02::
out
over
the
empty
plain
,
so_that
the
pink
herd
of
talking
people
stirred stir%2:38:00::
gently
in
their
happiness
and
wondered wonder%2:31:00::
what
their
friend
B
'
dikkat
might
be
wanting want%2:37:00::
to
tell tell%2:32:04::
them
.
When
he
said say%2:32:00::
it
,
they
thought think%2:31:01::
it
exceedingly
profound
,
though
none
of
them
understood understand%2:31:00::
it
,
since
it
was be%2:42:06::
simply
the
amount_of_time
that

turned_away turn_away%2:38:02::

The
secret
little
corner
of
his

happiness
and

made make%2:32:00::

about

What
kept keep%2:42:00::

without

Mercer
,
despite
his
happiness
,
wept weep%2:29:00::
a_little
at
the
strange
fate
of
B
'
dikkat
.
His
own
fate
he
accepted accept%2:31:01::
.
He
remembered remember%2:31:02::
the
last
time
he
had
eaten eat%2:34:00::
-
actual
eggs
from
an
actual
pan
.
The
dromozoa
kept keep%2:42:00::
him
alive
,
but
he
did
not
know know%2:31:01::
how
they
did
it
.
He
staggered stagger%2:38:00::
back
to
the
group
.
The
Lady_Da
,
naked
in
the
dusty
plain
,
waved wave%2:32:00::
a
hospitable
hand
and
showed show%2:32:01::
that
there
was
a
place
for
him
to
sit sit%2:35:00::
beside
her
.
There
were be%2:42:04::
unclaimed
square_miles
of
seating
space
around
them
,
but
he
appreciated appreciate%2:37:00::
the
kindliness
of
her
gesture
none
the
less
.
The
years
,
if
they
were be%2:42:06::
years
,
went_by go_by%2:38:00::
.
The
land
of
Shayol
did
not
change change%2:30:00::
.
Sometimes
the
bubbling
sound
of
geysers
came come%2:38:00::
faintly
across
the
plain
to
the
herd
of
men
;
those
who
could
talk talk%2:32:00::
declared declare%2:32:04::
it
to
be be%2:42:06::
the
breathing
of
Captain_Alvarez
.
There
was
night
and
day
,
but
no
setting
of
crops
,
no
change
of
season
,
no
generations
of
men
.
Time
stood_still stand_still%2:38:00::
for
these
people
,
and
their
load
of
pleasure
was be%2:42:03::
so
commingled
with
the
shocks
and
pains
of
the
dromozoa
that
the
words
of
the
Lady_Da
took_on take_on%2:30:00::
very
remote
meaning
.
``
People
never
live live%2:42:04::
forever
''
.
Her
statement
was be%2:42:06::
a
hope
,
not
a
truth
in_which
they
could
believe believe%2:31:03::
.
They
did
not
have have%2:40:00::
the
wit
to
follow follow%2:38:01::
the
stars
in
their
courses
,
to
exchange exchange%2:40:00::
names
with
each
other
,
to
harvest harvest%2:35:00::
the
experience
of
each
for
the
wisdom
of
all
.
There
was
no
dream
of
escape
for
these
people
.
Though
they
saw see%2:39:00::
the
old-style
chemical
rockets
lift_up lift_up%2:38:00::
from
the
field
beyond
B
'
dikkat
's
cabin
,
they
did
not
make
plans
to
hide hide%2:39:01::
among
the
frozen
crop
of
transmuted
flesh
.
Far
long_ago
,
some
other
prisoner
than
one
of
these
had
tried try%2:41:00::
to
write write%2:32:00::
a
letter
.
His
handwriting
was be%2:42:05::
on
a
rock
.
Mercer
read read%2:31:00::
it
,
and
so
had
a_few
of
the
others
,
but
they
could
not
tell tell%2:31:00::
which
man
had
done
it
.
Nor
did
they
care care%2:37:02::
.
The
letter
,
scraped scrape%2:36:00::
on
stone
,
had
been be%2:42:06::
a
message
home
.
They
could
still
read read%2:31:00::
the
opening
:
``
Once
,
I
was be%2:42:03::
like
you
,
stepping_out step_out%2:38:00::
of
my
window
at
the
end
of
day
,
and
letting let%2:41:00::
the
winds
blow
me
gently
toward
the
place
I
lived live%2:42:08::
in
.
Once
,
like
you
,
I
had have%2:40:00::
one
head
,
two
hands
,
ten
fingers
on
my
hands
.
The
front
part
of
my
head
was
called call%2:32:02::
a
face
,
and
I
could
talk talk%2:32:00::
with_it
.
Now
I
can
only
write write%2:32:00::
,
and
that
only
when
I
get get%2:30:00::
out
of
pain
.
