The
Momoyama
family
had
come come%2:42:09::
from
Miyagi_Prefecture
,
in
the
northeast
of
the
main
Japanese
island
of
Honshu
,
where
there
are be%2:42:05::
still
traces
of
the
mysterious
Ainu
strain
.
The
Ainus
were be%2:42:03::
a
primitive
people
,
already
living live%2:42:08::
on
the
island
before
the
principal
ancestors
of
the
Japanese
came come%2:38:00::
from
Southern_Asia
.
Apparently
they
were be%2:42:03::
of
Caucasian
blood
.
They
had have%2:40:00::
white
skins
and
blue
eyes
;
all
their
men
were be%2:42:03::
bearded
,
and
many_of
their
women
were be%2:42:03::
beautiful
.
A
pitiful
few
of
them
are be%2:42:03::
left
now
,
to
subsist subsist%2:42:00::
mainly
on
the
tourist
trade
and
to
sing sing%2:36:01::
their
ancient
tribal
chants
,
which
have have%2:40:00::
the
same
haunting
sadness
as
the
laments
of
the
American_Indians
.
Most_of
them
have
been
assimilated assimilate%2:30:00::
,
but
sometimes
a
man
in
Miyagi
or
Akita
prefectures
is be%2:42:03::
much
more
hairy
than
the
average
Japanese
,
and
occasionally
a
girl
will
be be%2:42:03::
strikingly
lovely
,
her
coloring
warmed warm%2:30:00::
and
improved improve%2:30:01::
by
a_little
of
the
tawny
honey-in-the-sun
tint
of
the
invaders
from
the
South
.
Tommy_Momoyama
was be%2:42:06::
one
of
these
fortunate
occasions
.
She
was be%2:42:03::
taller
than
most
Japanese
girls
,
and
had have%2:40:00::
the
exquisitely
willowy
form
of
the
Japanese
girl
who
is be%2:42:03::
lucky
enough
to
be be%2:42:03::
tall
.
Her
nose
was be%2:42:03::
higher
of
bridge
,
her
complexion
so
pale
as
to
be be%2:42:03::
quite
susceptible_to
sunburn
,
and
the
fish
and
vegetable
diet
of
her
forebears
had
given give%2:40:03::
her
teeth
that
were be%2:42:03::
white
and
regular
and
strong
.
Her
mouth
,
soft
and
full
,
was be%2:42:03::
something
for
any
man
to
dream dream%2:36:00::
about
.
She
had have%2:40:00::
black_eyes
,
long
and
intriguingly
tilted
,
and
the
way
she
walked walk%2:38:00::
was be%2:42:06::
melody
.
She
had
been be%2:42:04::
in
Japan
just
one
week
.
It
was be%2:42:06::
an
alien
land
,
and
she
hated hate%2:37:00::
it
intensely
;
she
was
already
considering consider%2:31:00::
putting_in put_in%2:33:00::
rebellious
requests
for
duty
at
San_Diego
,
Bremerton
,
the
Great_Lakes
,
Pensacola
-
any
place
the
Navy
had have%2:42:00::
a
hospital
-
with
a
threat
to
resign resign%2:41:00::
her
commission
if
the
request
were
not
granted grant%2:40:03::
.
Anywhere
would
be be%2:42:03::
better
than
the
land
of
her
ancestors
.
There
was
nothing
wrong
with
her
job
.
Tommy
had
been
assigned assign%2:41:00::
to
the
psychopathic
ward
.
There
were be%2:42:04::
no
depressingly
serious
cases
:
the
ward
doctor
sometimes
teamed_up team_up%2:33:00::
with
the
chaplain
to
serve serve%2:42:03::
as
a
marriage
counselor
-
sometimes
the
Navy
sent send%2:38:01::
people
back
to
the
States
to
preserve preserve%2:42:00::
a
marriage
-
but
mental_health
as
a
rule
was be%2:42:03::
very
high
.
At_present
the
doctor
's
main
concern
was be%2:42:06::
in
seeing_to_it see_to_it%2:31:00::
that
Japanese
salvage
firms
were
not
permitted permit%2:32:00::
to
operate operate%2:41:00::
on
the
hulks
of
warships
sunk sink%2:38:01::
too_close
inshore
,
because
the
work
involved involve%2:42:07::
setting_off set_off%2:30:00::
nerve-shattering
blasts
at_all
hours
.
Tommy
was be%2:42:03::
interested
in
psychiatry
,
because
there
was
much
an
understanding
nurse
could
do
to
help help%2:29:00::
the
patients
.
But
she
suffered suffer%2:37:00::
in
her
off-duty
hours
.
Such_as
now
,
when
she
sat sit%2:35:00::
at
a
table
in
the
coffee_shop
at
the
Officers
'
Club
,
having have%2:34:00::
coffee
and
a
hamburger
to
sustain sustain%2:42:01::
her
until
dinnertime
.
She
had
changed change%2:30:03::
into
a
cocktail_dress
,
and
the
whole
evening
should
have
been be%2:42:03::
before
her
,
but
already
she
was
beginning begin%2:30:00::
to
get get%2:39:00::
a
tight
feeling
at
the
back
of
her
neck
.
This
was be%2:42:06::
one
of
the
Navy
's
crossroads
-
you
find find%2:40:02::
them
all_around
the
world
.
Ships
from
the
West_Coast
rotated rotate%2:41:00::
on
six-month
tours_of_duty
with
the
Seventh_Fleet
,
and
Yokosuka
was be%2:42:06::
the
Seventh_Fleet
's
principal
port
for
maintenance
,
upkeep
and
shore
liberty
.
Sooner_or_later
,
all
the
gray
Navy
ships
came_in come_in%2:38:02::
here
;
if
Tommy
sat sit%2:35:00::
long
enough
,
she
would
be be%2:42:03::
sure
to
see see%2:39:00::
all
the
young
officers
she
had
met meet%2:38:01::
in
San_Diego
and
Long_Beach
.
And
she
wanted want%2:37:00::
desperately
to
see see%2:39:00::
someone
she
had
known know%2:31:00::
back
there
.
She
felt feel%2:37:00::
,
rather_than
saw see%2:39:00::
,
the
approach
of
the
good-looking
young_man
.
He
came_through come_through%2:30:00::
from
the
Fleet_Bar
,
which
was be%2:42:03::
stag
,
with
the
ice_cubes
tinkling tinkle%2:39:00::
in
a
glass
he
carried carry%2:35:02::
.
When
he
saw see%2:39:00::
Tommy
sitting sit%2:35:00::
alone
,
the
tinkling
sound
stopped stop%2:42:00::
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
perhaps
a_trifle
tipsy
,
having
been be%2:42:05::
long
at_sea
where
drinking
is
not
permitted permit%2:32:00::
,
and
consequently
out_of_practice
;
he
wore wear%2:29:00::
a
brown
tweed
sports_jacket
obviously
tailored tailor%2:36:01::
in
Hong_Kong
,
and
he
was be%2:42:03::
of
an
age
that
marked mark%2:31:09::
him
as
a
lieutenant
.
Probably
off
one
of
the
carriers
-
an
aviator
.
There
was be%2:42:07::
a
fifty-fifty
chance
,
perhaps
,
that
he
would
be be%2:42:03::
unmarried
,
and
an
even
more
slender
chance
that
his
approach
would
be be%2:42:03::
different
.
Japan
did do%2:36:02::
something
to_a_man
-
and
it
was be%2:42:06::
n't
just
Japan
,
either
,
because
the
same
thing
applied apply%2:42:00::
anywhere
overseas
.
It
was be%2:42:06::
as
if
foreign
duty
implied imply%2:32:01::
and
excused excuse%2:32:03::
license
;
it
intimated intimate%2:32:01::
that
the
folks
at_home
would
never
know know%2:31:01::
about
it
,
and
,
therefore
,
why
not
?
Then
the
young_man
in
the
brown
sports_jacket
spoke speak%2:32:00::
,
and
it
was be%2:42:03::
no
different
.
``
Harro
,
girl-san
''
!
he
said say%2:32:00::
,
turning_on turn_on%2:39:00::
what
was
meant mean%2:31:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
charm
.
``
You
catchee
boy-furiendo
?
Maybe
you
likee like%2:37:05::
date
with
me
''
?
``
I
beg_your_pardon
''
!
Tommy
said say%2:32:00::
out
of
her
cold
rage
.
``
I
do
n't
believe believe%2:31:04::
I
know know%2:31:01::
you
,
and
I
can
n't
understand understand%2:31:00::
your
quaint
brand
of
English
-
it
was
meant mean%2:31:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
English
,
was
n't
it
''
?
The
nice-looking
young
officer
fell_back fall_back%2:38:01::
on
his
heels
,
open-mouthed
and
blushing
.
At_least
,
he
had have%2:40:00::
the
decency
to
blush blush%2:29:00::
,
she
thought think%2:31:01::
.
``
Oh
-
I
'm be%2:42:03::
sorry
!
You
see see%2:31:01::
,
I
thought think%2:31:01::
-
I
mean mean%2:32:01::
I
really
had have%2:40:00::
no
idea
''
-
``
Oh
,
yes
-
you
had have%2:40:00::
ideas
''
!
Tommy
interrupted interrupt%2:30:03::
furiously
.
``
All
wrong
ones
''
!
Then
she
jerked jerk%2:35:01::
her
thumb
toward
the
door
in
a
very
American
gesture
,
and
dropped drop%2:32:00::
into
Navy
slang
.
``
Take_off take_off%2:38:00::
,
fly-boy
''
!
``
Uh
-
sorry
''
!
he
muttered mutter%2:32:01::
,
and
took_off take_off%2:38:00::
,
obviously
feeling feel%2:31:01::
like
a
fool
.
The
trouble
was be%2:42:06::
that
there
was
no
lasting
satisfaction
in_this
for
Tommy
.
She
felt feel%2:31:01::
like
a
fool
,
too
.
It
had
n't
been be%2:42:03::
this
way
in
college
,
or
in
nurses
'
training
;
it
was be%2:42:03::
n't
this
way
in
the
hospital
at
San_Diego
.
Everybody
had
accepted accept%2:40:00::
her
for
what
she
was be%2:42:06::
-
a
very
charming
girl
.
Nobody
had
addressed address%2:32:02::
her
in
broken
English
at
any
of
those
places
,
nobody
had
suggested suggest%2:32:04::
that
she
was be%2:42:03::
n't
American
.
There
are
Spanish
girls
who
look_like look_like%2:42:00::
Tommy_Momoyama
,
brunettes
with
a
Moorish
hint
of
the
Orient
in
their
faces
;
there
are
beauties
from
the
Balkan_states
who
are be%2:42:03::
similarly
endowed
,
and
-
back
in
the
blessed
United_States
-
they
were
regarded regard%2:31:00::
simply
as
pretty
women
.
Now
,
having
been
sent send%2:38:01::
halfway
around
the
world
on
a
job
she
had
not
asked ask%2:32:01::
for
,
Tommy
was
being
humiliated humiliate%2:37:00::
at
every
turn
.
She
looked_around look_around%2:39:00::
,
self-consciously
.
Four
little
Japanese
waitresses
were
murdering murder%2:30:00::
the_English
language
at
the
counter
-
Yuki_Kobayashi
happened happen%2:41:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
one
of
them
.
Everybody
but
Tommy
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
think think%2:31:01::
it
was be%2:42:03::
charming
when
they
called call%2:32:09::
,
``
Bifutek-san
''
!
for
a
steak
sandwich
,
or
``
Kohi
futotsu
''
!
for
one
cup
of
coffee
.
Two
other
Japanese
girls
were
sitting sit%2:35:00::
at
the
tables
,
both
quite
pretty
and
well
groomed
.
One
was be%2:42:04::
with
a
whitehaired
and
doting
lieutenant_commander
;
the
other
was be%2:42:04::
with
her
American
husband
and
their
exceptionally
appealing
children
.
Seeing see%2:39:00::
these
did_nothing
for
Tommy
's
mood
.
She
told tell%2:32:04::
herself
rebelliously
,
and
with_pride
,
I
am be%2:42:03::
an
American
!
And
so
she
was be%2:42:03::
,
and
would
remain remain%2:30:00::
.
But
she
was
learning learn%2:31:01::
that
so_long
as
she
was be%2:42:04::
in_this
country
,
and
wore wear%2:29:00::
civilian_dress
in
the
Club
,
there
would
always
be be%2:42:04::
transient
young_men
who
would
approach approach%2:32:00::
her
with
broken
English
.
There
had
been be%2:42:04::
occasions
when
some
of
the
more
experienced
had
even
addressed address%2:32:00::
her
in_what
might
have
been be%2:42:06::
perfectly
good
Japanese
.
Tommy
would
n't
know know%2:31:01::
;
after
coming come%2:38:04::
to
America
,
her
parents
had
spoken speak%2:32:02::
only
English
.
One
thing
was
becoming become%2:30:00::
increasingly
sure
.
She
had
been
sent send%2:38:01::
to
the
wrong
place
for
duty
.
There
was be%2:42:03::
more
to
service
in
the
Navy_Nurse_Corps
than
the
hours
in
the
ward
.
One
had_to
have have%2:40:00::
friends
,
and
a
congenial
life
in
after-duty
hours
.
Now
there
was be%2:42:04::
raucous
male
singing
from
the
Fleet_Bar
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
terribly
off
key
,
and
poorly
done do%2:41:01::
,
and
Tommy
could
never
admit admit%2:32:00::
to
herself
that
male
companionship
was be%2:42:03::
a
very
natural
and
important
thing
,
but
all_at_once
she
felt feel%2:37:00::
lonesome
and
put-upon
.
She
finished finish%2:34:00::
her
hamburger
and
drank drink%2:34:00::
her
coffee
and
paid pay%2:40:00::
her
check
;
she
got_out get_out%2:38:01::
of
the
coffee_shop
before
the
incident
could
be
repeated repeat%2:30:00::
.
Eating
while
angry
had
given give%2:40:03::
her
a
slight
indigestion
.
Back
in
her
living_quarters
at
the
hospital
she
took take%2:34:00::
bicarbonate_of_soda
,
and
sulked sulk%2:37:00::
.
Then
,
after
a
while
,
she
went go%2:38:00::
to
her
mirror
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
all
true
.
She
certainly
looked look%2:39:01::
Japanese
,
and
perhaps
she
could
not
really
blame blame%2:32:00::
the
young_men
.
And
,
still
,
they
did
not
have_to
be be%2:42:03::
so
crude
in
their
approach
.
There
was
a
letter
to
write write%2:32:00::
to
her
mother
,
and
she
tried try%2:41:00::
to
make make%2:30:00::
its
tone
cheerful
.
She
promised promise%2:32:00::
that
she
would
soon
take take%2:40:06::
a_few
day
's
leave
and
visit visit%2:41:00::
the
uncle
she
had
never
seen see%2:39:00::
,
on
the
island
of
Oyajima
-
which
was be%2:42:03::
not
very
far
from
Yokusuka
.
And
tomorrow
she
would
take take%2:40:06::
time
to
shop shop%2:40:00::
for
the
kimono
her
mother
wanted want%2:37:00::
to
present present%2:40:00::
to
the
young
wife
of
a
faculty_member
as
a
hostess
gown
.
Tommy
,
of_course
,
had
never
heard hear%2:31:00::
of
a
kotowaza
,
or
Japanese
proverb
,
which
says say%2:32:00::
,
``
Tanin
yori
miuchi
''
,
and
is
literally
translated translate%2:32:00::
as
``
Relatives
are be%2:42:03::
better
than
strangers
''
.
Actually
,
this
is be%2:42:06::
only
another
way
of
saying say%2:32:00::
that
blood
is be%2:42:03::
thicker
than
water
.
Doc_Doolittle
's
scheduled
appearance
at
captain
's
mast
was be%2:42:03::
a
very
unusual
thing
,
because
the
discipline
dispensed dispense%2:40:00::
there
is be%2:42:03::
ordinarily
for
the
young
and
immature
,
and
a
chief
is be%2:42:03::
naturally
expected expect%2:31:00::
to
stay stay%2:30:00::
off
the
report
.
But
the
beer
hall
riot
in
Subic
had
been be%2:42:03::
unusual
,
too
,
and
Walt_Perry
was be%2:42:03::
convinced
that
Doc
had
started start%2:30:01::
it
through
some
expert
tactics
in
rabble
rousing
.
Just
why
anybody
should
wish wish%2:37:00::
to
start start%2:30:01::
a
riot
the
executive_officer
did
n't
know know%2:31:01::
.
In
his
opinion
,
Doc
had
not
grown_up grow_up%2:41:00::
.
The
lieutenant
was be%2:42:03::
not
entirely
wrong
in
the
belief
.
There
had
never
been be%2:42:00::
a
good
reason
for
Doc_Doolittle
to
grow_up grow_up%2:41:00::
.
He
had
come come%2:38:04::
into
the
Navy
too
young
,
with
the
image
of
the
fun-loving
Guns
Appleby
before
him
.
