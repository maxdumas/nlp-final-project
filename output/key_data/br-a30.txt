feels feel%2:31:00::
she
is be%2:42:03::
on
the
threshold
of
a
whole
new
life
in
Los_Angeles
.
Her
days
as
an
art_student
at
the
University
of
Budapest
came come%2:30:03::
to
a
sudden
end
during
the
Hungarian
uprisings

there
she
had have%2:42:00::
her
first

There
's
a_lot_of
talk
about
the
problem
of
education
in
America
today
.
What
most
people
do
n't
seem
to
realize realize%2:31:01::
,
if
they
are
n't
tied_up
with
the
thing
as
I
am
,
is be%2:42:03::
that
90
%
of
the
problem
is be%2:42:07::
transportation
.
I
never
dreamed dream%2:36:00::
of
the
logistical
difficulties
involved
until
,
at_long_last
,
both
of
my
boys
got
squeezed squeeze%2:35:05::
into
high_school
.
It
seems seem%2:39:01::
like
only
last
year
that
we
watched watch%2:39:05::
them
set_out set_out%2:38:00::
up
the
hill
hand_in_hand
on
a
rainy_day
in
their
yellow
raincoats
to
finger-paint fingerpaint%2:36:00::
at
the
grammar_school
.
Getting get%2:38:00::
to
and
from
school
was be%2:42:03::
no
problem
.
They
either
walked walk%2:38:00::
or
were
driven drive%2:38:02::
.
Now
they
go_to go_to%2:42:00::
a
high_school
that
is be%2:42:03::
two
miles
away
.
One
might
think think%2:31:03::
the
problem
would
be be%2:42:03::
similar
.
They
could
walk walk%2:38:00::
,
ride ride%2:38:00::
on
a
bus
or
be
driven drive%2:38:02::
.
It
's
much
more
complex
than
that
.
Generally
,
they
go_to go_to%2:42:00::
school
with
a
girl
named name%2:32:03::
Gloriana
,
who
lives live%2:42:08::
down
the
block
,
and
has have%2:40:04::
a
car
.
This
is be%2:42:07::
a
way
of
getting get%2:38:00::
to
school
,
but
,
I
understand understand%2:31:01::
,
it
entails entail%2:42:00::
a
certain
loss
of
social_status
.
A
young_man
does
n't
like
to
be
driven drive%2:38:02::
up
in_front
of
a
school
in
a
car
driven drive%2:38:01::
by
a
girl
who
is be%2:42:03::
n't
even
in
a
higher
class
than
he
is be%2:42:03::
,
and
is be%2:42:07::
also
a
girl
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
walk walk%2:38:00::
to
school
then
''
?
I
suggested suggest%2:32:03::
.
``
My
father
walked walk%2:38:00::
,
through
two
miles
of
snow
,
in
Illinois
''
.
``
Did
you
''
?
I
was
asked ask%2:32:00::
.
``
No
''
,
I
said say%2:32:00::
,
``
I
did
n't
happen happen%2:30:02::
to
grow_up grow_up%2:41:00::
in
Illinois
''
.
I
explained explain%2:32:00::
,
however
,
that
I
had have%2:40:00::
my
share
of
hardship
in
making make%2:41:00::
my
daily
pilgrimage
to
the
feet
of
wisdom
.
I
had
to
ride ride%2:38:00::
a
streetcar
two
miles
.
Sometimes
the
streetcar
was be%2:42:03::
late
.
Sometimes
there
were be%2:42:00::
n't
even
any
seats
.
I
had
to
stand_up stand_up%2:35:00::
,
with
the
ladies
.
Sometimes
I
got_on get_on%2:38:03::
the
wrong
car
and
did
n't
get get%2:38:00::
to
school
at_all
,
but
wound_up wind_up%2:30:02::
at
the
ocean
,
or
some
other
dismal
place
,
and
had_to
spend spend%2:42:00::
the
day
there
.
I
've
tried try%2:41:00::
to
compromise compromise%2:32:00::
by
letting let%2:41:00::
them
take take%2:38:02::
the
little
car
now_and_then
.
When
they
do do%2:41:01::
that
my
wife
has
to
drive drive%2:38:00::
me
to
work
in
the
big
car
.
She
has
to
have have%2:40:04::
at_least
one
car
herself
.
I
feel feel%2:37:00::
a
certain
loss
of
status
when
I
am
driven drive%2:38:02::
up
in_front
of
work
in
a
car
driven drive%2:38:01::
by
my
wife
,
who
is be%2:42:07::
only
a
woman
.
Even
that
is be%2:42:03::
n't
satisfactory
.
If
they
have
to
take take%2:38:02::
any
car
,
they
'd
rather
take take%2:38:02::
the
big
one
.
They
say say%2:32:00::
that
when
they
take take%2:38:02::
a
car
,
Gloriana
does
n't
take take%2:38:02::
her
car
,
but
rides ride%2:38:00::
with
them
.
But
when
Gloriana
rides ride%2:38:00::
with
them
they
also
have
to
take take%2:38:09::
the
two
girls
who
usually
ride ride%2:38:00::
with
her
,
so
the
little
car
is be%2:42:03::
n't
big
enough
.
The
logic
of_that
is be%2:42:03::
impeccable
,
of_course
,
except
that
I
feel feel%2:37:00::
like
a
fool
being
driven drive%2:38:02::
up_to
work
in
a_little
car
,
by
my
wife
,
when
everybody
knows know%2:31:01::
I
have have%2:40:04::
a
big
car
and
am be%2:42:03::
capable_of
driving
myself
.
The
solution
,
naturally
,
is be%2:42:07::
the
bus
.
However
,
it
's
a
half-mile
walk
down
a
steep
hill
from
our
house
to
the
bus
,
and
it
's
too
hard
on
my
legs
.
My
wife
could
drive drive%2:38:01::
us
down
the
hill
and
we
could
all
walk walk%2:38:00::
from
there
.
But
that
's
hardly
realistic
.
Nobody
walks walk%2:38:00::
any_more
but
crackpots
and
Harry_Truman
,
and
he
's
already
got get%2:40:00::
an
education
.
