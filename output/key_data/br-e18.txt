This

described describe%2:32:00::
by

president
of

in
his
``
Travels
in
New-England

,
published publish%2:36:01::
in

He
says say%2:32:00::
of_it
:
``
It
consists_of consist_of%2:42:00::
two
divisions

separated separate%2:42:00::

The

of

it

above

In

I
have
already

that
Mr._Timothy_Palmer

the
inventor

the
arched

had
never

a
structure
of_this
nature

he
certainly
deserves deserve%2:42:00::
not
a_little
credit

the
invention

.
It
is be%2:42:03::
hardly
necessary
to
remind remind%2:31:00::
students

covered
bridges
that
Timothy_Palmer
was_born be_born%2:30:00::
in

that

was be%2:42:03::
sixteen
years
old
;
and
was_there
apprenticed apprentice%2:31:00::
to
a
builder
and
architect
,
Moody_Spofford

It
was be%2:42:03::
indeed
a
remarkable
feat
that
a
man
who
had
had have%2:40:00::
no
experience
of
bridge
building
should
have
applied apply%2:34:00::
the
principle
of
the
arch

which
appears appear%2:39:01::
in
his
famous
bridges
at

As
far
as
we
know know%2:31:01::
,
no
American
bridge
had
been
thus
protected protect%2:33:00::
in
1792

Richard_S._Allen
is be%2:42:06::
the
authority
for
the
statement
that
the
northern
section
was
probably
roofed roof%2:35:00::
by

Its
original
appearance
is_shown

engraving
published publish%2:36:01::

in

herewith
(

A
brief
description
accompanying accompany%2:42:00::
the
picture
says say%2:42:00::
that
the
bridge
contained contain%2:42:00::
more_than
6000
tons
of
timber
.
Between
the
abutments
on
the
Newbury
shore
and
the
south
bank
of
Deer_Island
there
was be%2:42:05::
one
span
or
arch
measuring measure%2:42:00::
160
feet
;
between
the
north
shore
of
Deer_Island
and
the
Salisbury
side
there
was be%2:42:05::
an
arch
of
113
feet
and
a
series
of
piers
with
a
draw
forty
feet
long
.
A
dinner
and
celebration
in
honor
of_this
piece
of
engineering
took_place take_place%2:30:00::
July
4
,
1793
,
in
a
tavern
erected erect%2:36:00::
by
the
corporation
on
the
island
.
It
is
said say%2:32:01::
that
the
eccentric
Timothy_Dexter
,
who
was be%2:42:06::
one
of
the
first
share-holders
,
stood stand%2:35:00::
on
the
table
and
made
a
speech
worthy
of
the
occasion
.
The
``
Essex_Journal
''
says say%2:42:00::
that
he
``
delivered deliver%2:32:00::
an
oration
on
the
bridge
,
which
for
elegance
of
style
,
propriety
of
speech
or
force
of
argument
,
was be%2:42:03::
truly
Ciceronian
''
.
The
reporter
must
have
written write%2:36:02::
this
with
tongue
in
cheek
,
because
Dexter
's
oration
could
hardly
be_understood
;
and
,
although
he
later
explained explain%2:32:00::
that
he
was
talking talk%2:32:03::
French
,
it
seems seem%2:39:00::
rather
more
likely
that
he
had
succumbed succumb%2:32:00::
to
the
joys
of
the
evening
.
The
north
portion
of
the
Essex
bridge
was be%2:42:03::
well
worth
the
cost
of
construction
,
although
it
proved prove%2:42:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
twice
what
was
estimated estimate%2:31:01::
in_the_beginning

It
stood stand%2:42:03::
in
its

form
until
1882

The
southern
half
,
however
,
on
account
of
its
underbracing
,
was
considered consider%2:31:00::
by
boat
owners
a
menace

navigation

In
1810
