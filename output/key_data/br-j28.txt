because

also
seems seem%2:39:00::
inadequate
as
an
explanation
for
the

reasons
:
(

)
the
subjects
'
apparently
genuine
experience
of
surprise
when
their

rose rise%2:38:00::
,
and
(

manifestations

despite

happening happen%2:30:00::
(

and
maybe
falling fall%2:38:03::
,
an
expectation
spontaneously
volunteered volunteer%2:32:00::
by
one
of
the

)
.
A
suggestion
hypothesis
also
seems seem%2:39:00::
inadequate
as
an
explanation
for
those
who
shifted shift%2:30:00::
their
reactions
after
they
were
informed inform%2:32:00::
of
the
possibilities
of
``
normal

reactions
different
from
those
which
they
gave give%2:40:05::
.
While
they
were
told tell%2:32:04::
that
there
were
some
normal
people
who
reacted react%2:31:00::
differently

they
were

informed inform%2:32:00::
that
there
were
other
normals
who
reacted react%2:31:00::
as
they
had
.
There
was
no
implication
made make%2:41:00::
that
their
initial
reaction
(
absence
of
an
arm-elevation
)
was be%2:42:03::
less
preferred
than
the
presence
of
levitation
.
A
more
tenable
explanation
for
the
change
in
reactions
is be%2:42:03::
that
the
added
knowledge
and
increased
familiarity
with
the
total
situation
made make%2:36:00::
it
possible
for
these
subjects
to
be be%2:42:03::
less
guarded
and
to
relax relax%2:29:00::
,
since
any
reaction

be

an
inhibiting

They

While

Alcohol

succeeded succeed%2:41:00::
in
changing change%2:30:01::

quite
strikingly
in
one
pilot
subject
(
the
only

This
subject

who
has

psychoanalytic
psychotherapy

did

sober

After
two
drinks
containing contain%2:42:00::
alcohol
,
her
arm
flew fly%2:38:02::
upward
very
freely
.
There
was be%2:42:04::
evident
delight
on
the
part
of
the
subject
in
response
to
her
experience
of
the
freedom
of
movement
.
She
described describe%2:32:00::
herself
as
having have%2:40:00::
the
same
kind_of
``
irresponsible

feeling
as
she
had
once
experienced experience%2:39:00::
under

She
ascribed ascribe%2:31:00::
her
delight
with
both
experiences
to
the
effect
they
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
have have%2:40:00::
of

even
when
it
might
seem seem%2:39:00::
appropriate
to
relax relax%2:30:01::
these
controls
.
Many
subjects
attributed attribute%2:31:00::
differences
in
Kohnstamm
reactivity
to
differences
in
degrees
of
subjective
control
-
voluntary
as
the
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
perceived perceive%2:39:00::
it
and
involuntary
as
the
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
perceived perceive%2:39:00::
it
.
These
suggested
interpretations
were
given give%2:40:05::
by
the
subjects
spontaneously
when
they
were
told tell%2:32:04::
that
there
were
people
who
reacted react%2:31:00::
differently
than
they
had

The
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
described describe%2:32:00::
the
vivid
experience
of
having have%2:40:00::
their
arms
rise rise%2:38:00::
as
one
in_which
they
exercised exercise%2:34:00::
no
control
.
They
explained explain%2:32:00::
its
absence
in
others
on
the
basis
of
an
intervention
of
control
factors
.
They
felt feel%2:31:00::
that
they
too
could
counteract counteract%2:41:00::
the
upward
arm
movement
by
a
voluntary
effort
after
they
had
once
experienced experience%2:39:01::
the
reaction
.
Some
of
those
who
did
not
initially
react react%2:31:00::
with
an
arm-elevation
also
associated associate%2:31:00::
their
behavior
in
the
situation
with
control
factors
-
an
inability
to
relinquish relinquish%2:40:01::
control
voluntarily
.
One
subject
spontaneously
asked ask%2:32:00::
(
after
her
arm
had
finally
risen rise%2:38:00::
)
,
``
Do

?
Another
said say%2:32:00::
that

``

.
This
subject
was be%2:42:03::
one
who
gave give%2:40:05::
an
arm-elevation
on
the
second
trial
in
the
nai
^
ve
state
but
not
in
the
first
.
She
had
felt feel%2:31:00::
that
her
arm
wanted want%2:37:00::
to
go_up go_up%2:38:00::
in
the
first
trial
,
but
had
consciously
prevented prevent%2:41:01::
it
from
so
doing do%2:41:01::
.
She
explained explain%2:32:00::
nonreactivity
of
others
by
saying say%2:32:00::
that
they
were
``
not
letting let%2:41:00::
themselves
relax relax%2:29:00::
''
.
When
informed inform%2:32:00::
that
there
were
some
persons
who
did
not
have have%2:39:06::
their
arm
go_up go_up%2:38:00::
,
she
commented comment%2:32:00::
,
``
I
do
n't
see see%2:31:01::
how
they
can
prevent prevent%2:41:01::
it
''
.
In
contrast
to
this
voluntary-control
explanation
for
nonreactivity
given give%2:40:07::
by
the
Kohnstamm-positive
subjects
,
the
Kohnstamm-negative
subjects
offered offer%2:31:00::
an
involuntary-control
hypothesis
to
explain explain%2:32:00::
nonreactivity
.
They
felt feel%2:31:00::
that
they
were
relaxing relax%2:29:00::
as
much_as
they
could
and
that
any
control
factors
which
might
be be%2:42:03::
present
to
prevent prevent%2:41:01::
response
must
be be%2:42:05::
on
an
unconscious
level
.
The
above
discussion
does
not
mean mean%2:32:01::
to
imply imply%2:32:01::
that
control
factors
were be%2:42:03::
completely
in_abeyance

but
rather
that
they
could
be
diminished diminish%2:30:00::
sufficiently
not
to

with

.
One
Kohnstamm-positive
subject
who
had have%2:40:00::
both
arms
rise rise%2:38:00::
while
being
tested test%2:41:00::
in

described describe%2:32:00::

it

think think%2:31:03::
maybe
that

.
She
then
described describe%2:32:00::
her

as

first
had have%2:40:00::

to

freer

There

They

They
