symbolized symbolize%2:32:00::
so_much

unpleasant

the
indifference

sympathy

birth
was be%2:42:03::
no

Night

he
stayed stay%2:42:01::

rubbing rub%2:35:00::

Yet
when

he
had

was be%2:42:03::

to
see see%2:41:12::
them
once
,
left leave%2:40:01::
silver
teething_rings
for
all_of
the
trips
.
But
when
Miss_Jen
went go%2:38:00::
over
right_away
to
return return%2:40:08::
the
call
,
Miss_Kiz
could
n't
have
been be%2:42:03::
very
cordial
,
for
she
'd
come_back come_back%2:38:00::
before
she
hardly
had have%2:40:01::
time
to
get get%2:38:00::
there
.
More_and_more
,
these
days
,
she
'd
been
driving drive%2:38:02::
that
pretty
little
mare
that
looked_like look_like%2:42:00::
her
,
over
to
Tillie
's
and
Nick
's
-
his
own
old
square
frame
box
on
posts
,
chickens
and
cats
and
pups
under
the
house
,
everybody
friendly
inside
,
making make%2:36:00::
a
to-do
over
the
babies
dressed
like
dollies
.
Though
he
was be%2:42:03::
glad
she
got_on get_on%2:41:00::
well
with
his
young
folks
,
she
ought ought%2:42:01::
to
be be%2:42:03::
welcome
at
the
finest
house
in
the
land
,
too
.
It
made make%2:30:00::
him
pretty
hot_under_the_collar
,
after
the
idea
Miss_Sis
had
given give%2:32:02::
him
,
to
be
told tell%2:32:00::
by
Miss_Kiz
that
her
holy
spa
was be%2:42:03::
all
reserved
for
this
summer
and
next
,
if
you
please
,
and
that_much
as
she
regretted regret%2:37:00::
it
,
they
would
be be%2:42:03::
unable
to
entertain entertain%2:41:00::
Mrs._Robards
and
the
children
.
She
hoped hope%2:37:00::
they
were_well be_well%2:29:00::
.
He
did
n't
tell tell%2:32:00::
Miss_Jen
,
but
she
must
have
got_word get_word%2:31:00::
from
the
cook
or
nurse
,
who
of_course
knew know%2:31:03::
those
Quinzaine
nigs
,
and
she
really
took
a
fit
.
If
he
ever
did do%2:36:01::
such
a
thing
again
she
'd
die die%2:30:00::
of
shame

Miss_Jen

He
was be%2:42:03::
downright
worried
about
her
,
but
there
was
one
more
thing
he
could
try try%2:41:00::
.
Zion
was be%2:42:03::
surprised
when
Roy
's
buggy
stopped stop%2:38:00::
beside
her
on
the
pike
one
early
summer
day
as
she
was
walking walk%2:38:00::
home
from
the
country
school

she
was
teaching teach%2:32:00::
now
that
Eph_Showers

a
call

Roy
smiled smile%2:29:00::

he
did

a
nice
smile
-
took_off take_off%2:35:01::
his
hat
most
politely
,
told tell%2:32:02::
her
to
hop hop%2:38:00::
in
,
and
he
'd
give give%2:40:00::
her
a
lift
to
Quinzaine
.
Her
hesitation
was be%2:42:03::
only
momentary
and
she
hoped hope%2:37:01::
he
did
n't
notice notice%2:39:04::
it
,
as
she
settled settle%2:38:01::
herself
,
asked ask%2:32:00::
quickly
how
Miss_Jenny
and
the
babies
were
getting_on get_on%2:41:00::

``

swung swing%2:38:02::
in
through
his
