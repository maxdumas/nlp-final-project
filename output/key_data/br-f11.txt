it

Occlusion
is be%2:42:06::

expression
for
the
way
teeth

together
when
the

are be%2:42:03::
closed

Malocclusion
,
or
a
bad
fit
,
is be%2:42:06::
what
parents
need_to
look_out look_out%2:39:00::
for
.
One
main
type
of
malocclusion
is
characterized characterize%2:42:01::
by
a
receding
chin
and
protruding
upper
front_teeth
.
A
chin
too
prominent
in_relation_to
the
rest

face

a
thrusting thrust%2:38:00::

an
overdeveloped
lower
jawbone
,
and
an
underdeveloped
upper_jaw
indicate indicate%2:32:01::
the
opposite
type
of
malocclusion
.
These
two
basic
malformations
have have%2:40:00::
,
of_course
,
many
variations
.
A
child
probably
requires require%2:34:00::
some
form
of
treatment
if
he
has have%2:40:00::
any
of
the
following
conditions
:
A
noticeable
protrusion
of
the
upper
or
lower_jaw
.
Crooked
,
overlapping
,
twisted
,
or
widely_spaced
teeth
.
Front_teeth
not

before
the
first
ones
have
fallen fall%2:38:03::
out
,
making make%2:36:00::
a
double
row
.
Contrary
to
the
thinking
of
30
to
40
years
ago
,
when
all
malocclusion
was
blamed blame%2:32:00::
on
some
unfortunate
habit
,
recent
studies
show show%2:31:00::
that
most
tooth
irregularity
has have%2:40:00::
at_least
its
beginning
in
hereditary
predisposition
.
However
,
this
does
not
mean mean%2:42:00::
that
a
child
's
teeth
or
jaws
must
necessarily
resemble resemble%2:42:00::
those
of
someone
in
his
family
.
Tooth
deformity
may
be be%2:42:03::
the
result
of
excessive
thumb
-
or
finger-sucking
,
tongue-thrusting
,
or
lip-sucking
-
but
it
's be%2:42:03::
important
to
remember remember%2:31:01::
that
there
's
a
difference
between
normal
and
excessive
sucking
habits
.
It
's
perfectly
normal
for
babies
to
suck suck%2:34:04::
their
thumbs
,
and
no
mother
need
worry worry%2:37:00::
if
a
child
continues continue%2:42:01::
this
habit
until
he
is be%2:42:03::
two
or
three
years
old
.
Occasional
sucking
up
to
the
fifth
year
may_not
affect affect%2:29:00::
a
youngster
's
teeth
;
but
after_that
,
if
thumb-sucking
pressure
is be%2:42:03::
frequent
,
it
will
have have%2:40:00::
an
effect
.
Malocclusion
can
also
result result%2:42:00::
if
baby
teeth
are
lost lose%2:40:02::
too_soon
or
retained retain%2:40:01::
too
long
.
If
a
child
loses lose%2:40:02::
a
molar
at
the
age
of
two
,
the
adjoining
teeth
may
shift shift%2:38:00::
toward
the
empty
space
,
thus
narrowing narrow%2:30:00::
the
place
intended
for
the
permanent
ones
and
producing produce%2:36:03::
a
jumble
.
If
baby
teeth
are
retained retain%2:40:01::
too
long
,
the
incoming
second
teeth
may
be
prevented prevent%2:41:00::
from
emerging emerge%2:30:00::
at
the
normal
time
or
may
have_to
erupt erupt%2:30:04::
in
the
wrong
place
.
Every
orthodontist
sees see%2:39:02::
children
who
are
embarrassed embarrass%2:37:00::
by
their
malformed
teeth
.
Some
such
youngsters
rarely
smile smile%2:29:00::
,
or
they
try try%2:41:00::
to
speak speak%2:32:00::
with
the
mouth
closed
.
In
certain
cases
,
as
in
Dick_Stewart
's
,
a
child
's
personality
is
affected affect%2:30:00::
.
Yet
from
the
dentist
's
point_of_view
,
bad-fitting
teeth
should
be
corrected correct%2:30:00::
for
physical
reasons
.
Bad
alignment
may
result result%2:42:02::
in
early
loss
of
teeth
through
a
breakdown
of
the
bony
structure
that
supports support%2:35:00::
their
roots
.
This
serious
condition
,
popularly
known
as
pyorrhea
,
is be%2:42:03::
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
tooth
loss
in
adults
.
Then
,
too
,
misplaced
or
jammed-together
teeth
are be%2:42:03::
prone
to
trapping trap%2:35:01::
food
particles
,
increasing increase%2:30:02::
the
likelihood
of
rapid
decay
.
``
For
these
and
other
reasons
''
,
says say%2:32:00::
Dr._Brodie
,
``
orthodontics
can
prolong prolong%2:30:00::
the
life
of
teeth
''
.
The
failure
of
teeth
to
fit fit%2:42:02::
together
when
closed
interferes interfere%2:41:01::
with
normal
chewing
,
so_that
a
child
may
swallow swallow%2:34:00::
food
whole
and
put put%2:35:05::
a
burden
on
his
digestive_system
.
Because
of
these
chewing
troubles
,
a
child
may
avoid avoid%2:34:00::
certain
foods
he
needs need%2:34:00::
for
adequate
nutrition
.
Badly
placed
teeth
can
also
cause cause%2:36:00::
such
a
speech

lisping
.
``

says say%2:32:00::
Dr._Brodie

In
the
period
from
10

14
the
permanent
set
of
teeth
is be%2:42:03::
usually
completed
,
yet
the
continuing

bony
tissue

moving
badly
placed
teeth

easy

Orthodontic
work
is be%2:42:03::
possible

During

immediately

after

the
orthodontist

During

the
retention

Susie
's
teeth
have
now
been
guided guide%2:41:00::
into
a

But
because

sometimes
may

a

The

People
today

value

as

result
there
are be%2:42:03::
more

Most

to
cover cover%2:42:00::
the
cost
of
diagnostic
materials
and
construction

but
usually
the
remainder
of
the
cost
may
be
spread spread%2:35:00::
over
a
period

months

years

In
many
cities
in
the
United_States
clinics
associated
with
dental_schools
will
take take%2:40:07::
