In

the_British

major
theories
of

while
the
other
acted_as act_as%2:42:00::
a

The
participants
were be%2:42:06::
Professor_H._Bondi
,
professor
of
mathematics
at
King
's
College
,
London
;
Dr._W._B._Bonnor
,
reader

at
Queen_Elizabeth_College

Dr._R._A._Lyttleton

a
lecturer
at
St._John

and
a
reader
in

astronomy
at
the
University
of
Cambridge
;
and
Dr._G._J._Whitrow
,
reader
in
applied_mathematics
at
the
Imperial_College
of
Science
and
Technology
,
London
.
Dr._Whitrow
functioned function%2:42:12::
as
moderator
.
The
programs
were
so
well
received receive%2:35:00::
by
the_British
public
that
the
arguments
have
been
published publish%2:36:01::
in
a
totally
engrossing
little
book
called
,
``
Rival
Theories
of
Cosmology
''
.
Dr._Bonnor
begins begin%2:30:00::
with
a
discussion
of
the
relativistic
theories
of
the
universe
,
based base%2:31:00::
on
the
general
theory_of_relativity
.
First_of_all
,
and
this
has
been
calculated calculate%2:31:03::
by
observation
,
the
universe
is
expanding expand%2:38:00::
-
that_is
,
the
galaxies
are
receding recede%2:38:00::
from
each
other
at
immense
speeds
.
Because
of_this
Dr._Bonnor
holds hold%2:37:00::
that
the
universe
is
becoming become%2:30:00::
more
thinly
populated populate%2:42:00::
by
stars
and
whatever
else
is be%2:42:00::
there
.
This
expansion
has
been
going_on go_on%2:42:00::
for
an
estimated
eight
billion
years
.
Dr._Bonnor
supports support%2:32:00::
the
idea
that
the
universe
both
expands expand%2:38:00::
and
contracts contract%2:30:04::
,
that
in
several
billion
years
the
expansion
will
slow_up slow_up%2:30:03::
and
reverse reverse%2:30:00::
itself
and
that
the
contraction
will
set_in set_in%2:42:00::
.
Then
,
after
many_more
billions
of
years
,
when
all
the
galaxies
are
whistling
toward
a
common
center
,
this
movement
will
slow_down slow_down%2:30:01::
and
reverse reverse%2:30:00::
itself
again
.
Professor_Bondi
disagrees disagree%2:32:00::
with
the
expansion-contraction
theory
.
He
supports support%2:32:00::
the
steady-state
theory
which
holds hold%2:37:00::
that
matter
is
continually
being
created create%2:36:02::
in
space
.
For
this
reason
,
he
says say%2:32:00::
,
the
density
of
the
universe
always
remains remain%2:30:00::
the
same
even_though
the
galaxies
are
zooming zoom%2:38:00::
away
in_all_directions
.
New
galaxies
are
forever
being
formed form%2:30:01::
to
fill_in fill_in%2:32:00::
the
gaps
left leave%2:42:00::
by
the
receding
galaxies
.
If
this
is be%2:42:03::
true
,
then
the
universe
today
looks look%2:39:01::
just_as
it
did
millions
of
years
ago
and
as
it
will
look look%2:39:01::
millions
of
years
hence
,
even_though
the
universe
is
expanding expand%2:38:00::
.
For
new
galaxies
to
be
created create%2:36:00::
,
Professor_Bondi
declares declare%2:32:00::
,
it
would
only
be be%2:42:03::
necessary
for
a
single
hydrogen_atom
to
be
created create%2:36:00::
in
an
area
the
size
of
your
living_room
once
every
few
million
years
.
He
contends contend%2:32:02::
this
idea
does
n't
conflict conflict%2:42:00::
with
experiments
on_which
the
principle
of
conservation_of_matter
and
energy
is
based base%2:31:00::
because
some
slight
error
must
be
assumed assume%2:31:00::
in
such
experiments
.
Dr._Lyttleton
backs back%2:41:00::
the
theory
that
we
live live%2:42:08::
in
an
electric
universe
and
this
theory
starts start%2:30:00::
with
the
behavior
of
protons
and
electrons
.
Protons
and
electrons
bear bear%2:42:14::
opposite
electrical
charges
which
make make%2:32:00::
them
attract attract%2:35:00::
each
other
,
and
when
they
are be%2:42:03::
joined
they
make_up make_up%2:42:00::
an
atom
of
hydrogen
-
the
basic
building_block
of
matter
.
The
charges
of
the
electron
and
proton
are
believed believe%2:31:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
exactly
equal
and
opposite
,
but
Dr._Lyttleton
is be%2:42:03::
not
so
sure
.
Suppose suppose%2:31:01::
,
says say%2:32:00::
Dr._Lyttleton
,
the
proton
has have%2:40:00::
a
slightly
greater
charge
than
the
electron
(
so
slight
it
is be%2:42:03::
presently
immeasurable
)
.
This
would
give give%2:40:03::
the
hydrogen_atom
a
slight
charge-excess
.
Now
if
one
hydrogen_atom
were
placed place%2:35:00::
at
the
surface
of
a
large
sphere
of
hydrogen_atoms
,
it
would
be
subject subject%2:33:00::
both
to
the
gravitation
of
the
sphere
and
the
charge-excess
of
all
those
atoms
in
the
sphere
.
Because
electrical
forces
(
the
charge-excess
)
are be%2:42:03::
far
more
powerful
than
gravitation
,
the
surface
hydrogen_atoms
would
shoot shoot%2:38:00::
away
from
the
sphere
.
Dr._Lyttleton
then
imagines imagine%2:36:00::
the
universe
as
a
large
hydrogen
sphere
with
surface
atoms
shooting shoot%2:38:00::
away
from_it
.
This
,
he
claims claim%2:32:00::
,
would
reasonably
account_for account_for%2:42:00::
the
expansion
of
the
universe
.

with
the

the

the

the
jargon

to
work work%2:38:00::
its
way
into
almost
every
field

It
is be%2:42:03::
clear
from
this
discussion
that
cosmologists
of
every
persuasion
look look%2:39:00::
hopefully
toward
the
day
when

with

,
the
intense
absorption
of
ultra-violet
rays
in
the
earth
's
atmosphere
seriously
hinders hinder%2:41:01::

These
scientists
are be%2:42:03::
convinced

unclouded
by
the
earth

will
go_a_long_way go_a_long_way%2:42:00::
toward

There

that

Seeming seem%2:39:00::

this
