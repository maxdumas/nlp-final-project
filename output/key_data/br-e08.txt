When

one

However
,
some
formulas
are

more_than
others
.
We
'll
take take%2:31:03::
them
in
the
general
order
of
their
popularity
.
A
rodder
should
be be%2:42:03::
able
to
compute compute%2:31:00::
the
displacement
of
his
engine
.
Displacement
is
sometimes
referred refer%2:32:01::
to
as
``
swept

.
Most
entry
blanks
for
competitive
events
require require%2:32:01::
engine
displacement
information
because
of
class
restrictions
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
good
to
be be%2:42:03::
able
to
compute compute%2:31:00::
displacement
so_that
changes
in
it
resulting result%2:42:00::
from
boring
and
stroking
can
be
computed compute%2:31:00::
.
Factors
involved involve%2:42:01::
in
the
displacement
formula
are be%2:42:03::
the
bore
diameter
of
the
engine
's
cylinders
,
the
length
of
the
piston
stroke
,
the
number
of
cylinders
in
the
engine
,
and
a
constant
.
The
constant
is be%2:42:06::
.7854
,
which
is be%2:42:06::
one-quarter
of

,
another
constant
known_as

Pi
is
used use%2:34:01::
in
formulas
concerned concern%2:42:00::
with
the
dimensions

circles
.
Actually
,
the
engine
displacement
formula
is be%2:42:06::
the
standard
formula
for
computing compute%2:31:00::
the
volume
of
a
cylinder
of
any
type
with
an
added
factor
that
represents represent%2:42:02::
the
number
of
cylinders
in
the
engine

The
cross-sectional
area
of
the
cylinders
is
determined determine%2:32:00::
and_then
the
volume
of
the
individual
cylinders
is
computed compute%2:31:00::
by
multiplying multiply%2:31:00::
the
area
by
the
stroke
length
,
which
is be%2:42:06::
the
equivalent
of
the
length
of
the
cylinders
.
Multiplying multiply%2:31:00::
the
result
by
the
number
of
cylinders
in
the
engine
gives give%2:40:05::
the
engine
's
total
displacement
.
The
formula
is be%2:42:06::
:
*
*
f
.
Dimensions
in
inches
,
and
fractions
of
inches
will
give give%2:40:05::
the
displacement

Dimensions
in
centimeters
and
fractions
of
centimeters
will
give give%2:40:05::
the
displacement

)
.
One
inch
equals equal%2:42:00::
2.54
centimeters
:
one
cubic_inch
equals equal%2:42:00::
16.38

For_example

let
's
consider consider%2:39:00::
a

These

The
formula

f

To

the

multiply multiply%2:31:00::
the
numbers

A
cylinder

computed compute%2:31:00::
by

the
cylinder

volume
,
or
its

,
with
the
total

Cylinder
volume
can
be
determined determine%2:32:00::
mathematically
but
combustion
chamber
volume
must
be
measured measure%2:31:00::
with
a
liquid
.
Cylinder
volume
is
determined determine%2:32:00::
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
for
the
displacement
formula
:
*
*
f
.
To
measure measure%2:31:00::
the
volume
of
one
of
the
combustion
chambers
in
the
cylinder_head
,
install install%2:35:00::
the
valves
and
spark_plug
in
the
chamber
and
support support%2:35:00::
the
head
so_that
its
gasket
surface
is be%2:42:03::
level
.
Then
pour pour%2:38:03::
water
or
light
oil
from
a
graduated
beaker
into
the
chamber
to
fill fill%2:30:01::
the
chamber
to
its
gasket
surface
.
Do
not
overfill overfill%2:30:00::
the
chamber
.
This
is be%2:42:03::
possible
with
water
and
other
liquids
that
have have%2:42:00::
a
high
surface_tension
.
Such
liquids
will
rise rise%2:38:00::
to
a
considerable
height
above
the
surface
around
the
chamber
before
they
will
flow_out flow_out%2:30:00::
of
the
chamber
.
The
amount
of
liquid
poured pour%2:38:03::
into
the
chamber
is
determined determine%2:32:00::
by
subtracting subtract%2:31:00::
the
quantity
still
in
the
beaker
when
the
chamber
is be%2:42:03::
full
from
the
original
quantity
.
Most
beakers
are be%2:42:03::
graduated
in
cubic_centimeters
(
cc
)
,
making make%2:32:00::
it
necessary
to
convert convert%2:30:00::
the
result
to
cubic_inches
.
However
,
the
displacement
of
the
cylinder
can
be
converted convert%2:30:00::
to
cubic_centimeters
.
The
compression
ratio
arrived_at arrive_at%2:38:00::
with
the
formula
will
be be%2:42:03::
the
same
regardless_of
whether
cubic_inches
or
cubic_centimeters
are
used use%2:34:01::
.
The
only
precaution
is be%2:42:06::
that
all
volumes
used use%2:34:01::
in
the
formula
be
quoted quote%2:32:00::
in
the
same
terms
.
The
volume
of
the
cylinder
opening
in_the_head
gasket
must
be
computed compute%2:31:00::
by
multiplying multiply%2:31:00::
its
area
in
square_inches
by
the
gasket
's
thickness
in
thousandths
of
an
inch
.
Sometimes
it
is be%2:42:03::
necessary
to
roughly
calculate calculate%2:31:00::
the
square_inch
area
of
the
opening
but
the
calculation
can
usually
be
made make%2:41:00::
with
sufficient
accuracy
that
it
won
n't
affect affect%2:30:00::
the
final
computation
.
The
volume
of
the
opening
is_added
to
the
combustion
chamber
volume
.
Another
thing
that
must
be
taken take%2:31:03::
into
consideration
is be%2:42:06::
the
volume
of
the
area
between
the
top
of
the
piston
and
the
top
of
the
cylinder_block
when
the
piston
is be%2:42:03::
in
top
dead
center
position
.
Compute compute%2:31:00::
this
volume
by
measuring measure%2:31:00::
the
distance
from
the
top
of
the
block
to
the
piston
head
as
accurately
as
possible
with
a
depth
micrometer
or
some
other
precision
measuring measure%2:31:00::
device
and_then
multiply multiply%2:31:00::
the
area
of
the
cylinder
by
the
depth
.
The
formula
for
this
step
is be%2:42:06::
:
*
*
f
This
volume
is_added
to
the
total
volume
of
the
combustion
chamber
and
head_gasket
opening
.
The
total
of
these
three
volumes
is be%2:42:06::
the
``
final
combustion
chamber
volume
''
.
After
the
factors
just
described describe%2:32:00::
have
been
computed compute%2:31:00::
,
they
are
applied_to apply%2:41:05::
the
following
formula
:
*
*
f
For
an
example
let
's
dream_up dream_up%2:36:00::
an
engine
that
has have%2:42:00::
a
final
combustion
chamber
volume
of
5
cubic_inches
and
a
cylinder
volume
of
45
cubic_inches
.
Applying apply%2:41:05::
these
figures
to
the
formula
we
get get%2:31:03::
the
equation
:
*
*
f
The
compression
ratio
is be%2:42:06::
10
to
1
.
This
method
of
computing compute%2:31:00::
compression

cannot
be
used use%2:34:01::
accurately
for
engines
that
have have%2:42:00::
pistons
with
either
domed
or
irregularly
shaped
heads
.
Any
irregularity
on
the
piston
heads
will
make make%2:32:00::
it
impossible
,
with
normal
means
,
to
determine determine%2:32:00::
the
final
combustion
chamber
volume
because
the
volume
displaced displace%2:38:01::
by
the
piston
heads
cannot
be
readily
computed compute%2:31:00::
.
The
only
way
to
determine determine%2:32:00::
the
final
combustion
chamber
volume
when
such
pistons
are
used use%2:34:01::
is be%2:42:06::
by

it
with

bolted bolt%2:35:00::
to
the
cylinder_block
and
the
piston
is be%2:42:05::
in
top
dead

.
There
are be%2:42:00::
four
versions
of

the

of

any

Tire
size
can
be
determined determine%2:32:00::
in
several
ways
but
the
one
that
is be%2:42:06::
the
easiest
and
as
accurate
as
any
is be%2:42:06::
by
measuring measure%2:31:00::
the
effective
radius
of
a
wheel
and
tire
assembly
.
This
is
done do%2:41:01::
by
measuring measure%2:31:00::
the
distance
from
the
surface
on_which
the
tire
is
resting rest%2:35:00::
to
the
center
of
the
rear
axle
shaft
.
A
tire
must
be
inflated inflate%2:30:00::
to
its
normal
hot
operating
pressure
and
the
car
must
be
loaded load%2:35:00::
to
its
operating
weight
when
this
measurement
is
made make%2:41:00::
.
The
measurement
must
be be%2:42:03::
in
inches
.
Any
fraction
of
an
inch
involved involve%2:42:01::
in
the
measurement
must
be
converted convert%2:30:00::
to
a
decimal
equivalent_to
simplify simplify%2:30:01::
the
mathematics
.
When
tire
size
is
measured measure%2:31:00::
in_this
manner
a
constant
of
168
is
used use%2:34:01::
in
the
formula
.
To
determine determine%2:32:00::
car
speed
for
a
given
combination
of
engine
speed
,
gear
ratio
,
and
tire
size
,
the
formula
is be%2:42:06::

For
an

a

the
equation

To
