to
me

has
hit hit%2:40:12::
upon
the
real
problem
that
bothers bother%2:41:01::
all_of

how
do

This

and
can
leave leave%2:42:02::
us
hopeless
in
the
face

widespread
distress

I
know know%2:31:01::
of
no
other
solution
than
the
one
N._C.
proposes propose%2:32:00::
-
to
do do%2:36:01::
what
we
can
for
each
sufferer
as
he
confronts confront%2:33:00::
us
,
hoping hope%2:37:01::
that
this
will
spread spread%2:35:07::
beyond
him
to
others
at_some_time

Never
have
I
seen see%2:39:02::
this

so
clearly

so
sympathetically

Thank_you
for
the
illustrated
editorial
``

It
is be%2:42:03::
both
great
writing

profound
religion

N._C.
has
said say%2:32:00::
something
important

well
that
this

I
feel feel%2:31:00::
that

very
core

direct
in

appear
to
those
of
us
living live%2:42:08::
here

I

gained gain%2:40:03::

.
The
current
stereotype
of
straight
news
reporting
was be%2:42:03::
probably
invaluable
in
protecting protect%2:33:00::
the
press
and
its
readers
from
pollution
by
that
combination
of
doctored
fact
,
fancy
,
and
personal
opinion
called
yellow_journalism
which
flourished flourish%2:30:01::
in_this
country
more_than
a
generation
ago
.
We
do
n't
need need%2:34:00::
this
type
of
protection
any_more
.
The
public
is
now
armed arm%2:33:00::
with
sophistication
and
numerous
competing
media
.
Besides
,
there
are be%2:42:00::
no_longer
enough
corruptible
journalists
about
.
The
accepted
method
of
writing write%2:36:00::
news
has have%2:42:00::
two
major
liabilities
.
First
,
it
does
not
communicate communicate%2:32:01::
.
A
reporter
restricted restrict%2:41:00::
to
the
competing
propaganda
statements
of
both
sides
in
a
major
labor
dispute
,
for_instance
,
is be%2:42:03::
unable
to
tell tell%2:32:00::
his
readers
half
of_what
he
knows know%2:31:01::
about
the
causes
of
the
dispute
.
Second
,
it
subjects subject%2:33:00::
the
news
to
distortion
by
the
unscrupulous
.
The
charges
by
the
late
junior
Senator
from
Wisconsin
not_only
destroyed destroy%2:35:00::
innocent
people
but
misled mislead%2:32:00::
the
nation
.
Yet
the
press
was be%2:42:03::
powerless
to
put put%2:35:05::
these
charges
in
perspective
in
its
news
columns
.
despite
several
years
of
front-page
stories
,
the
average
citizen
was be%2:42:03::
unable
to
get get%2:30:03::
a
complete
picture
of
McCarthy
until
he
saw see%2:39:03::
on
the
television
screen
what
the
reporters
had
been
seeing see%2:39:02::
all_along
but
had have%2:40:00::
no
effective
way
of
communicating communicate%2:32:01::
.
The
Senator
had
boxed box_in%2:42:00::
them
in
with
their
own
restrictions
.
It
seems seem%2:39:01::
to
me
the
time
has
come come%2:38:04::
for
the
American
press
to
start start%2:36:01::
experimenting experiment%2:41:01::
with
ways
of
reporting report%2:32:04::
the
news
that
will
do do%2:36:01::
a
better
job
of
communicating
and
will
be be%2:42:03::
less
subject_to
abuse
by
those
who
have
learned learn%2:31:00::
how
to
manipulate manipulate%2:41:00::
the
present
stereotype
to
serve serve%2:42:02::
their
own
ends
.
The
objective
should
be be%2:42:06::
to
provide provide%2:40:00::
a
method
of
getting get%2:30:02::
into
print
a
higher
percentage
than
is be%2:42:03::
now
possible
of
the
relevant
information
in
the
possession
of
reporters
and
editors
.
I
would
like like%2:37:01::
to
see see%2:39:00::
you
devote devote%2:31:00::
some
space
in
an
early
issue
to
the
news
blackout
concerning concern%2:42:00::
President_Kennedy
's
activities
,
so_far
as
Southern_California
is be%2:42:03::
concerned
.
You
have
on
more_than
one
occasion
praised praise%2:32:00::
the
idea
of
a
televised
press_conference
and
the
chance
it
gives give%2:40:03::
the
people
to
form form%2:36:00::
intelligent
opinions
.
To_begin_with
,
the
all-powerful
Los_Angeles
Times
does
not
publish publish%2:36:01::
a
transcript
of
these
press_conferences
.
I
am be%2:42:03::
sure
that
they
did
when
Eisenhower
was be%2:41:00::
President
.
Next
,
because
of
the
time
differential
,
the
conferences
come_on come_on%2:30:01::
the
networks
during
the
middle
of
the
day
.
Up
until_now
,
the
networks
have
grudgingly
run run%2:36:01::
half-hour
tapes
at
5
P._M.
or
sometimes
7
or
10
:
30
P._M.
.
Even
then
,
a_few
of
the
``
less
interesting
''
questions
are
edited_out edit_out%2:30:00::
and
glibly
summarized summarize%2:32:00::
by
a
commentator
.
However
,
last
night
the
tapes
were
not
run run%2:36:01::
at_all
during
the
evening
hours
and
all
we
got get%2:30:03::
on
TV
were be%2:42:06::
a_few
snatches
which
Douglas_Edwards
and
Huntley
and
Brinkley
could
squeeze squeeze%2:35:03::
into
their
programs
.
This
is be%2:42:03::
no
criticism
of
them
,
as
they
obviously
cannot
get get%2:30:02::
a
half-hour
program
into
a
fifteen-minute
news
summary
.
The
radio_stations
did
run run%2:36:01::
``
transcripts
''
(
I
thought think%2:31:03::
)
during
the
evening
hours
.
However
,
by
comparing compare%2:31:00::
the
TV
snatches
,
two
different
radio_station
re-runs
,
and
the
censored
Los_Angeles
Times
version
,
I
found find%2:39:02::
that
the
radio_stations
had
edited_out edit_out%2:30:00::
questions
(
ABC
removed remove%2:41:02::
the
one
regarding regard%2:42:00::
Laos
)
or
even
a
paragraph
out
of
the
middle
of
the
President
's
answer
.
I
am be%2:42:03::
interested
to
know know%2:31:01::
he
is
getting get%2:30:03::
mail
from
all_over
the
country
about
the
``
abuse
''
he
is
being
subjected subject%2:33:00::
to
.
We
out
here
do
n't
see see%2:39:03::
enough
of
the
conference
to
know know%2:31:01::
he
is
being
abused abuse%2:41:00::
.
I
do
n't
know know%2:31:02::
if
this
is be%2:42:06::
the
situation
in
other
parts
of
the
country
;
apparently
it
is be%2:42:06::
not
.
It
also
happened happen%2:30:00::
with
the
Inauguration
,
which
was
not
re-run rerun%2:32:00::
at_all
during
the
evening
hours
,
and
I
wrote write%2:32:08::
to
the
TV
editor
of
the
Times
.
He
did
mention mention%2:32:00::
in
his
column
the
fact
that
he
had
received receive%2:40:00::
many
letters
about
this
and
he
himself
did
not
understand understand%2:31:00::
the
networks
and
the
independent
local
stations
'
not
doing do%2:41:01::
this
-
but
nothing
happened happen%2:30:01::
.
Can
you
bring bring%2:30:00::
the
networks
'
attention
to
this
?
I
was be%2:42:03::
interested
in
James_Webb_Young
's
MADISON
AVENUE
column
in_which
he
raised raise%2:32:00::
the
question
``
Do
We
Need need%2:34:00::
a
College
of
Propaganda
''
?
[
SR
,
Feb.

]
.
In
my
estimation
,
we
definitely
do
;
and
the
sad
part
of_it
is be%2:42:06::
that
we
had have%2:40:00::
one
,
which
was
rounding round%2:30:00::
into
excellent
shape
,
and
we
let let%2:41:00::
it
disintegrate disintegrate%2:30:00::
and
die die%2:30:00::
.
During
the
war
,
we
set_up set_up%2:41:02::
schools
for
the
teaching
of
psychological_warfare
,
which
included include%2:42:00::
the
teaching
of
propaganda
,
both
black_and_white
and
the
various
shades
of
grey
in_between
.
We
had have%2:40:04::
a_couple_of
schools
in_this
country
,
the
principal
one
being be%2:42:05::
on
the
Marshall_Field
estate
out
in
Lloyd
's
Neck
.
There
were be%2:42:05::
also
a
couple
in
Canada
,
and
several
in
England
.
The_English
schools
preceded precede%2:41:00::
ours
,
and
by
the
time
we
got_into get_into%2:42:00::
it
they
had
learned learn%2:31:00::
a_lot
about
the
techniques
of
propaganda
and
its
teaching
.
Four
of
us
here
in
the
United_States
attended attend%2:42:00::
,
first
as
students
,
then
as
instructors
,
almost
every
one
of
these
schools
,
in
England
,
Canada
,
and
the
United_States
.
We
set_up set_up%2:41:02::
the
Lloyd
's
Neck
school
,
worked_out work_out%2:30:01::
its
curriculum
,
and
taught teach%2:32:00::
there
.
Toward
the
end
of
the
war
,
we
really
felt feel%2:31:00::
that
we
had
learned learn%2:31:00::
something
about
propaganda
and_how
to
teach teach%2:32:00::
it
.
When
the
end
did
come come%2:30:01::
,
and
the
schools
were
disbanded disband%2:38:01::
and
abandoned abandon%2:31:00::
,
we
felt feel%2:31:00::
and
hoped hope%2:37:01::
that
the
machinery
of
psychological_warfare
would
not
be
allowed allow%2:41:00::
to
rust rust%2:30:00::
.
We
hoped hope%2:37:01::
that
its
practitioners
and
teachers
might
be
put put%2:35:00::
on
some
sort_of
reserve
list
and
called_back call_back%2:40:00::
for
refresher_courses
each_year
or_so
.
Alas
,
no
such
thing
happened happen%2:30:01::
.
There
apparently
is
no
school
of
propaganda
or
psychological_warfare
.
A
study
at
the
Pentagon
and
at
the
service
academies
revealed reveal%2:39:01::
that
nothing
was
being
done do%2:36:01::
there
.
And
not_one
of
the
four
men
who
attended attend%2:42:00::
all
the
schools
has
ever
been
called_on call_on%2:32:00::

Sir_Robert_Watson-Watt
's
``
rebuttal

of
Sir_Charles_Snow
's
Godkin
Lectures
is
marred mar%2:30:00::
throughout
by
too
forceful
a
desire

defend defend%2:32:00::
Lindemann
and
apparently
himself
from
Sir_Charles
'
supposed
falsehoods
while
stating state%2:32:00::
those
``
falsehoods
''
in
an
unclear
incoherent
argument
.
The
article
presents present%2:32:00::
the
reader
with
an
absurdity
at
its
beginning
.
It
calls call%2:32:00::
the
conclusion
admitted admit%2:32:00::
valid
by
``
historians
and
military
strategists
alike
''
a
``
perverted
conclusion

nonsense
''
.
It

,
impressionistic
conception

Lindemann
contributing contribute%2:40:01::
another
aspect

the
man

but
on
no_more
authoritative
basis

Sir_Charles

account
.
We
are
left leave%2:42:02::
to
choose choose%2:31:00::
between
the
two
Lindemanns
.
The
only
fact
that
holds hold%2:40:00::
any

the
article
is be%2:42:03::
the
result

But
we
are be%2:42:03::
to
believe believe%2:31:00::
that
Lindemann
actively
supported support%2:41:01::
radar
outside

Tizard_Committee

and
dissembling dissemble%2:32:00::

If
so

I
would
lean lean%2:42:01::

I
think think%2:31:01::

was be%2:42:03::

error

To
the
unfortunate

the
Godkin

it
casts cast%2:36:02::
an
unjustifiable
