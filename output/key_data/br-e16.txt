There

Needless
to
say
,
you
can
n't
build build%2:36:00::
Hotei
in
a_couple_of
weeks
.
Our
building
time
was be%2:42:06::
slightly
over
400
hours

but
the
total
cost
for
the
hull
with
Fiberglas

hardware
was be%2:42:06::
under

.
A

would
cost cost%2:42:00::
close_to
$
3000
.
Consider consider%2:31:01::

your

A

The

The

This
is be%2:42:03::
an

Fairing
is be%2:42:06::
always
a

job
but
the
work
can
be
cut_down cut_down%2:30:00::
considerably
with
a
Skill
planer

a
simple
jig
.
I
clamped clamp%2:35:00::
a
30

piece
of
aluminum
to
the
base
of
the
planer
with
a

The

me
to

If
you
do
n't
own own%2:40:00::
a
planer

do

want want%2:37:00::
to
buy buy%2:40:00::
one
,
it
's
well
worth
renting rent%2:40:01::
.
The

is be%2:42:06::
five-ply

This
can
be

The
42

leaves leave%2:42:03::
very
little
waste
.
Four
pieces
are
used use%2:34:01::

Plank plank%2:35:00::

Another
person
inside
with
a
weight
against
each
batten
will
help help%2:41:00::
in
the
fastening
.
The
best
procedure
is be%2:42:06::
to
have have%2:30:00::
a_few
friends
hold hold%2:42:00::
the
planking
in_place
while
you
mark mark%2:35:09::
it
off
.
Then
trim trim%2:35:03::
the
excess
.
I
used use%2:34:01::
a
Homemaster
Routo-Jig
made make%2:36:00::
by
Porter_Cable
for
this
job
.
It
's
good
for
cutting cut%2:35:00::
all
the
planking
because
it
cuts cut%2:35:00::
with
a
bit-like
blade
at
high
rpm
and
does
not
chatter chatter%2:35:00::
the
plywood
like
a
saber
saw
.
When
cut cut%2:35:00::
,
the
planking
is
clamped clamp%2:35:00::
in_place
for
a
final
and
careful
trimming
.
Then
it
is
marked mark%2:35:09::
on_the_inside
where
it
comes come%2:30:01::
in
contact
with
the
transom
,
frames
,
keelson
and
all
the
battens
.
It
may
then
be
pre
drilled drill%2:35:00::
for
the
fastenings
.
The
next
step
is be%2:42:06::
to
remove remove%2:30:00::
it
and
spread spread%2:35:00::
glue
where
it
has
been
marked mark%2:35:09::
at
the
contact
points
.
Then
it
is
replaced replace%2:35:00::
and
fastened fasten%2:35:01::
.
The
bottom
planking
is
applied apply%2:35:00::
in
the
same
manner
.
After
planking plank%2:35:00::
,
the
bottom
gets get%2:40:00::
a
layer
of
Fiberglas
.
The
spray
rails
are
first
glued glue%2:35:00::
on_the_outside
and
fastened fasten%2:35:01::
from
the
inside
with
screws
.
Then
the
chines
are
rounded_off round_off%2:30:01::
and
the
bottom
is
rough
sanded sand%2:35:00::
in
preparation
.
Since
the
sides
are
also
covered cover%2:35:00::
up
to
the
spray
rails
,
they
are
also
rough
sanded sand%2:35:00::
in_that
area
.
The
cloth
is
laid lay%2:35:01::
on
one
half
of
the
bottom
at_a_time
.
A
50
-
inch
width
is
used use%2:34:01::
on
each
side
and
it
laps lap%2:42:00::
the
keel
line
by
about
three
inches
.
Lay lie%2:35:01::
the
cloth
in_place

trim trim%2:35:03::
it
to
size

Then
remove remove%2:30:00::
it
and
give give%2:32:03::
the
whole
bottom
a
coat
of
resin
.
When
the
resin
has
hardened harden%2:30:00::
,
mix mix%2:30:00::
up
another
batch
with
a
pigment
added add%2:30:00::
if
you
wish wish%2:37:02::
.
I
used use%2:34:01::
bright
red
,
mixing mix_in%2:30:00::
the
pigment
in
thoroughly
before
adding add%2:30:00::
the
hardener
.
Using use%2:34:01::
a
cheap
brush
,
coat coat%2:35:00::
one
side
of
the
bottom
with
the
resin
and_then
apply apply%2:35:00::
the
cloth
.
When
the
cloth
is be%2:42:03::
smooth
,
apply apply%2:35:00::
another
coat
of
resin
,
spreading spread%2:35:00::
it
with
a
paint_roller
.
Be be%2:42:03::
sure
it
is be%2:42:03::
well
saturated
and_then
allow allow%2:31:01::
it
to
harden harden%2:30:00::
.
When
the
whole
bottom
has
hardened harden%2:30:00::
,
use use%2:34:01::
a
disk
sander
to
feather feather%2:35:01::
the
edges
of
the
cloth
at
the
keel
line
and
near
the
spray
rail
.
Then
lay lay%2:35:01::
a
three-inch-wide
strip
of
cloth
along
the
keel
line
from
the
transom
to_the_point
of
the
stem
.
Before
the
resin
has
hardened harden%2:30:00::
,
screw screw%2:35:00::
a
one-inch
mahogany
keel
strip
along
the
centerline
.
This
protects protect%2:33:00::
the
bottom
in

The
hull
is
now
turned_over turn_over%2:38:02::
(
with
the
help
of
about
seven
friends
)
and
placed place%2:35:00::
in
a_level
,
well-braced
position
.
I
set set%2:35:00::
it
on
the
Gator

I
laid lay%2:35:01::
three

also
installing instal%2:35:00::
a
bow

at
this
time

For
added
strength
,
I
also
fastened fasten%2:35:01::
a
small
block
on
each
side
of
every
frame
and
batten
joint
.
Again
,
these
blocks
were
set set%2:35:02::
in

After
trimming trim%2:35:03::
off
the
