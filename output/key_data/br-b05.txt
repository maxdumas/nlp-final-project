Mr._Balaguer

The

But
automation

Walter_Reuther

Jimmy_Hoffa

this

have have%2:40:04::
little
patience

The
concept

outmoded

and
in

it

itself
to
survive survive%2:42:01::
.
The
Army
,
Navy
and
Air_Force
,
among
others
,
may
question question%2:32:01::
Secretary_Freeman
's
claim
that
the
high
estate
of
United_States
agriculture
is be%2:42:06::
the
``
strongest
deterrent
''
to
the
spread
of
communism
.
But
the
secretary
insists insist%2:32:00::
that
the
success
of
the
American
farmer
is be%2:42:03::
the
``
greatest
single
source
of
strength
''
in
the
struggle
to
insure insure%2:32:00::
freedom
around
the
world
.
Mr._Freeman
said say%2:32:00::
that
in
many_of
the
countries
he
visited visit%2:38:00::
on
a
recent
world
trade
trip
people
were
more
awed
by
America
's
capacity
to
produce produce%2:36:05::
food
surpluses
than
by
our
industrial
production
-
or
even
by
the
Soviet
's
successes
in
space
.
This
should
n't
surprise surprise%2:31:00::
the
secretary
;
American
taxpayers
have
been
impressed impress%2:37:00::
by
the
surpluses
for
a
long
,
long_time
.
In_fact
,
over
the
years
,
the
American
farmer
's
capacity
to
over-produce overproduce%2:36:00::
has
cost cost%2:42:01::
the
taxpayers
a
large
dollar
.
And
thus_far
,
Mr._Freeman
has
offered offer%2:41:00::
very
little
relief
.
The
1961
feed_grain
program
,
which
the
secretary
sponsored sponsor%2:40:01::
,
has
been
declared declare%2:32:02::
a_billion
dollar
fiasco
.
In
exchange
for
higher
price_supports
,
growers
pledged pledge%2:32:00::
reduction
in
planted
acreage
.
But
the
farmers
outsmarted outsmart%2:33:00::
Washington
by
shortening shorten%2:30:01::
the
distance
between
the
rows
and
pouring pour%2:38:03::

fertilizer
.
The
result
:
$
1.1
billion
added add%2:30:00::
to
the
deficit
in
the
federal
budget

Perhaps
,
as
Mr._Freeman
says say%2:32:01::
,
American
agriculture
may
stop stop%2:41:00::
the
Communists
,
but
it
is
also
swindling swindle%2:41:00::
the
American

A
Senate
subcommittee
headed head%2:41:00::
by
Sen._Jackson

Washington
has
been
going_over go_over%2:31:00::
the
State_Department

has
reached reach%2:38:06::
some

The

it
needs need%2:42:00::
fewer

better

people
,
Sen._Jackson
says say%2:32:00::
.
The
subcommittee
is be%2:42:03::
not
alone
in
questioning question%2:32:02::
the
effectiveness
of
the
department
.
President_Kennedy
has
indicated indicate%2:32:03::
his
dissatisfaction
with
its
performance
.
But
those
who
would
revitalize revitalize%2:29:00::
so
complex
an
organization
must

first_of_all
,
overcome overcome%2:37:00::
the
resistance
of
layers

wedded
to

suspicious

fearful

Nor

This

to

confusion
and
has
not

it

But
competent
observers
believe believe%2:31:04::
he
is
making make%2:41:00::
progress
,
particularly
toward
what
Sen._Jackson
lists list%2:32:00::
as
the
primary
need
-
``

.
The
Jackson
report
will
provide provide%2:40:00::

``
in

Mr._Rusk
should
also
draw draw%2:40:00::
comfort
from
Sen._Jackson
's
recommendation
that
congressional
methods

with

Self-criticism
is be%2:42:03::

needed
commodity
in
Congress
.
Forecasting
economic
activity
is be%2:42:03::
a
hazardous
undertaking
even
for
the
specialist

But
now
apparently
the
job
of
Secretary
of
Labor
requires require%2:42:00::
that
he
be be%2:42:03::
willing
to
risk risk%2:41:00::
his
reputation

prognosticator

James_P._Mitchell
,
when
he
was be%2:42:08::
the
head
of
the

promised promise%2:32:00::

His
successor
,
Secretary_Goldberg
,
also
has
been
guessing guess%2:32:00::
wrong
on
a
drop
in
the
unemployment
rate
which
has
been
holding hold%2:42:00::
just
under
7
per_cent

the
last
11

No

Mr._Goldberg

he
's
merely

by
predicting predict%2:32:00::
the

He
is

increase

a
spurt
in

and
a
gain

Mr._Mitchell
had have%2:40:04::
an
excuse
for
losing lose%2:33:00::
-
the
steel

lasted last%2:42:00::

Mr._Goldberg
has have%2:40:04::

The

to

on

keel
and
the
1961

Commerce_Secretary_Hodges
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
have
been
cast cast%2:36:01::
in
the
role
of
pacemaker
for
official
Washington
's
economic
forecasters

Weeks
ago
he
saw see%2:39:00::
a
business
upturn
in
the
second
quarter
of_this
year
while
his
colleagues
in

Cabinet
were
shaking shake%2:38:00::
their
heads
in_disagreement

Recently
Treasury_Secretary_Dillon
and
Labor_Secretary_Goldberg
fell fall%2:30:08::
into
line
with
Mr._Hodges
'
appraisal
,
though
there
has
been be%2:42:04::
some
reluctance
to
do do%2:41:01::
so
at
the
White_House
.
And
now
Mr._Hodges
has
pioneered pioneer%2:36:00::
further
into
the
economic
unknown
with
the
announcement
that
he
thinks think%2:31:01::
business
has
stopped stop%2:42:00::
sliding slide%2:38:00::
and
that
it
should
start start%2:42:00::
going go%2:30:01::
upward
from
this
point
.
He
is be%2:42:03::
the
first
top
administration
officer
to
see see%2:39:00::
the
bottom
of
the
slump
.
The
secretary
based base%2:31:00::
his
assessment
on
the
upturn
in
retail
sales
.
February
's
volume
was be%2:42:07::
1
per_cent
above
January
's
for
the
first
pickup
since
last
October
,
although
it
is be%2:42:03::
still
1.5
per_cent
off
from
February
1960
.
Corroborating corroborate%2:32:00::
Mr._Hodges
'
figures
was
the
Federal_Reserve_Board
's
report
of
the
large
sales
increase
in
the
nation
's
department_stores
for
the
week
ending end%2:42:00::
March
4
.
In
Newark
,
for_example
,
this
gain
was
put put%2:31:13::
at
26
per_cent
above
the
year-earlier
level
.
Of_course
,
some
of
the
credit
for
the
sale
boost
must
be
given give%2:32:01::
to
improvement
in
the
weather
and
to
the
fact
that
Easter
comes come%2:30:01::
more_than
two_weeks
earlier
than
in
1960
.
Another
optimistic
sign
,
this
one
from
the
Labor_Department
,
was be%2:42:06::
the
report
that
the
long
rise
in

payments
``
was

to

dropped drop%2:30:00::
by

the
week
ending end%2:42:00::
March
4

Mr._Hodges
is be%2:42:03::
so
hopeful
over
the
outlook
that
he
does
n't
think think%2:31:03::
there
will
be
any
need
of
a
cut
in
income_taxes

Well
,
we
can
