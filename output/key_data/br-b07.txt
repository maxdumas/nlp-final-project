Ambassador_Stevenson
yesterday
described describe%2:32:01::
the
U.
N
.
's
problem
of
electing elect%2:41:00::
a
temporary
successor
to
the
late
Dag_Hammarskjold
as
``
the
gravest
crisis
the
institution
has
faced face%2:32:00::
''
.
Of_course
it
is be%2:42:03::
.
If
the
decision
goes_wrong go_wrong%2:41:00::
,
it
may
be be%2:42:03::
-
as
Mr._Stevenson
fears fear%2:37:03::
-
``
the
first_step
on
the
slippery
path
downhill
''
to
a
U._N.
without
operational
responsibilities
and
without
effective
meaning
.
The
integrity
of
the
office
not
merely
requires require%2:42:00::
that
the
Secretary_General
shall
be be%2:42:03::
,
as
the
Charter
puts put%2:32:00::
it
,
``
the
chief
administrative
officer
of
the
Organization
''
,
but
that
neither
he
nor
his
staff
shall
seek seek%2:40:00::
or
receive receive%2:40:00::
instructions
from
any
government
or
any
other
authority
``
external
to
the
Organization
''
.
In_other_words
,
the
Secretary_General
is
to
be be%2:42:03::
a
nonpartisan
,
international
servant
,
not
a
political
,
national
one
.
He
should
be be%2:42:03::
,
as
Dag_Hammarskjold
certainly
was be%2:42:03::
,
a
citizen
of
the
world
.
The
Charter
does
stipulate stipulate%2:32:00::
that
``
due
regard
''
shall
be
paid pay%2:31:00::
to
the
importance
of
recruiting recruit%2:41:01::
the
staff
on
``
as
wide
a
geographical
basis
as
possible
''
.
The
United_States
and
its
allies
have
had have%2:40:00::
no
objection
to
this
.
What
they
have
objected object%2:32:00::
to
is be%2:42:03::
the
attempt
of
the
Russians
to
make make%2:41:00::
use
of
the
tragedy
of
Dag_Hammarskjold
's
death
to
turn turn_into%2:42:00::
the
entire
U._N.
staff
from
the
Secretary
down
into
political
agents
of
the
respective
countries
from
which
they
come come%2:42:09::
.
The
controversy
now
revolves revolve_around%2:42:00::
mainly
around
the
number
and
geographic
origin
of
the
deputies
of
the
Secretary_General
and
,
more
particularly
,
around
the
nature
of
his
relationship
with
them
.
Although
the
United_States
and
the
U._S._S._R.
have
been
arguing argue%2:32:00::
whether
there
shall
be be%2:42:04::
four
,
five
or
six
top
assistants
,
the_most
important
element
in
the
situation
is be%2:42:03::
not
the
number
of
deputies
but
the
manner
in_which
these
deputies
are
to
do do%2:41:04::
their
work
.
If
any
one
of
them
has have%2:40:00::
any
power
to
veto veto%2:32:00::
the
Secretary_General
's
decisions
the
nature
of
the
organization
will
have
changed change%2:30:00::
.
If
they
give give%2:40:03::
him
advice
when
he
asks ask%2:32:01::
it
,
or
if
they
perform perform%2:41:02::
specified
duties
under
his
direction
,
the
nature
of
the
U._N.
will
not
of_necessity
change change%2:30:00::
.
The
Secretary_General
must
have have%2:40:00::
,
subject_to
the
constitutional
direction
of
the
Security_Council
and
the
General_Assembly
,
the
power
to
act act%2:41:00::
,
to
propose propose%2:32:00::
action
and
to
organize organize%2:31:00::
action
without
being
hobbled hobble%2:41:00::
by
advisers
and
assistants
acting_on act_on%2:41:00::
someone
else
's
instructions
.
This
is be%2:42:03::
the
root
issue
for
which
the
United_States
should
stand stand%2:42:00::
.
We
should
not
become become%2:30:00::
confused
or
let let%2:41:00::
our
public
become become%2:30:00::
confused
over
irrelevant
questions
of
number
or
even
of
geography
.
What
we
must
have have%2:40:00::
,
if
the
United_Nations
is
to
survive survive%2:42:01::
,
is be%2:42:03::
as
nonpolitical
,
nonpartisan
an
organization
at
the
top
as
human_beings
can
make make%2:30:00::
it
,
subject_to
no
single
nation
's
direction
and
subservient
to
no
single
nation
's
ambition
.
The
new
City_Charter
,
which
should
get get%2:30:03::
a
Yes
vote
as
Question
No.
1
on
Nov.
7
,
would
not
make make%2:36:00::
a
good
Mayor
out
of
a
bad
one
.
There
is be%2:42:04::
no
such
magic
in
man-made
laws
.
But
it
would
greatly
strengthen strengthen%2:30:01::
any
Mayor
's
executive
powers
,
remove remove%2:30:00::
the
excuse
in
large
degree
that
he
is be%2:42:03::
a
captive
of
inaction
in
the
Board
of
Estimate
,
increase increase%2:30:02::
his
budget-making
authority
both
as
to
expense

and
vest vest%2:41:00::
in
him
the
right
to
reorganize reorganize%2:41:00::

the
interest

Lawmaking
power
is
removed remove%2:30:00::
from
the
Board
of
Estimate
and
made make%2:30:00::
a
partnership
responsibility
of
the
City_Council
and
the
Mayor
.
Thus
there
is be%2:42:04::
a
clearer
division
of
authority
,
administrative
and
legislative
.
The
board
is
diminished diminish%2:30:04::
in

over
zoning
,
franchises
,
pier
leases
,
sale
,
leasing
and
assignment
of

The

will
be be%2:42:03::

decrease decrease%2:30:01::
,
add add%2:30:00::
or
eliminate eliminate%2:30:01::
budget_items

subject_to
the
Mayor
's
veto
;
but
the
City_Council
will
now
share share%2:40:02::
fully
this
budget-altering
power
.
Overriding
of
mayoral
veto
on
budget
changes
will
require require%2:42:00::
concurrence
by
board
and
Council
,
and
a
two-thirds
vote
.
The
Controller
retains retain%2:40:01::

He

On
net
balance
,
in_spite_of
Controller_Gerosa
's
opposition
to
the
new
Charter
as
an
invasion
of
his
office
,
the
Controller
will
have have%2:40:00::
the
opportunity
for

Some

The
capital

for
construction
of
permanent

becomes become%2:30:00::
an
appropriating
document

just
a

as

According

There
is be%2:42:04::
room

some
of
Dr._Conant

His

Dr._Conant

His

what

as

But
these
are be%2:42:03::
side
issues
to
a
powerful
central
theme
.
That
theme
cuts cut%2:35:00::
through
hypocrisies
,
complacency
and
double-talk
.
It
labels label%2:32:00::
the
slums

the
Negro
slums

as
dead-end_streets
for
hundreds

piece
are be%2:42:03::
those
who
deny deny%2:40:00::
job
opportunities

these
youngsters

and
Dr._Conant
accuses accuse%2:32:00::
employers

The
facts

he
adds add%2:32:01::
,
are

from
public

by
squeamish
objections
to
calling call%2:32:02::

by
insistence

A
call

from
a
man
who
,
in

cautioned caution%2:32:00::
