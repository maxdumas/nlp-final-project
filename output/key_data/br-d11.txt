no

can
be be%2:42:03::
forthcoming
than
the

Yet

to

the

I
mean mean%2:32:01::
,
however
,
that
the
moral
theologian
knows know%2:31:03::
what
he
means mean%2:32:01::
by
``
permit permit%2:32:00::
''
.
He
is
not
talking talk_about%2:32:00::
in_the_main
about
probabilities
,
risks
and
danger
in_general
.
He
is
talking_about talk_about%2:32:00::
an
action
which
just_as
efficaciously
does do%2:36:01::
an
evil
thing
(
and
is be%2:42:03::
known
certainly
and
unavoidably
to
lead lead%2:42:12::
to
this
evil
result
)
as
it
efficaciously
does do%2:36:01::
some
good
.
He
is
talking_about talk_about%2:32:00::
double
effects
,
of_which
the
specific
action
causes cause%2:36:00::
directly
the
one
and
indirectly
the
other
,
but
causes cause%2:36:00::
both
;
of_which
one
is
deliberately
willed will%2:31:01::
or
intended intend%2:31:00::
and
the
other
not
intended intend%2:31:00::
or
not
directly
intended intend%2:31:00::
,
but
still
both
are
done do%2:36:01::
,
while
the
evil
effect
is
,
with
equal
consciousness
on
the
part
of
the
agent
,
foreknown foreknow%2:31:00::
to
be be%2:42:04::
among
the
consequences
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
what
,
in
a
technical
sense
,
to
``
only
permit permit%2:32:00::
''
an
evil
result
means mean%2:32:03::
.
It
means mean%2:32:03::
to
do do%2:41:01::
it
and
to
know know%2:31:01::
one
is
doing do%2:41:01::
it
,
but
as
only
a
secondary
if
certain
effect
of
the
good
one
primarily
does do%2:36:01::
and
intends intend%2:31:00::
.
Of_course
,
grave
guiltiness
may
be
imputed impute%2:31:00::
to
the
military_action
of
any
nation
,
or
to
the
action
of
any
leader
or
leaders
,
which
for
any
supposed
good
``
permits permit%2:32:00::
''
,
in_this
sense
,
the
termination
of
the
human_race
by
human_action
.
Certainly
,
in
analyzing analyze%2:31:00::
an
action
which
truly
faced face%2:33:00::
such
alternatives
,
``
it
is be%2:42:03::
never
possible
that
no
world
would
be be%2:42:03::
preferable
to
some
worlds
,
and
there
are be%2:42:00::
in_truth
no
circumstances
in_which
the
destruction
of
human
life
presents present%2:32:00::
itself
as
a
reasonable
alternative
''
.
Naturally
,
where
one
or
the
other
of
the
effects
of
an
action
is be%2:42:03::
uncertain
,
this
has
to
be
taken_into_account take_into_account%2:31:00::
.
Especially
is be%2:42:03::
this
true
when
,
because
the
good
effect
is be%2:42:03::
remote
and
speculative
while
the
evil
is be%2:42:03::
certain
and
grave
,
the
action
is
prohibited prohibit%2:32:00::
.
Presumably
,
if
the
reverse
is be%2:42:06::
the
case
and
the
good
effect
is be%2:42:03::
more
certain
than
the
evil
result
that
may
be be%2:42:03::
forthcoming
,
not_only
must
the
good
and
the
evil
be
prudentially
weighed weigh%2:32:00::
and
found find%2:32:00::
proportionate
,
but
also
calculation
of
the
probabilities
and
of
the
degree
of
certainty
or
uncertainty
in
the
good
or
evil
effect
must
be
taken_into_account take_into_account%2:31:00::
.
There
must_not must_not%2:42:00::
only
be be%2:42:00::
greater
good
than
evil
objectively
in_view
,
but
also
greater
probability
of
actually
doing do%2:41:01::
more
good
than
harm
.
If
an
evil
which
is be%2:42:03::
certain
and
extensive
and
immediate
may
rarely
be
compensated compensate%2:42:00::
for
by
a
problematic
,
speculative
,
future
good
,
by
the
same
token
not
every
present
,
certain
,
and
immediate
good
(
or
lesser
evil
)
that
may
have have%2:42:05::
to
be
done do%2:36:01::
will
be
outweighed outweigh%2:33:00::
by
a
problematic
,
speculative
,
and
future
evil
.
Nevertheless
,
according accord%2:42:00::
to
the
traditional
theory
,
a
man
begins begin%2:30:00::
in_the_midst
of
action
and
he
analyzes analyze%2:31:00::
its
nature
and
immediate
cosequences
before
or
while
putting put%2:35:05::
it
forth
and
causing cause%2:36:00::
these
consequences
.
He
does
not
expect expect%2:31:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
able
to
trammel_up
all
the
future
consequences
of
his
action
.
Above_all
,
he
does
not
debate debate%2:32:02::
mere
contingencies
,
and
therefore
,
if
these
are be%2:42:03::
possibly
dreadful
,
find find%2:39:01::
himself
forced force%2:41:00::
into
inaction
.
He
does do%2:41:01::
what
he
can
and
may
and
must
,
without
regarding regard%2:31:00::
himself
as
lord
of
the
future
or
,
on_the_other_hand
,
as
covered cover%2:42:01::
with
guilt
by_accident
or
unforeseen
consequences
or
by
results
he
did
not
``
permit permit%2:32:00::
''
in
the
sense
explained explain%2:32:00::
.
By
contrast
,
a
good_deal
of
nuclear
pacifism
begins begin%2:30:00::
with
the
contingencies
and
the
probabilities
,
and
not
with
the
moral
nature
of
the
action
to
be
done do%2:41:01::
;
and
by
deriving derive%2:31:00::
legitimate
decision
backward
from
whatever
may
conceivably
or
possibly
or
probably
result
,
whether
by
anyone
's
doing do%2:41:01::
or
by_accident
,
it
finds find%2:39:01::
itself
driven drive%2:36:00::
to
inaction
,
to
non-political
action
in
politics
and
non-military
action
in
military
affairs
,
and
to
the
not
very
surprising
discovery
that
there
are be%2:42:00::
now
no
distinctions
on_which
the
defense
of
justice
can
possibly
be
based base%2:31:00::
.
Mr._Philip_Toynbee
writes write%2:36:00::
,
for_example
,
that
``
in_terms_of
probability
it
is be%2:42:03::
surely
as
likely
as
not
that
mutual
fear
will
lead lead%2:42:12::
to
accidental
war
in
the
near
future
if
the
present
situation
continues continue%2:42:01::
.
If
it
continues continue%2:42:01::
indefinitely
it
is be%2:42:03::
nearly
a
statistical
certainty
that
a
mistake
will
be
made make%2:41:00::
and
that
the
devastation
will
begin begin%2:30:00::
''
.
Against
such
a
termination
of
human
life
on
earth
by
human_action
,
he
then
proposes propose%2:32:00::
as_an_alternative
that
we
``
negotiate negotiate%2:32:00::
at_once
with
the
Russians
and
get get%2:40:00::
the
best
terms
which
are be%2:42:03::
available
''
,
that
we
deliberately
``
negotiate negotiate%2:32:00::
from
comparative
weakness
''
.
He
bravely
attempts attempt%2:41:00::
to
face face%2:33:00::
this
alternative
realistically
,
i.
e.
,
by
considering consider%2:39:00::
the
worst
possible
outcome
,
namely
,
the
total
domination
of
the
world
by
Russia
within
a_few
years
.
This
would
be be%2:42:06::
by_far
the
better
choice
,
when
``
it
is be%2:42:06::
a
question
of
allowing allow%2:41:00::
the
human_race
to
survive survive%2:42:00::
,
possibly
under
the
domination
of
a
regime
which
most_of
us
detest detest%2:37:00::
,
or
of
allowing allow%2:41:00::
it
to
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
itself
in
appalling
and
prolonged
anguish
''
.
Nevertheless
,
the
consequence
of
the
policy
proposed propose%2:32:00::
is be%2:42:03::
everywhere
subtly
qualified
:
it
is be%2:42:03::
``
a
possible
result
,
however
improbable
''
;
``
the
worst
,
and
least
probable
''
result
;
``
if
it
did
n't
prevail prevail%2:42:00::
mankind
would
still
be
given give%2:40:03::
the
opportunity
of
prevailing prevail%2:42:00::
''
;
for
``
surely
anything
is be%2:42:03::
better
than
a
policy
which
allows_for allow_for%2:42:00::
the
possibility
of
nuclear
war
''
.
If
we
have
not
thought think%2:31:00::
and
made make%2:41:00::
a
decision
entirely
in
these
terms
,
then
we
need need%2:42:01::
to
submit submit%2:33:00::
ourselves
to
the
following
``
simple
test
''
:
``
Have
we
decided decide%2:31:00::
how
we
are
to
kill kill%2:35:00::
the
other
members
of
our
household
in
the
event
of
our
being be%2:42:03::
less
injured
than
they
are be%2:42:03::
''
?
Thus
,
moral
decision
must
be
entirely
deduced deduce%2:31:00::
backward
from
the
likely
eventuality
;
it
is be%2:42:03::
no_longer
to
be
formulated formulate%2:32:03::
in_terms_of
the
nature
of
present
action
itself
,
its
intention
,
and
proximate
effect

the

to
be
done do%2:36:01::
.
Several
