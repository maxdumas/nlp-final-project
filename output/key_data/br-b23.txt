Everywhere
I
went go%2:38:00::
in
Formosa
I
asked ask%2:32:00::
the
same
question
.
I
was
searching search%2:35:00::
for
an
accent
of
self-delusion
or
,
even
,
of
hypocrisy
.
I
never
found find%2:40:02::
it
among
any
of
the
Chinese
with
whom
I
spoke speak%2:32:01::
,
though
granted
they
were be%2:42:03::
,
almost
all
,
members
of
the
official
family
who
,
presumably
,
harbor harbor%2:37:00::
official
thoughts
.
But
I
questioned question%2:32:09::
,
also
,
professional
soldiers
,
who
would
not
easily
be
hypnotized hypnotize%2:29:00::
by
a
septuagenarian
's
dreamy
irredentism
.
Their
answer
was be%2:42:06::
:
it
can
be
done do%2:36:01::
,
and
we
will
do do%2:36:01::
it
.
And_then
I
put put%2:32:00::
the
question
as
pointedly
as
I
could
directly
to
Chiang_Kai-shek
:
``
In
America
''
,
I
said say%2:32:00::
,
``
practically
no
one
believes believe%2:31:00::
that
you
subjectively
intend intend%2:31:00::
to
re-enter re-enter%2:38:00::
the
Mainland
.
What
evidence
is
there
of
an
objective
kind
that
in_fact
your
government
proposes propose%2:31:01::
to
do do%2:36:01::
just
that
,
and
that
it
can
be
done do%2:36:01::
''
?
He
smiled smile%2:29:00::
.
(
He
always
smiles smile%2:29:00::
-
at_least
at
visitors
,
I
gather gather%2:32:00::
.
He
smiled smile%2:29:00::
also
at
a
British
bloke
seated seat%2:35:00::
next
to
me
,
who
asked ask%2:32:00::
the_most
asinine
questions
.
I
recalled recall%2:31:00::
sympathetically
the
Duke
's
complaint
in
Browning
's
``
My
Last
Duchess
''
.
He
smiled smile%2:29:00::
,
and
said say%2:32:00::
a
word
or
two
to
the
interpreter
,
who
turned_to turn_to%2:32:01::
me
,
``
The
President
wonders wonder%2:31:00::

,
I
smarted smart%2:39:00::
,
is be%2:42:06::
a
royal
rebuff
if
ever
there
was
one

I
answered answer%2:32:00::
the
routine
question
about
my
itinerary

rather
coolly

Chiang
spoke speak%2:32:00::
again

that
the

On

The

They
think think%2:31:09::
,
perforce
,
of
physical
survival
:
everything
else
is be%2:42:03::
secondary

But
the
army
which
Mao
continues continue%2:32:00::
to
feed feed%2:34:04::
well
,
where
are be%2:42:04::
its
sympathies
?
The
psychological
strategists

stress stress%2:32:00::
the
great
sense

cultivated cultivate%2:36:00::
in

thousands
of
years

It
has
not
been
extirpated extirpate%2:36:00::
by
ten
years
of
Communist
depersonalization

Every
soldier
in
the
army
has have%2:40:00::
,
somewhere
,
relatives
who
are be%2:42:03::
close_to
starvation

The
soldiers
themselves
cannot
stage stage%2:36:01::
a
successful
rebellion
,
it
is
assumed assume%2:31:00::
:
but
will
their
discontent
spread spread%2:35:00::
to
the
officer
class
?
The
immediate
families
of
the
generals
and
the
admirals
are be%2:42:03::
well_fed
:
a
despot
does
not
economize economize%2:40:00::
on
his
generals

But
there
are
the
cousins

aunts

Their
privations

almost
beyond
endurance

as
understood understand%2:31:03::
by

To

There
is
little
doubt

they
had have%2:40:04::
a
secret

they
would
vote vote%2:41:13::
for
food
for
their
family
,
in_place
of
ideological
purity
out
on
the
farm
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
another
question
whether
``
they
''
-
or
a
single
general
,
off
in
a
corner
of
China
,
secure
for
a_few
(
galvanizing
?
)
days
at_least
from
instant
retaliation
-
will
defy defy%2:42:00::
the
Party
.
But
the
disposition
to
rebel rebel%2:41:00::
is be%2:42:03::
most
definitely
there
.
But
there
must
be be%2:42:04::
a
catalytic
pressure
.
The
military
in
Taiwan
believe believe%2:31:04::
that
the
Communists
have
made make%2:36:08::
two
mistakes
,
which
,
together
,
may
prove prove%2:42:00::
fatal
.
The
first
was be%2:42:06::
the
commune
program
,
which
will
ensure ensure%2:32:00::
agricultural
poverty
for
years
.
The
family
is be%2:42:03::
largely
broken_up
;
and
where
it
is be%2:42:03::
not
,
it
is
left leave%2:42:02::
with
no
residue
,
and
the
social
meaning
of_this
is be%2:42:03::
enormous
.
For
it
is be%2:42:06::
the
family
that
,
in
China
,
has
always
provided provide%2:40:00::
social_security
for
the
indigent
,
the
sick
,
the
down-and-out
members
of
the
clan
.
Now
the
government
must
do do%2:36:01::
that
;
but
the
government
is
left leave%2:42:02::
with
no
reserve
granary
,
under
the
agricultural
system
it
has
ordained ordain%2:41:01::
.
Thus
the
government
simultaneously
undertook undertake%2:36:00::
the
vast
burden
of
social_security
which
had
traditionally
been
privately
discharged discharge%2:35:00::
,
and
created create%2:36:00::
a
national
scarcity
which
has
engendered engender%2:36:00::
calamitous
problems
of
social_security
.
The
second
mistake
is be%2:42:06::
Tibet
.
Tibet
has
historically
served serve%2:42:03::
China
as
a
buffer_state
.
A
friendly
state
,
sometimes
only
semi-independent
,
but
never
hostile
.
China
never
tried try%2:41:00::
to
integrate integrate%2:30:00::
Tibet
by
extirpating extirpate%2:36:00::
the
people
's
religion
and
institutions
.
Red_China
is
trying try%2:41:00::
to
do do%2:36:01::
this
,
and
she
is be%2:42:03::
not
likely
ever
to
succeed succeed%2:41:00::
.
Tibet
is be%2:42:03::
too
vast
,
the
terrain
is be%2:42:03::
too
difficult
.
Tibet
may
bleed bleed%2:29:01::
China
as
Algeria
is
bleeding bleed%2:29:01::
France
.
These
continuing
pressures
,
social
,
economic
and
military
,
are
doing do%2:36:01::
much
to
keep keep%2:42:00::
China
in
a
heightening
state
of
tension
.
The
imposition
of
yet
another
pressure
,
a
strong
one
,
from_the_outside
,
might
cause cause%2:36:00::
it
to
snap snap%2:35:01::
.
The
planners
in
Taiwan
struck strike%2:37:00::
me
as
realistic
men
.
They
know know%2:31:01::
that
they
must
depend depend%2:42:00::
heavily
on
factors
outside
their
own
control
.
First_and_foremost
,
they
depend_on depend_on%2:42:00::
the
inhuman
idiocies
of
the
Communist
regime
.
On
these
they
feel feel%2:31:00::
they
can
rely rely_on%2:31:01::
.
Secondly
,
they
depend_on depend_on%2:42:00::
America
's
``
moral
cooperation
''
when
the
crucial
moment
arrives arrive%2:38:00::
.
They
hope hope%2:37:00::
that
if
history
vouchsafes vouchsafe%2:40:00::
the
West
another
Budapest
,
we
will
receive receive%2:35:00::
the
opportunity
gladly
.
I
remarked remark%2:32:00::
jocularly
to
the
President
that
the
future
of
China
would
be be%2:42:03::
far
more
certain
if
he
would
invite invite%2:41:01::
a
planeload
of
selected
American
Liberals
to
Quemoy
on
an
odd
day
.
He
affected affect%2:32:00::
(
most
properly
)
not
to
understand understand%2:31:00::
my
point
.
But
he
-
and
all_of
China
-
wear wear%2:29:04::
the
scars
of
American
indecisiveness
,
and
he
knows know%2:31:01::
what
an
uncertain
ally
we
are be%2:42:03::
.
We
have
been be%2:42:03::
grand
to
Formosa
itself
-
lots_of
aid
,
and
,
most_of
the
time
,
a
policy
of
support
for
the
offshore
islands
.
But
our
outlook
has
been be%2:42:03::
,
and
continues continue%2:42:01::
to
be be%2:42:03::
,
defensive
.
A
great_deal
depends_on depend_on%2:42:00::
the
crystallization
of
Mr._Kennedy
's
views
on
the
world
struggle
.
The
Free
Chinese
know know%2:31:01::
that
the
situation
on
the
Mainland
is be%2:42:03::
in
flux
,
and
are
poised poise%2:38:00::
to
strike strike%2:33:00::
.
There
is
not_anywhere
on
the
frontiers
of
freedom
a
more
highly
mobilized
force
for
liberation
.
The
moment
of
truth
is be%2:42:06::
the
moment
of
crisis
.
During
the
slow
buildup
,
the
essence
of
a
policy
or
a
man
is
concealed conceal%2:39:01::
under
embroidered
details
,
fine
words
,
strutting
gestures
.
The
crisis
burns burn%2:30:02::
these
suddenly
away
.
There
the
truth
is be%2:42:04::
,
open_to
eyes
that
are be%2:42:03::
willing
to
look look%2:39:00::
.
The
moment
passes pass%2:38:03::
.
New
self-deceiving
rags
are
hurriedly
tossed toss%2:35:05::
on
the
too-naked
bones
.
A
truth-revealing
crisis
erupted erupt%2:30:01::
in
Katanga
for
a_couple_of
days
this
month
,
to
be
quickly
smothered smother%2:35:02::
by
the
high_pressure
verbal
fog
that_is
kept keep%2:42:00::
on_tap
for
such
emergencies
.
Before
memory
,
too
,
clouds_over cloud_over%2:43:00::
,
let
us
make make%2:36:00::
a
note
or
two
of_what
could
be
seen see%2:39:00::
.
The
measure
was
instantly
taken take%2:31:09::
,
as
always
in
such
cases
,
of
public
men
at
many
levels
.
One
knows know%2:31:01::
better
,
now
,
who
has have%2:40:04::
bone
and
who
has have%2:40:04::
jelly
in
his
spine
.
But
I
am be%2:42:03::
here
concerned
more
with
policy
than
with
men
.
Public
men
come come%2:38:04::
and
go go%2:38:01::
but
great
issues
of
policy
remain remain%2:42:03::
.
Now
,
everyone
knows know%2:31:01::
-
or
knew know%2:31:01::
in
the
week
of
December
10
-
that
something
had
gone go_wrong%2:41:00::
shockingly
wrong
with
American
foreign_policy
.
The
United_States
was
engaged engage%2:41:06::
in
a
military
attack
on
a
peaceful
,
orderly
people
governed govern%2:41:02::
by
a
regime
that
had
proved prove%2:42:00::
itself
the_most
pro-Western
and
anti-Communist
within
any
of
the
new
nations
-
the
only
place
in
Africa
,
moreover
,
where
a
productive
relationship
between
whites
and
blacks
had
apparently
been
achieved achieve%2:41:00::
.
Of_course
the
fighting
was be%2:42:03::
officially
under
the
auspices
of
the
United_Nations
.
But
in
the
moment
of
truth
everyone
could
see see%2:31:01::
that
the
U._S.
was be%2:42:06::
in_reality
the
principal
.
The
moment
simultaneously
revealed reveal%2:32:00::
that
in
the
crisis
our
policy
ran run%2:42:04::
counter
to_that
of
all
our
NATO
allies
,
to
the
entire
Western
community
.
By
our
policy
the
West
was be%2:42:03::
-
is be%2:42:03::
-
split
.
But
the
key
revelation
is be%2:42:03::
not
new
.
The
controlling
pattern
was
first
displayed display%2:39:01::
in
the
Hungary-Suez
crisis
of
November
1956
.
It
reappears reappear%2:30:00::
,
in
whole
or
part
,
whenever
a
new
crisis
exposes expose%2:39:00::
the
reality
:
in
Cuba
last
spring
(
with
which
the
Dominican
events
of
last
month
should
be
paired pair%2:35:01::
)
;
at
the
peaks
of
the
nuclear
test
and
the
Berlin
cycles
;
in_relation_to
Laos
,
Algeria
,
South_Africa
;
right_now
,
with
almost
cartoon
emphasis
,
in
the
temporally
linked
complex
of
Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana
.
This
prime
element
of
the
truth
may
be
stated state%2:32:00::
as_follows
:
Under
prevailing
policy
,
the
U._S.
can
take take%2:41:04::
the
initiative
against
the
Right
,
but
cannot
take take%2:41:04::
the
initiative
against
the
Left
.
It
makes make%2:30:00::
no
difference
what
part
of
the
world
is be%2:42:03::
involved
,
what
form
of
regime
,
what
particular
issue
.
The
U._S.
cannot
take take%2:41:04::
the
initiative
against
the
Left
.
There
is be%2:42:03::
even
some
question
whether
the
U._S.
can
any
longer
defend defend%2:33:05::
itself
against
an
initiative
by
the
Left
.
We
can
attack attack%2:33:00::
Tshombe
,
but
not
Gigenza
.
No_matter
that
Gizenga
is be%2:42:06::
Moscow
's
man
in
the
Congo
.
No_matter
that
it
is be%2:42:06::
his
troops
who
rape rape%2:41:00::
Western
women
and
eat eat%2:34:02::
Western
men
.
No_matter
that
the
Katanga
operation
is be%2:42:03::

interests

Most
immediately
relevant
to

is be%2:42:06::
