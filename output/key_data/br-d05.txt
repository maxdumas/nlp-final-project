as

The
Unitarian
clergy
were be%2:42:06::
an
exclusive
club
of
cultivated
gentlemen
-
as
the
term
was
then
understood understand%2:31:00::
in_the_Back
Bay
-
and
Parker
was be%2:42:03::
definitely
not
a
gentleman
,
either
in
theology
or
in
manners
.
Ezra_Stiles_Gannett
,
an
honorable
representative
of
the
sanhedrin
,
addressed address%2:34:00::
himself
frankly
to
the
issue
in
1845
,
insisting insist%2:32:00::
that
Parker
should
not
be
persecuted persecute%2:41:00::
or
calumniated calumniate%2:32:00::
and
that
in_this
republic
no
power
to
restrain restrain%2:41:01::
him
by
force
could
exist exist%2:42:00::
.
Even_so
,
Gannett
judiciously
argued argue%2:32:02::
,
the
Association
could
legitimately
decide decide%2:31:00::
that
Parker
``

not
be

assisted assist%2:41:02::
in

from

We
today
are be%2:42:03::
not
entitled
to
excoriate excoriate%2:32:00::
honest
men
who
believed believe%2:31:04::
Parker
to
be be%2:42:03::
downright
pernicious
and
who
barred bar%2:35:01::
their
pulpits
against
his
demand
to
poison poison%2:41:00::
the
minds
of
their
congregations
.
One
can
even
argue argue%2:32:02::
-
though
this
is be%2:42:06::
a
delicate
matter
-
that
every
justification
existed exist%2:42:00::
for

returning return%2:40:08::

propaganda
when
his
turn
should
come come%2:30:01::
to

Finally
,
it
did
seem seem%2:39:00::
clear
as
day
to
these
clergymen
,
as
Gannett
's
son
explained explain%2:32:00::
in
the
biography
of
his
father
,
they
had
always
contended contend%2:33:00::
for
the
propriety
of
their
claim
to
the
title
of
Christians

Their
demand
against
the
Calvinist_Orthodoxy
for
intellectual
liberty
had
never
meant mean%2:32:01::
that
they
would
follow follow%2:40:00::
``
free

to
the
extreme
of
proclaiming proclaim%2:32:02::
Christianity
a
``
natural

religion

Grant
all
this
-
still
,
when
modern
Unitarianism
and
the
Harvard_Divinity_School
recall recall%2:31:00::
with
humorous
affection
the
insults
Parker
lavished lavish%2:40:00::
upon

Whenever
New_England
liberalism
is
reminded remind%2:32:00::
of
the
dramatic
confrontation
of
Parker
and
the
fraternity
on
January
23
,
1843
-
while
it
may
defend defend%2:32:00::
the
privilege
of
Chandler_Robbins
to
demand demand%2:32:00::
that
Parker
leave leave%2:41:00::
the
Association
,
while
it
may
plead plead%2:32:03::
that
Dr._N._L._Frothingham
had have%2:40:00::
every
warrant
for
stating state%2:32:00::
,
``

the
Association
is be%2:42:06::
a
difference
between
no
Christianity
and
Christianity
''
-
despite
these
supposed
conclusive
assurances
,
the
modern
liberal
heaves heave%2:32:00::
repeatedly
a
sigh
of
relief
,
of
positive
thanksgiving
,
that
the
Association
never
quite
brought bring_oneself%2:41:00::
itself
officially
to
expel expel%2:35:00::
Parker
.
Had
it
done
so
,
the
blot
on
its
escutcheon
would
have
remained remain%2:30:00::
indelible
,
nor
could
the
Harvard_Divinity_School
assemble assemble%2:41:00::
today
to
honor honor%2:41:00::
Parker
's
insurgence
other_than
by
getting_down get_down%2:38:02::
on
its
collective
knees
and
crying cry%2:32:01::
``
peccavi
''
.
Happily
for
posterity
,
then
,
the
Boston_Association
did
not
actually
command command%2:32:00::
Parker
to
leave leave%2:38:00::
the
room
,
though
it
came come%2:38:04::
too_close
for
comfort
to
what
would
have
been be%2:42:06::
an
unforgivable
brutality
.
Fortunately
,
the
honor
of
the
denomination
can
attest attest%2:32:01::
that
Cyrus_Bartol
defended defend%2:32:00::
Parker
's
sincerity
,
as
did
also
Gannett
and
Chandler_Robbins
;
whereupon
Parker
broke_down break_down%2:37:00::
into
convulsions
of
weeping
and
rushed rush%2:38:00::
out
of
the
room
,
though
not
out
of
the
Fellowship
.
In
the
hall
,
after
adjournment
,
Dr._Frothingham
took take%2:35:00::
him
warmly
by
the
hand
and
requested request%2:32:02::
Parker
to
visit visit%2:41:00::
him
-
whereupon
our
burly
Theodore
again
burst burst%2:37:00::
into
tears
.
All
this
near
tragedy
,
which
to
us
borders_on border_on%2:42:00::
comedy
,
enables enable%2:30:00::
us
to
tell tell%2:32:01::
the
story
over_and_over_again
,
always
warming warm%2:30:01::
ourselves
with
a
glow
of
complacency
.
It
was be%2:42:06::
indeed
a
near
thing
,
but
somehow
the
inherent
decency
of
New_England
(
which
we
inherit inherit%2:40:00::
)
did
triumph triumph%2:33:00::
.
Parker
was
never
excommunicated excommunicate%2:32:00::
.
To
the
extent
that
he
was
ostracized ostracize%2:41:01::
or
even
reviled revile%2:32:00::
,
we
solace solace%2:37:00::
ourselves
by
saying say%2:32:01::
he
asked_for ask_for%2:37:00::
it
.
Yet
,
even
after_all
these
stratagems
,
the
conscience
of
Christian
liberality
is
still
not
laid_to_rest lay_to_rest%2:41:00::
,
any_more
than
is
the
conscience
of
Harvard_University
for
having
done do%2:41:01::
the
abject
penance
for
its
rejection
of
Ralph_Waldo_Emerson
's
The
Divinity_School_Address
of
naming name%2:32:03::
its
hall
of
philosophy
after
him
.
In
both
cases
the
stubborn
fact
remains remain%2:42:05::
:
liberalism
gave_birth give_birth%2:36:00::
to
two
brilliant
apostates
,
both
legitimate
offspring
of
its
loins
,
and
when
brought bring%2:35:04::
to
the
test
,
it
behaved behave%2:29:00::
shabbily
.
Suppose suppose%2:31:01::
they
both
had
ventured venture%2:41:01::
into
realms
which
their
colleagues
thought think%2:31:01::
infidel
:
is be%2:42:06::
this
the
way
gentlemen
settle settle%2:31:00::
frank
differences_of_opinion
?
Is be%2:42:03::
it
after_all
possible
that
no_matter_how
the
liberals
trumpet trumpet%2:32:00::
their
confidence
in
human
dignity
they
are
exposed expose%2:39:02::
to
a
contagion
of
fear
more
insidious
than
any
conservative
has
ever
to
worry worry%2:37:00::
about
?
However
,
there
is be%2:42:00::
a
crucial
difference
between
the
two
histories
.
Emerson
evaded evade%2:32:00::
the
problem
by
shoving shove%2:35:00::
it
aside
,
or
rather
by
leaving leave_behind%2:38:00::
it
behind
him
:
he
walked_out_of walk_out_of%2:38:00::
the
Unitarian
communion
,
so_that
it
could
lick lick%2:35:00::
the
wound
of
his
departure
,
preserve preserve%2:40:00::
its
self-respect
and
eventually
accord accord%2:40:00::
him
pious
veneration
.
Parker
insisted insist%2:32:00::
upon
not
resigning resign%2:41:00::
,
even
when
the
majority
wanted want%2:37:00::
him
to
depart depart%2:38:04::
,
upon
daring dare%2:32:00::
the
Fellowship
to
throw throw_out%2:41:00::
him
out
.
Hence
he
was be%2:42:03::
in
his
lifetime
,
as
is be%2:42:03::
the
memory
of
him
afterwards
,
a
canker
within
the
liberal
sensitivity
.
He
still
points point%2:33:00::
an
accusing
finger
at_all
of
us
,
telling tell%2:32:00::
us
we
have have%2:40:00::
neither
the
courage
to
support support%2:41:00::
him
nor
the
energy
to
cut cut%2:35:00::
his
throat
.
Actually
,
the
dispute
between
Parker
and
the
society
of
his
time
,
both
ecclesiastical
and
social
,
was be%2:42:03::
a
real
one
,
a
bitter
one
.
It
cannot
be
smoothed_over smooth_over%2:41:00::
by
now
cherishing cherish%2:37:00::
his
sarcasms
as
delightful
bits
of
self-deprecation
or
by
solemnly
calling_for call_for%2:32:04::
a
reconsideration
of
the
justice
of
the
objections
to
him
.
The
fact
is be%2:42:03::
incontestable
:
that
liberal
world
of
Unitarian_Boston
was be%2:42:03::
narrow-minded
,
intellectually
sterile
,
smug
,
afraid_of
the
logical
consequences
of
its
own
mild
ventures
into
iconoclasm
,
and
quite
prepared
to
resort resort%2:41:11::
to
hysterical
repressions
when
its
brittle
foundations
were
threatened threaten%2:42:00::
.
Parker
,
along
with
Garrison
and
Charles_Sumner
,
showed show%2:32:02::
a
magnificent
moral
bravery
when
facing face%2:33:00::
mobs
mobilized mobilize%2:33:01::
in
defense
of
the
Mexican
War
and
slavery
.
Nevertheless
,
we
can
find find%2:36:00::
reasons
for
respecting respect%2:31:00::
even
the
bigotry
of
the
populace
;
their
passions
were be%2:42:03::
genuine
,
and
the
division
between
them
and
the
abolitionists
is be%2:42:03::
clear-cut
.
But
Parker
as
the
ultra-liberal
minister
within
the
pale
of
a
church
which
had
proclaimed proclaim%2:32:02::
itself
the
repository
of
liberality
poses pose%2:42:00::
a
different
problem
,
which
is be%2:42:03::
not
to
be
resolved resolve%2:31:01::
by
holding hold_up%2:39:00::
him
up
as
the
champion
of
freedom
.
Even_though
his
theological
theses
have
become become%2:30:00::
,
to
us
,
commonplaces
,
the
fundamental
interrogation
he
phrased phrase%2:32:00::
is be%2:42:03::
very_much
with
us
.
It
has
been
endlessly
rephrased rephrase%2:32:00::
,
but
I
may
here
put put%2:32:00::
it
thus
:
at
what
point
do
the
tolerant
find find%2:31:10::
themselves
obliged oblige%2:41:00::
to
become become%2:30:00::
intolerant
?
And_then
,
as
they
become become%2:30:00::
aware
that
they
have
reached reach%2:38:00::
the
end
of
their
patience
,
what
do
they
,
to
their
dismay
,
learn learn%2:31:01::
for_the_first_time
about
themselves
?
There
can
be be%2:42:04::
no_doubt
,
the
Boston
of_that
era
could
be be%2:42:03::
exquisitely
cruel
in
enforcing enforce%2:41:00::
its
canons
of
behavior
.
The
gentle
Channing
,
revered revere%2:37:01::
by
all
Bostonians
,
orthodox
or
Unitarian
,
wrote write%2:32:00::
to
a
friend
in
Louisville
that
among
its
many
virtues
Boston
did
not
abound_in abound_in%2:42:00::
a
tolerant
spirit
,
that
the
yoke
of
opinion
crushed crush%2:41:00::
individuality
of
judgment
and
action
:
``
No
city
in
the
world
is
governed govern%2:41:00::
so
little
by
a
police
,
and
so_much
by

inspections
and
what
is
called call%2:32:02::
public
sentiment
.
We
stand stand%2:42:04::
more

most

runs run%2:42:01::
more

and
often

with
a
rod
of
iron
''
.
Even
more
poignantly
,
and
with
the
insight
of
a
genius
,
Channing
added add%2:32:01::
-
remember remember%2:31:01::
,
this
is be%2:42:06::
Channing
,
not
Parker

-
that
should
a
minister
in
Boston
trust trust%2:31:00::
himself
to
his
heart
,
should
he
``
speak speak%2:32:02::
without
book
,
and
consequently
break break%2:41:00::
some
law
of

,
or
be
hurried hurry%2:30:01::
into
some
daring
hyperbole
,
he
should
find find%2:30:00::
little
mercy
''
.
Channing
wrote write%2:36:00::
this
-
in
a
letter
!
I
think think%2:31:01::
it
fair
to
say say%2:32:03::
that
he
never
quite
reached reach%2:38:00::
such
candor
in
his
sermons
.
But
Theodore_Parker
,
commencing commence%2:36:00::
his
mission
to
the
world-at-large
,
disguised
as
the
minister
of
a
``
twenty-eighth
Congregational_Church
''
which
bore bear%2:42:01::
no
resemblance
to
the
Congregational
polities
descended descend%2:42:00::
from
the
founders
(
among
which
were be%2:42:04::
still
the
Unitarian
churches
)
,
made make%2:30:00::
explicit
from_the_beginning
that
the
conflict
between
him
and
the
Hunkerish
society
was be%2:42:03::
not
something
which
could
be
evaporated evaporate%2:30:00::
into
a
genteel
difference
about
clerical
decorum
.
Because
he
spoke speak%2:32:02::
openly
with
what
Channing
had
prophesied prophesy%2:32:00::
someone
might
-
with
daring
hyperbole
-
Parker
vindicated vindicate%2:32:00::
Channing
's
further
prophecy
that
he
who
committed commit%2:41:00::
this
infraction
of
taste
would
promptly
discover discover%2:31:01::
how
little

disposed
to

to
libertarians
who
appeared appear%2:39:00::
to

An
institutionalized
liberalism
proved prove%2:31:00::
itself
fundamentally
an
institution
,
and
only
within
those
defined
limits
a
license
.
By
reminding remind%2:31:00::
ourselves
of
these
factors
in
the
situation
,
we
should
,
I
am be%2:42:03::
sure
,
come_to come_to%2:39:00::
a
fresh
realization
,
however
painful
it
be be%2:42:03::
,
that
the
battle
between
Parker
and
his
neighbors
was
fought fight%2:33:01::
in_earnest
.
He
arraigned arraign%2:32:00::
the
citizens

so
little
courtesy
that
they
had have%2:42:05::
to
respond respond%2:31:00::

What
otherwise
could
``

do do%2:41:01::
