Probably
THE
hottest
thing
that
has
hit hit%2:35:05::
the
Dallas
investment
community
in
years
was be%2:42:06::
the
Morton
Foods_stock
issue
,
which
was
sold sell%2:40:00::
to
the
public
during
the
past
week
.
For
many
reasons
,
the
demand
to
buy buy%2:40:00::
shares
in
the
Dallas-headquartered
company
was be%2:42:03::
tremendous
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
not
a
case
of
the
investment_bankers
having
to
sell sell%2:40:00::
the
stock
;
it
was be%2:42:03::
more
one
of
allotting allot%2:40:00::
a_few
shares
to
a_number_of
customers
and
explaining explain%2:32:00::
to
others
why
they
had have%2:40:00::
no_more
to
sell sell%2:40:00::
.
Investors
who
wanted want%2:37:00::
100
shares
in
many
cases
ended_up end_up%2:30:00::
with
25
,
and
customers
who
had
put_in put_in%2:30:00::
a
bid
to
buy buy%2:40:00::
400

found find%2:39:01::
themselves
with
100
and
counted count%2:32:03::
themselves
lucky
to
get get%2:40:00::
that
many
.
In_fact
,
very_few
customers
,
anywhere
in
the
nation
,
were be%2:42:03::
able
to
get get%2:40:00::
more_than
100
shares
.
Some
Dallas
investment
firms
got get%2:40:00::
only
100
shares
,
for
all_of
their
customers
.
A
measure
of
how
hot
the
stock
was be%2:42:03::
,
can
be
found find%2:32:00::
in_what
happened happen%2:30:02::
to
it
on
the
market
as
soon
as
trading
began begin%2:30:00::
.
The
stock
was
sold sell%2:40:00::
in
the

a

of

And
from_that
the
stock
moved move_up%2:38:01::
right_on

until
it
was

Thursday
morning
at
around

But
the
Morton
Foods
issue
was be%2:42:03::
hot
long
before
it
was be%2:42:05::
on
the
market
.
Indeed
,
from
the
moment
the
reports
of
the
coming
issue
first
started start%2:30:00::
circulating circulate%2:32:01::
in

started start%2:30:00::

But
E._G._T.

But
the
result
of_it
all
was be%2:42:06::
,
E._G._T.
partner
Dean_Guerin
believes believe%2:31:04::
,
an
effective
distribution
of
the
stock
to
owners
all_over
the
nation
.
``
I
feel feel%2:37:00::
confident

'
,
he
said say%2:32:00::
,
meaning mean%2:31:01::
its

would
be
quoted quote%2:32:00::
regularly
in
newspapers
all_over
the
country
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
also
pleased
with
the
wide
distribution
because
he
thought think%2:31:01::
it
proved prove%2:32:00::
again
his
argument
that
Dallas
investment
men
can
do do%2:41:02::
just_as
good
a
job
as
the
big
New_York
investment_bankers
claim claim%2:32:00::
only
they
can
do do%2:41:02::
.
But
what
made make%2:30:00::
the
Morton
Foods_stock
issue
such
a
hot
one
?
The
answer
is be%2:42:06::
that
it
was be%2:42:06::
a
combination
of
circumstances
.
First
,
the
general
stock_market
has
been
boiling
upward
for
the
last
few
months
,
driving drive%2:38:02::
stocks
of
all
kinds
up
.
As
a
result
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
not
easy
to
find find%2:39:02::
a
stock
priced price%2:40:00::
as
the
Morton
issue
was
priced price%2:40:00::
(
at
roughly
10
times
1960
earnings
,
to
yield yield%2:36:00::
a_little
over
5
per_cent
on
the
64
c
anticipated
dividend
)
.
Second
,
the
``
potato_chip
industry
''
has
caught catch%2:35:07::
the
fancy
of
investors
lately
,
and
until
Morton
Foods
came_along come_along%2:30:00::
there
were be%2:42:00::
only
two
potato_chip
stocks
-
Frito
and
H._W._Lay
-
on
the
market
.
Both
of
those
have
had have%2:30:01::
dynamic
run-ups
in
price
on
the
market
in
recent
months
,
both
were
selling sell%2:42:00::
at
higher
price-earnings
and
yield
bases
than
Morton
was
coming come%2:38:04::
to
market
at
,
and
everyone
who
knew know%2:31:03::
anything
about
it
expected expect%2:31:00::
the
Morton
stock
to
have have%2:30:01::
a
fast
run-up
.
And
third
,
the
potato_chip
industry
has
taken_on take_on%2:30:00::
the
flavor
of
a
``
growth
''
industry
in
the
public
mind
of_late
.
Foods
,
which
long
had
been
considered consider%2:31:00::
``
recession
resistant
''
but
hardly
dynamic
stocks
,
have
been
acting act%2:29:00::
like
growth_stocks
,
going_to go_to%2:38:00::
higher
price-earnings
ratios
.
The
potato_chip
industry
these
days
is
growing grow%2:30:00::
,
not_only
as
a
result
of
population
increase
and
public
acceptance
of
convenience_foods
,
but
also
because
of
a
combination
of
circumstances
that
has
led lead%2:42:04::
to
growth
by
merger
.
The
history
of
the
U._S.
potato_chip
industry
is be%2:42:03::
that
many_of
today
's
successful
companies
got_started get_started%2:30:00::
during
the
deep
depression
days
.
Those
that
remain remain%2:30:00::
are be%2:42:06::
those
that
were
headed head%2:41:00::
by
strong
executives
,
men
with
the
abilities
to
last last%2:42:01::
almost
30
years
in
the
competitive
survival_of_the_fittest
.
But
today
many_of
those
men
are
reaching reach%2:38:00::
retirement
age
and
suddenly
realizing realize%2:31:00::
that
they
face face%2:33:00::
an
estate_tax
problem
with
their
closely
held hold%2:40:02::
companies
and
also
that
they
have have%2:40:00::
no
second-echelon
management
in
their
firms
.
So
they
go
looking_for look_for%2:35:00::
mergers
with
other
firms
that
have
publicly
quoted quote%2:32:00::
stock
,
and
almost
daily
they
pound pound%2:35:00::
on
the
doors
of
firms
like
Frito
.
All
those
things
combined combine%2:35:01::
to
make make%2:30:00::
the
Morton
Foods_stock
the
hot_issue
that
it
was be%2:42:06::
and
is be%2:42:06::
.
Now
,
if

product
,
a

known
as
Chip-o
's
,
turns_out turn_out%2:42:01::
to
sell sell%2:42:00::
as_well
as
its
stock
did
,
the
stock
may
turn_out turn_out%2:42:01::
to
be be%2:42:03::
worth
every
cent
of
the
prices
that
the
avid
buyers
bid bid%2:40:00::
it
up_to
