Elisabeth_Schwarzkopf
sang sing%2:36:00::
so
magnificently
Saturday
night
at
Hunter_College
that
it
seems seem%2:39:00::
a
pity
to
have_to
register register%2:41:00::
any
complaints
.
Still
a
demurrer
or
two
must
be
entered enter%2:32:04::
.
Schwarzkopf
is be%2:42:06::
,
of_course
,
Schwarzkopf
.
For
style
and
assurance
,
for
a
supreme
and
regal
bearing
there
is be%2:42:00::
still
no
one
who
can
touch touch%2:42:02::
her
.
If
the
voice
is be%2:42:03::
just
a
shade
less
glorious
than
it
used_to
be be%2:42:03::
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
still
a
beautiful
instrument
,
controlled
and
flexible
.
Put put%2:35:05::
to
the
service
of
lieder
of
Schubert
,
Brahms
,
Strauss
and
Wolf
in
a
dramatical
and
musical
way
,
it
made make%2:30:00::
its
effect
with
ease
and
precision
.
But
what
has
been
happening happen%2:30:00::
recently
might
be
described describe%2:32:00::
as
creeping
mannerism
.
Instead
of
her
old
confidence
in
the
simplest
,
purest
,
most
moving
musical
expression
,
Miss_Schwarzkopf
is
letting let%2:41:00::
herself
be
tempted tempt%2:32:00::
by
the
classic
sin
of
artistic
pride
-
that
subtle
vanity
that
sometimes
misleads mislead%2:38:00::
a
great
artist
into
thinking think%2:31:03::
that
he
or
she
can
somehow
better better%2:30:01::
the
music
by
bringing bring%2:38:00::
to
it
something
extra
,
some
personal
dramatic
touch
imposed impose%2:41:00::
from_the_outside
.
The
symptoms
Saturday
night
were be%2:42:03::
unmistakable
.
Clever
light
songs
were be%2:42:03::
overly
coy
,
tragic
songs
a_little
too
melodramatic
.
There
was be%2:42:00::
an
extra
pause
here
,
a
gasp
or
a
sigh
there
,
here_and_there
an
extra
little
twist
of
a
word
or
note
,
all_in
the
interest
of
effect
.
The
result
was be%2:42:03::
like
that
of
a
beautiful
painting
with
some
of
the
highlights
touched_up touch_up%2:30:00::
almost
to_the_point
of
garishness
.
There
were be%2:42:00::
stunning
musical_phrases
too
,
and
sometimes
the
deepest
kind_of
musical
and
poetic
absorption
and
communication
.
Miss_Schwarzkopf
and
her
excellent
pianist
,
John_Wustman
,
often
achieved achieve%2:41:00::
the
highest
lyrical
ideals
of
the
lieder
tradition
.
All
the
more
reason
why
there
should
have
been be%2:42:00::
no
place
for
the
frills
;
Miss_Schwarzkopf
is be%2:42:03::
too
great
an
artist
to
need need%2:42:00::

.
The

when

of

On
Saturday
,
the

situated

Among

solo
ballet_dancers

the
evening

Elisabeth_Carroll

Ivan_Allen
were be%2:42:03::
particularly
impressive
in
their
roles
in
``
The
Duel

work
that

so_much
upon
the
precision

combatants

and

human

strong
contrast
to
the
ballet
selections
of

evening

As

the
guitar
and

accompaniments
of
Bruce_Langhorne

Shep_Shepard
,
Mr._Ailey
and
Miss_De_Lavallade
went_through go_through%2:34:01::
volatile
dances
that
were be%2:42:03::
by
turns
insinuating
,
threatening
,
contemptuous
and
ecstatic
.
Their
props
were be%2:42:02::
two
stepladders
,
a
chair
and
a
palm
fan
.
He
wore wear%2:29:00::
the
clothes
of
a
laborer
,
and
she
was be%2:42:03::
wondrously
seductive
in
a
yellow
and
orange
dress
.
The
cat-like
sinuousness
and
agility
of
both
dancers
were
exploited exploit%2:34:01::
in
leaps
,
lifts
,
crawls
and
slides
that
were be%2:42:03::
almost
invariably
compelling
in
a
work
of
strong
,
sometimes
almost
frightening
,
tensions
.
``
Roots

souls

welcome welcome%2:40:00::
its

pieces
that
are be%2:42:03::
neither
short_stories

something
midway

The
only
man
alive

seems seem%2:39:00::

The
result

rather
wonderful

but
so
rich
as
to
be be%2:42:03::
indigestible
if
taken take%2:34:00::

There
are be%2:42:00::
sixteen
essays

Most_of

originally

All
are be%2:42:03::

But
,

Mr._Sansom

Too

Mr._Sansom

This

He

hardly

It
is be%2:42:03::
an
over-all
impression
Mr._Sansom
strives strive%2:41:00::
for

an
impression
compounded compound%2:30:00::
of

of
a
savory

of
much
loving

of
lights

of

William_Sansom

only
about

frequently
of
such
familiar
places
as
London

Vienna

the
Norwegian

But
no_matter
what
he

``

Mr._Sansom
can
be be%2:42:03::
eloquent
in

spectacular
way
which
recalls recall%2:31:00::
(
to
those
who
recall recall%2:31:00::

the
statues

gigantic
paintings

He
can

neat
phrase
:
``
a
street
spattered

an
invigoration

;
tulips
with
``
petals
wide

shaggy
as

;
after

,
for

almost
Byzantine
self-consciousness

he
can
make make%2:32:00::
one

the
aptness

In

Mr._Sansom

In

have

extensive

the
passing
of

WBAI
,
the
listener-supported
outlet
on
the
frequency-modulation
band
,
has
decided decide%2:31:00::
to
do do%2:36:01::
what
it
can
to
correct correct%2:30:00::
this
aural
void
.
Yesterday
it
offered offer%2:40:02::
``
Poised poise%2:37:00::
for
Violence
''
,
by
Jean_Reavey
.
WBAI
is be%2:42:03::
on
the
right
track
:
in
the
sound
medium
there
has
been be%2:42:00::
excessive
emphasis
on
music
and
news
and
there
could
and
should
be be%2:42:00::
a
place
for
theatre
,
as
the
Canadian
and
British
Broadcasting
Corporations
continue continue%2:32:00::
to
demonstrate demonstrate%2:31:00::
.
Unfortunately
,
``
Poised
for
Violence
''
was be%2:42:03::
not
the
happiest
vehicle
with
which
to
make make%2:30:00::
the
point
.
Mrs._Reavey
's
work
is
written write%2:32:00::
for
the
stage
-
it
is
mentioned mention%2:32:02::
for
an
off-Broadway
production
in
the
fall
-
and
,
in_addition
,
employs employ%2:34:00::
an
avant-garde
structure
that
particularly
needs need%2:42:02::
to
be
seen see%2:39:03::
if
comprehension
is be%2:42:03::
to
be
encouraged encourage%2:41:00::
.
The
play
's
device
is be%2:42:03::
to
explore explore%2:31:02::
society
's
obsession
with
disaster
and
violence
through
the
eyes
of
a
group
of
artist
's
models
who
remain remain%2:30:00::
part
of
someone
else
's
painting
rather_than
just
be be%2:42:03::
themselves
.
In
a
succession
of
scenes
they
appear appear%2:30:00::
in
different
guises
-
patrons
of
a
cafe
,
performers
in
a
circus
and
participants
in
a
family
picnic
-
but
in
each
instance
they
inevitably
put put%2:35:00::
ugliness
before
beauty
.
Somewhere
in
Mrs._Reavey
's
play
there
is be%2:42:00::
both
protest
and
aspiration
of
merit
.
But
its
relentless
discursiveness
and
determined
complexity
are be%2:42:03::
so
overwhelming
that
after
an
hour
and
a
half
a
listener
's
stamina
begins begin%2:30:00::
to
wilt wilt%2:30:01::
.
Moreover
,
her
central
figures
are
so
busily
fulfilling fulfill%2:36:00::
their
multitudinous
assignments
that
none
emerges emerge%2:30:02::
as
an
arresting
individual
in
his
own
right
or
as
a
provocative
symbol
of
mankind
's
ills
.
But
quite
conceivably
an
altogether
different
impression
will
obtain obtain%2:42:00::
when
the
work
is
offered offer%2:40:02::
in
the
theatre

there
can
be be%2:42:00::
other
effects
to
relieve relieve%2:29:00::
the
burden
on
the
author
's
words
.
Which
in
itself
is be%2:42:03::
an
immediate
reward
of
the
WBAI
experiment

good
radio
drama
has have%2:40:00::
