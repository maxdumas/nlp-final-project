The_most
surprising
thing
about
the
Twenty-second_Congress
of
the
Soviet
Communist_Party
is be%2:42:06::
that
it
was be%2:42:03::
surprising
-
perhaps
quite
as
much
,
in
its
own
way
,
as
the
Twentieth_Congress
of
1956
,
which
ended end%2:42:00::
with_that
famous
``
secret
''
report
on
Stalin
.
The
publication
last
July
of
the
party
's
Draft
Program
-
that
blueprint
for
the
``
transition
to
communism
''
-
had
led lead%2:32:00::
the
uninitiated
to
suppose suppose%2:31:00::
that
this
Twenty-second_Congress
would
be be%2:42:03::
a
sort_of
apotheosis
of
the
Khrushchev
regime
,
a
solemn
consecration
of
ideas
which
had
,
in_fact
,
been be%2:42:03::
current
over
the
last
three
or
four
years
(
i.
e.
,
since
the
defeat
of
the
``
anti-party
group
''
)
in_all
theoretical
party
journals
.
These
never
ceased cease%2:42:00::
to
suggest suggest%2:32:04::
that
if
,
in
the
eyes
of
Marx
and
Lenin
``
full
communism
''
was be%2:42:03::
still
a
very
distant
ideal
,
the
establishment
of
a
Communist
society
had
now
,
under
Khrushchev
,
become become%2:42:01::
an
``
immediate
and
tangible
reality
''
.
It
seems seem%2:39:01::
that
Khrushchev
himself
took take_pride%2:37:00::
a
very
special
pride
in
having
made make%2:41:00::
a
world-shaking
contribution
to
Marxist
doctrine
with
his
Draft
Program
(
a
large
part
of
his
twelve-hour
speech
at
the
recent
Congress
was be%2:42:03::
,
in_fact
,
very
largely
a
rehash
of_that
interminable
document
)
.
He
and
other
Soviet
leaders
responsible_for
the
document
were be%2:42:03::
proud
of
having
brought_forward bring_forward%2:32:00::
some
new
formulas
,
such_as
the
early
replacement
of
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
by
an
``
All
People
's
State
''
,
and
also
of
having
laid_down lay_down%2:31:00::
the
lines
for
a
much
greater
``
democratization
''
of
the
whole
hierarchy
of
Soviets
,
starting start%2:42:00::
with
the
Supreme
Soviet
itself
.
Their
plan
for
rotation
of
leaders
promised promise%2:32:02::
a
salutary
blow
at
``
bureaucracy
''
and
would
enable enable%2:30:00::
``
the
people
''
to
take take%2:41:00::
a
more
direct
and
active
part
in
running run%2:41:02::
the
country
.
Also
,
elections
would
be be%2:42:03::
more
democratic
;
there
might
even
be
two
or
more
candidates
for
voters
to
choose choose%2:31:00::
from
.
No_doubt
,
there
was
still
a_lot
in
the
Draft
Program
-
and
in
Khrushchev
's
speech
-
which
left leave%2:30:02::
many
points
obscure
.
Was be%2:42:06::
it
the
party
's
intention
,
for_example
,
to
abolish abolish%2:41:00::
gradually
the
kolkhoz
system
and
replace replace%2:41:00::
it
by
uniformly
wage-earning
sovkhozes
,
i.
e.
,
state
farms
(
which
were be%2:42:03::
,
moreover
,
to
be
progressively
``
urbanized urbanize%2:30:00::
''
)
?
As
we
know know%2:31:01::
,
the
Soviet
peasant
today
still
very
largely
thrives thrive%2:40:00::
on
being be%2:42:03::
able
to
sell sell%2:40:00::
the
produce
grown grow%2:36:00::
on
his
private
plot
;
and
it
is be%2:42:03::
still
very
far
from
certain
how
valid
the
party
's
claim
is be%2:42:03::
that
in
``
a
growing
number
of
kolkhozes
''
the
peasants
are
finding find%2:31:09::
it
more
profitable
,
to
surrender surrender%2:40:00::
their
private
plots
to
the
kolkhoz
and
to
let let%2:41:00::
the
latter
be
turned_into turn_into%2:42:00::
something
increasingly
like
a
state
farm
.
If
one
follows follow%2:31:00::
the
reports
of
the
Congress
,
one
finds find%2:39:02::
that
there
still
seems seem%2:39:00::
considerable
uncertainty
in
the
minds
of
the
leaders
themselves
about
what
exactly
to
do do%2:41:01::
in
this
matter
.
The
Draft
Program
was be%2:42:03::
interesting
in_other_respects
,
too
.
It
contained contain%2:42:00::
,
for_example
,
a_number_of
curious
admissions
about
the
peasants
,
who
enjoy enjoy%2:34:01::
no
sickness_benefits
,
no
old-age
pensions
,
no
paid
holidays
;
they
still
benefit benefit%2:40:00::
far
less_than
the
``
other
''
50
per_cent
of
the
nation
from_that
``
welfare_state
''
which
the
Soviet_Union
so
greatly
prides pride%2:37:00::
itself
on
being be%2:42:03::
.
Over
all
these
fairly
awkward
problems
Khrushchev
was
to
skate skate_over%2:41:00::
rather
lightly
;
and
,
though
he
repeated repeat%2:32:00::
,
over_and_over_again
,
the
spectacular
figures
of
industrial
and
agricultural
production
in
1980
,
the
``
ordinary
''
people
in
Russia
are be%2:42:03::
still
a_little
uncertain
as
to
how
``
communism
''
is
really
going
to
work work%2:41:03::
in_practice
,
especially
in
respect
of
food
.
Would
agriculture
progress progress%2:30:00::
as
rapidly
as
industry
?
This
was be%2:42:03::
something
on_which
K.
himself
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
have have%2:39:06::
some
doubts
;
for
he
kept_on keep_on%2:42:00::
threatening threaten%2:32:00::
that
he
would
``
pull pull%2:35:00::
the
ears
''
of
those
responsible_for
agricultural
production
.
And
,
as
we
know know%2:31:01::
,
the_Virgin
Lands
are
not
producing produce%2:36:05::
as
much_as
Khrushchev
had
hoped hope%2:31:00::
.
One
cannot
but
wonder wonder%2:32:01::
whether
these
doubts
about
the
success
of
Khrushchev
's
agricultural
policy
have have%2:42:12::
not
at_least
something
to
do do%2:42:00::
with
one
of
the
big
surprises
provided provide%2:41:00::
by
this
Congress
-
the
obsessive
harping harp%2:32:00::
on
the
crimes
and
misdeeds
of
the
``
anti-party
group
''
-
Molotov
,
Malenkov
,
Kaganovich
and_others
-
including include%2:31:00::
the
eighty-year-old
Marshal_Voroshilov
.
Molotov
,
in_particular
,
is
being
charged charge%2:32:03::
with
all
kinds
of
sins
-
especially
with
wanting want%2:37:00::
to
cut_down cut_down%2:30:00::
free
public_services
,
to
increase increase%2:30:02::
rents
and
fares
;
in_fact
,
with
having
been be%2:42:03::
against
all
the
more
popular
features
of
the
Khrushchev
``
welfare_state
''
.
The
trouble
with
all
these
doctrinal
quarrels
is be%2:42:06::
that
we
hear hear%2:31:00::
only
one
side
of
the
story
:
what
,
in
the
secret
councils
of
the
Kremlin
,
Molotov
had
really
proposed propose%2:31:00::
,
we
just
do
n't
know know%2:31:01::
,
and
he
has
had have%2:40:00::
no
chance
to
reply reply%2:32:00::
.
But
one
cannot
escape escape%2:32:00::
the
suspicion
that
all
this
non-stop
harping_on
the
misdeeds
of
the
long
liquidated
``
anti-party
''
group
would
be be%2:42:03::
totally
unnecessary
if
there
were be%2:42:04::
not
,
inside
the
party
,
some
secret
but
genuine
opposition
to
Khrushchev
on
vital
doctrinal
grounds
,
on
the
actual
methods
to
be
employed employ%2:34:00::
in
the
``
transition
to
communism
''
and
,
last_but_not_least
,
on
foreign_policy
.
The
whole
problem
of
``
peaceful
coexistence
and
peaceful
competition
''
with
the
capitalist
world
is be%2:42:04::
in
the
very
center
of_this
Congress
.
Mikoyan
declared declare%2:32:01::
:
``
Molotov
altogether
rejects reject%2:32:00::
the
line
of
peaceful
coexistence
,
reducing reduce%2:30:06::
this
concept
merely
to
the
state
of
peace
or
rather
,
the
absence
of
war
at
a
given
moment
,
and
to
a
denial
of
the
possibility
of
averting avert%2:41:00::
a
world_war
.
His
views
,
in_fact
,
coincide coincide%2:42:01::
with
those
of
foreign
enemies
of
peaceful
coexistence
,
who
look_upon look_upon%2:31:00::
it
merely
as
a
variant
of
the
''
cold_war
``
or
of
an
''
armed
peace
``
''
.
One
cannot
help help%2:42:08::
wondering wonder%2:32:01::
whether
Molotov
and
the
rest
of
the
``
anti-party
group
''
are
not
being
used use%2:34:01::
as
China
's
whipping-boys
by
Khrushchev
and
his
faithful
followers
.
For
something
,
clearly
,
has
gone go_wrong%2:41:00::
very
,
very
seriously
wrong
in
Soviet-Chinese
relations
,
which
were be%2:42:03::
never
easy
,
and
have
now
deteriorated deteriorate%2:30:00::
.
The
effect
of
Chou_En-lai
's
clash
with
Khrushchev
,
together
with
the
everlasting
attacks
on
Molotov
+
Co.
,
has
shifted shift%2:30:00::
the
whole
attention
of
the
world
,
including include%2:31:00::
that
of
the
Soviet
people
,
from
the
``
epoch-making
''
twenty-year
program
to
the
present
Soviet-Chinese
conflict
.
Not_only
,
as
we
know know%2:31:01::
,
did
Chou_En-lai
publicly
treat treat%2:32:00::
Khrushchev
's
attack
on
Albania
as
``
something
that
we
cannot
consider consider%2:31:00::
as
a
serious
Marxist-Leninist
approach
''
to
the
problem
(
i.
e.
,
as
something
thoroughly
dictatorial
and
``
undemocratic
''
)
,
but
the
Albanian
leaders
went go%2:41:00::
out
of
their
way
to
be be%2:42:03::
openly
abusive
to
Khrushchev
,
calling call%2:32:00::
him
a
liar
,
a
bully
,
and_so_on
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
extremely
doubtful
that
the
handful
of
Albanians
who
call call%2:32:02::
themselves
Communists
could
have
done do%2:41:01::
this
without
the
direct
approval
of
their
Chinese
friends
.
The
big
question
is be%2:42:06::
whether
,
in
the
name
of
a
restored
Chinese-Soviet
solidarity
,
the
Chinese
will
choose choose%2:31:01::
to
persuade persuade%2:32:00::
the
Albanians
to
present present%2:40:01::
their
humble
apologies
to
Khrushchev
-
or
get_rid_of get_rid_of%2:30:00::
Enver_Hoxa
.
These
seem seem%2:39:00::
about
the
only
two
ways
in_which
the
``
unhappy
incident
''
can
now
be
closed close%2:41:01::
.
But
Albania
is be%2:42:02::
merely
a
symptom
of
a
real
malaise
between
China
and
Russia
.
There
are
other
symptoms
.
Khrushchev
,
for
all
his
bombastic
prophecies
about
the
inevitable
decay
of
capitalism
,
is be%2:42:03::
genuinely
favorable
to
``
peaceful
coexistence
''
and
would
like like%2:37:01::
,
above_all
,
the
Berlin
and
German
problems
to
be
settled settle%2:31:00::
peacefully
;
he
knows know%2:31:01::
that
he
was be%2:42:03::
never
more
popular
than
at_the_time
of
the
Russo-American
``
honeymoon
''
of
1959
.
But
it
seems seem%2:39:01::
that
pressures
against
him
are
coming come%2:38:00::
from
somewhere
-
in_the_first_place
from
China
,
but
perhaps
also
from_that
``
China_Lobby
''
which
,
I
was
assured assure%2:32:00::
in
Moscow
nearly
two
years
ago
,
exists exist%2:42:00::
on_the_quiet
inside
the
party
.
To
these
people
,
solidarity
and
unity
with
China
should
be be%2:42:02::
the
real
basis
of
Russia
's
future
policy
.
And
the
Chinese
,
as
the
Albanian
incident
shows show%2:39:04::
,
have have%2:39:06::
strong
suspicions
that
Khrushchev
is be%2:42:03::
anxious
to
secure secure%2:40:00::
a
``
shameful
''
peace
with
the
West
.
The
fact
that
China
(
which
is be%2:42:03::
obsessed
by
Formosa
-
to
Khrushchev
a
very
small
matter
)
should
be
supported support%2:41:00::
by
North_Korea
and
North_Vietnam
is be%2:42:03::
highly
indicative
.
And
one
cannot
but
wonder wonder%2:32:01::
whether
Marshal_Malinovsky
,
who
was
blowing
hot
and
cold
,
exalting exalt%2:32:00::
peace
but
also
almost
openly
considering consider%2:32:02::
the
possibility
of
preventive
war
against
the
West
,
was
n't
trying try%2:41:00::
to
keep keep%2:42:00::
the
Chinese
quiet
.
And
this
brings bring%2:38:00::
us
inevitably
to
the
30
-
or
50
-
megaton_bomb
.
Was
not
this
dropped drop%2:38:01::
primarily
in_order_to
``
appease appease%2:37:00::
''
the
Chinese
-
especially
after
``
Khrushchev
's
''
humiliating
``
surrender
to
the
West
in
canceling cancel%2:41:03::
the
German
peace-treaty
deadline
of
December
31
?
What
does
it
all
add_up add_up%2:42:01::
to
?
Indications
are be%2:42:06::
that
Khrushchev
(
and
,
with
him
,
the
bulk
of
the
Soviet
people
)
favor favor%2:41:00::
peaceful
coexistence
and
(
with
the
exception
of
Berlin
)
the
maintenance
of
the
status_quo
in
the
world
.
The
Chinese
,
North
Vietnamese
and
North
Koreans
,
on_the_other_hand
,
feel feel%2:31:00::
that
,
militarily
,
Russia
is be%2:42:03::
strong
enough
to
support support%2:41:00::
them
in
the
``
just
wars
of
liberation
''
they
would
like like%2:37:01::
to
embark_on embark_on%2:36:00::

Formosa
and
the
North
Koreans
and
North
Vietnamese
liberating liberate%2:41:01::
the
southern
half
of
their
respective
countries
.
Perhaps
Khrushchev
is be%2:42:03::
in
a
more
difficult
position
than
any
since
1957
,
when
the
``
anti-party
group
''
nearly
liquidated liquidate%2:35:00::
him
.
He
seems seem%2:39:00::
strong
enough
inside
the
party
to
cope_with cope_with%2:41:00::
any
internal
opposition
;
but
if
he
is be%2:42:03::
up
against
China
's
crusading
spirit
in
world
affairs
,
he
is
going_to
be
faced face%2:32:00::
with
the_most
agonizing
choice
in
his
life
.
He
may
support support%2:41:00::
China
(

he
won

)
;
he
may
break_with break_with%2:41:00::

would
be be%2:42:03::

,
by
all
kinds
of
dangerous
concessions
,
in
persuading persuade%2:32:00::

patient
.
The
next
days
may
show show%2:39:03::
where
things
stand stand%2:31:01::
.
On
a
misty
Sunday
morning
last
month
,
a
small
band
of
militant
anti-Communists
called
the
Minutemen
held hold%2:36:00::
maneuvers
in
a
foggy
field
about
fifteen
miles
east
of
here
.
Eleven
men
,
a
woman
and
a
teen-age
boy
tramped tramp%2:38:00::
over
cold
,
damp
,
fog-enshrouded
ground
during
a
two-hour
field
drill
in
the
problems
of
guerrilla
warfare
.
To
the
average
American
,
this
must
sound sound%2:39:06::
like
an
incredible
tale
from
a
Saturday
night
TV
movie
.
But
to
the
Minutemen
,
this
is be%2:42:03::
a
serious
business
.
They
feel feel%2:31:00::
that
the
United_States
is
engaged engage%2:41:06::
in
a
life-and-death
struggle
with
communism
for
survival
and
world
supremacy
.
They
feel feel%2:31:00::
that
World_War
3
,
has
already
begun begin%2:30:00::
,
and
they
are
setting set_up%2:41:00::
themselves
up
as
a
``
last
line_of_defense
''
against
the
Communist
advance
.
Their
national_leader

,
says say%2:32:01::
the
Minutemen
believe believe%2:31:04::
that
guerrilla
tactics
are be%2:42:03::
best
suited
to
defeat defeat%2:33:00::
the

onslaught

In
