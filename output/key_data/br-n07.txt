``

``

Before
they
could
guess guess%2:31:01::
his
intention
Rankin
stepped step%2:38:00::
forward
and
swung swing%2:38:02::
the
guard
's
own
gun
against
the
uncovered
head
,
hard
.
The
man
went_over go_over%2:29:00::
without
sound
,
falling fall%2:38:03::
to
the
bare
floor

Barton
said say%2:32:00::
harshly
,
``
Why
did

?
Rankin
sneered sneer%2:29:00::

Barton
caught catch%2:35:00::

around

Fred_Rankin
looked look%2:39:00::
at
him
.
It
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
Barton
that
the
green
eyes
mocked mock%2:32:00::
him
,
the
thin-lipped
smile
held hold%2:37:00::
insolence

he
had have%2:40:01::
no

``
Come_on

They
filed_out file_out%2:38:00::
through
the
guard-room
door
,
into
the
paved
square
.
There
were
three
other
men
within
this
prison
whom
Barton
would
have
liked like%2:37:01::
to
liberate liberate%2:41:02::
,
but
they
were be%2:42:05::
in
other
cell

There
was
no

They
moved move%2:38:03::
slowly
,
toward
the
main
gate

following follow%2:38:01::
the
wall

There
was
no
moon

They
had
chosen choose%2:31:00::

They
reached reach%2:38:01::
the
guard
house
without
alerting alert%2:32:00::
the
men
on
the
walls
above
,
and
Powers
slipped slip%2:38:01::
through

door

Two
men
were be%2:42:03::
on_duty
inside
,
playing play%2:33:00::
pinochle

relaxed

They
looked look%2:39:00::
up
in

Powers
came_in come_in%2:38:02::

``
What

.
``
I

They
stared stare%2:39:00::

The

climbed climb%2:38:00::

?
``

The
sergeant
turned turn%2:38:00::
to
the
door
.
As
he
passed_through pass_through%2:38:00::
it
Barton
shoved shove%2:38:00::
his
gun
against
the
man
's
side
.
``
One
sound
and
you
're be%2:42:03::

The

froze freeze%2:38:00::
.
Powers
had
not
followed follow%2:38:00::
.
Powers
was
covering cover%2:33:01::
the
remaining
guard

The
man
half
reached reach%2:35:00::
for
the
cord
of
the
alarm_bell
.
Powers
knocked knock%2:35:04::
his
arm
aside
.
Deliberately
,
with
none
of
Rankin
's
viciousness
,
he
laid lay%2:35:01::
the
barrel
of
his
gun
alongside
the
guard

head
.
They
were be%2:42:03::
free

Even
Barton
could
not_quite
believe believe%2:31:00::
it

It
had
gone go%2:41:00::
without

They
slid slide%2:38:01::
through
the
wicket
in
the
big
gate
,
ghosted ghost%2:38:00::
across
the
dark
ground
.
Five
minutes
later
they
reached reach%2:38:01::
the
horses
.
Barton
was be%2:42:03::
relieved
to
see see%2:39:02::
that
Carl_Dill
and
Emmett_Foster
had
brought bring%2:35:00::
extra
mounts
.
He
had
been be%2:42:03::
worried
that
with
Miller

Rankin
added add%2:30:00::
to
the
escape
party
they
would
be be%2:42:03::
short
.
No
one
hurried hurry%2:30:00::
.
They
walked walk%2:38:01::
the
horses
,
heading head%2:38:00::
along
the
river
,
Barton
and
Emmett_Foster
in_the_lead
,
seven
men
riding ride%2:38:01::
quietly
through
the
night
.
The
only
thing
which
would
have
attracted attract%2:35:00::
attention
was be%2:42:06::
that
two
wore wear%2:29:00::
the
uniform
of
prison_guards
,
three
the
striped
suits
of
convicts
.
Five
miles
.
In
a
small
grove
against
the
river
they
halted halt%2:38:01::
,
turning turn%2:38:00::
deep
into
the
protection
of
the
trees
.
Foster
had
brought bring%2:35:00::
extra
clothing
also
.
A
good
man
,
Emmett
.
He
had
been be%2:42:06::
one
of
the
original
Night_Riders
,
one
who
had
escaped escape%2:32:00::
the
trial
.
It
was
to
him
that
Barton
had
sent send%2:38:01::
Carl_Dill
on
Dill
's
release
from
the
prison
.
Clyde_Miller
was
crying cry%2:29:00::
softly
to
himself
,
shedding shed%2:35:01::
his
striped
suit
and
fumbling fumble%2:35:00::
into
the
nondescript
butternut
pants
,
the
worn
brown
shirt
.
Kid_Boyd
was be%2:42:03::
unusually
silent
,
Rankin
watchful
,
a_few
paces
apart

Barton
finished finish%2:30:01::
his
dressing
and
extended extend%2:29:01::
his
hand
to
Powers
.
``
I

.
The
ex-prison
guard
was be%2:42:03::
embarrassed

He
said say%2:32:00::
in
a
studied
voice
,
``
I

Barton
turned_away turn_away%2:38:02::
,
his
eyes
falling fall%2:42:04::
upon
Rankin
beside
his
horse

``
Good_luck

The

lifted lift%2:38:00::
his

.
``
I
got
no

.
Barton
hesitated hesitate%2:42:01::
.
He
did
not
trust trust%2:31:00::
Rankin
,
his
violent
temper
,
his
killer
instinct
.
But
ten
years
in
prison
had
taught teach%2:32:00::
him
realities
.
They
were be%2:42:03::
in
a
fight
,
outweighed outweigh%2:33:00::
in
both
numbers
and
money
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
all_right
to
put put%2:35:05::
a
bunch
of
ranchers
onto
horses
,
to
call call%2:32:02::
them

,
to
set_out set_out%2:30:00::
to
attack attack%2:33:00::
the
largest
mining

the
country
had
ever
seen see%2:39:02::
if
all
they
wanted want%2:37:00::
was be%2:42:06::
adventure
.
But
if
they
really
hoped hope%2:31:00::
to
succeed succeed%2:41:00::
they
needed need%2:42:00::
professionals
,
men

knew know%2:31:03::

who
would
match match%2:42:01::

``
Your

,
he
said say%2:32:00::
briefly
,
and
turned_to turn_to%2:32:01::
Kid_Boyd
.
``
Bury bury%2:35:00::

.
Then
Barton
touched touch%2:35:00::
Carl_Dill
's
arm
and
moved move%2:38:03::
off
,
up
the
river
bank
.
He
wanted want%2:37:00::
a
careful
,
uninterrupted
report
from
Dill
on
the
conditions
in
the
valley
.
They
squatted squat%2:35:00::
on
their
heels
in
the
deep
mud
and
Dill
found find%2:40:00::
a
cigar
in
his
breast_pocket
,
passing pass%2:40:00::
it
over
silently
.
He
too
knew know%2:31:03::
the
agony
of
going go%2:42:14::
for
weeks
,
sometimes
months
without
the
solace
of
tobacco
.
Mitchell_Barton
drew_in draw_in%2:35:02::
the
fragrance
deeply
,
letting let%2:41:00::
the
smoke
lie lie%2:42:00::
warm
and
soothing
in
his
throat
for
a
moment
before
he
exhaled exhale%2:29:00::
.
Through
the
gloom
he
could
not
see see%2:39:00::
the
man
beside
him
clearly
but
he
knew know%2:31:01::
him
thoroughly
.
For
his
first
five
years
in
prison
,
they
had
shared share%2:40:02::
a
cell
.
Carl_Dill
was be%2:41:00::
neither
a
rancher
nor
a
valley
man
.
He
had
been be%2:41:00::
the
auditor
for
the
mining
syndicate
,
and
he
had
stolen steal%2:40:00::
fifty
thousand
dollars
of
the
syndicate
's
money
.
He
had
done do%2:42:02::
time
for
the
theft
.
The
one
thing
they
had have%2:40:00::
in_common
was be%2:42:06::
their
hatred
.
Both
hated hate%2:37:00::
Donald_Kruger
.
It
had
drawn draw_together%2:35:00::
them
together
,
and
since
his
release
from
prison
Dill
had
worked work%2:41:02::
tirelessly
to
effect effect%2:36:00::
this_night
's
escape
.
He
said say%2:32:00::
now
,
``
I
've have_got%2:40:00::

the
perfect

.
Mitch_Barton
knew know%2:31:00::
the
place
.
Twenty
years
before
a
group
of
Easterners
had
bought_out buy_out%2:40:00::
the
Haskell
claims
in
the
rocky
hills
south
of

They
had
spent spend%2:40:00::

carving carve%2:35:01::
in
a
road
,
putting_up put_up%2:36:00::
buildings
,
drilling drill%2:35:00::
their

Then
the
vein
had
petered_out peter_out%2:42:00::
and
the
whole
project
had
been
abandoned abandon%2:40:01::
.
``
The
road

washed
badly

,
said say%2:32:00::
Dill
,
``
but
there

Barton
nodded nod%2:32:01::

``

``
As

Barton
waited wait%2:42:01::
for
a
long

,
then
asked ask%2:32:00::
the
question
which
lay lie%2:42:00::
always
uppermost
in
his
mind

``
My

Did

Dill
was be%2:42:03::
silent
as
if
he
hated hate%2:37:00::
to
answer answer%2:32:00::

and
Barton
had have%2:29:02::
a
cold

sick
feeling
of
apprehension

``
He

Barton
half
straightened straighten%2:38:01::
in
surprise

``
What

Again
Dill
hesitated hesitate%2:42:01::

Barton
cursed curse%2:32:00::
under
his
breath

After
another
long
pause
he
asked ask%2:32:00::

``
How

The
building
was
dwarfed dwarf%2:42:00::
by
the
scene
outside

There
a
dozen
giant
monitors
played play%2:38:00::
their
seventy-five-foot
jets
of
water
against
the
huge
seam
of
tertiary
gravel
which
was be%2:42:06::
the
mountainside
.
The
gravel
was be%2:42:06::
the
bed
of
an
ancient
river
,
buckled
in
some
prehistoric
upheaval
of
earth
.
It
was
partially
cemented cement%2:35:01::
by
ages
and
pressure

yet
it
crumpled crumple%2:38:00::
before
the
onslaught

the
powerful

the
force

and
with

A_million

A_million

The
monitors
ran run%2:35:00::
twenty-four_hours
each_day
.
Their
roar
,
like
the
swelling
volume
of
a_hundred
tornadoes
could
be
heard hear%2:39:00::
for
miles
.
Hague
,
like
all
who
worked work%2:41:00::
near
the_pits
,
was be%2:42:03::
partly
deafened
from
the
constant
assault
against
his
eardrums
.
He
was be%2:42:06::
a
big
man
,
wearing wear%2:29:00::
a
neat
flannel
shirt
against
the
cold
foothill
air
.
Fat
showed show%2:39:01::
in
loose
rolls
beneath
the
shirt
.
Ten
years
older
than
Mitch_Barton
,
he
had
clawed claw%2:38:00::
his
way
up
from
mucker
in
the_pits
to
manager
of
the
operation
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
proud_of
his
accomplishments
,
proud_of
his
job
,
proud
that
Donald_Kruger
and
his
associates
trusted trust%2:31:00::
him
.
He
lived live%2:42:06::
and
breathed breathe%2:42:00::
for
the
mining_company

No
man
could
have
reached reach%2:41:00::
his
spot
nor
held hold%2:40:04::
it
without
being be%2:42:03::
ruthless
,
and
Hague
had
made make%2:30:00::
a
virtue
of
ruthlessness
all_of
his
life
.
There
came come%2:30:01::
a
ghost
of
noise
at
the
office
door
and
Hague
swung swing_around%2:38:00::
to
see see%2:39:00::
Kodyke
in
the
entrance
from
the
outer
room
.
Hague
had
never
accustomed accustom%2:30:00::
himself
to
Kodyke
.
The
man
was be%2:42:03::
tall
,
thin
,
with
a
narrow
face
and
a
too-large
nose
.
The
eyes
always
held hold%2:42:00::
Hague
,
eyes
of
a
dead
man
,
lidless
as
a
lizard
's
,
with
the
fixed
intensity
of
a
cobra
.
Even
Hague
was
repelled repel%2:37:00::
by
the
machinelike
deadliness
that
was be%2:42:02::
Kodyke

He
knew know%2:31:01::
nothing

Kodyke
had
appeared appear%2:30:00::
at
the
mine
one_day
bearing bear%2:35:00::
a
letter
from
Kruger
.
Kodyke
was
to
head head%2:41:00::
the
dread
company
police
.
He
ran run%2:41:02::
the
change
rooms

He
threw_out throw_out%2:40:00::
the
hi-graders

He
supervised supervise%2:41:00::
the
cleanups

handled handle%2:41:00::
the
shipments
of
raw
gold
which
each_week
went_out go_out%2:38:00::
to
San_Francisco

Hague
squeezed squeeze%2:35:05::
down
his
uneasy
dislike
.
He
pulled pull%2:35:00::
open
the
top
drawer
of
his
desk

drew draw%2:38:01::
out

Kodyke
took take%2:35:00::
the

The

slipping slip%2:30:04::
the

into

saying say%2:32:00::

Normally
