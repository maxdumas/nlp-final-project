the
processes

in
the
functioning
of
the
element
of
sentiment
or
feeling
.
One
of
the
devices
for
tension
management
is be%2:42:06::
preferential
mating
.
The
preferential
mating
of_this
particular
population
has
been
analyzed analyze%2:31:00::
in
a
separate
study
.
The
relative
geographical
isolation
of
the
Brandywine
population
makes_for make_for%2:36:00::
a
limited
choice
in
mating
.
It
would
seem seem%2:39:00::
necessary
that
members

provide provide%2:40:00::
support
for
one
another
since
it
is
not

by
the
larger
society
.
The
supportive
relations
can
apparently
be
achieved achieve%2:41:00::
in
geographical
and
social
isolation
.
The
newlyweds
building build%2:36:00::
homes
on
the

land
with
either
set
of
parents
,
and
the
almost
exclusive
use
of
members
of
the
population
as
sponsors
for
baptisms
and
weddings
illustrate illustrate%2:32:00::
this
supportive
relationship
.
As
Loomis
remarks remark%2:32:00::
,
``
In
the

the

.
Maintenance
of
the
status_quo
might
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
the
appropriate
goal

of_this

Yet
,
the
object
of
the
element

through
the

this
population
appears appear%2:39:00::

by
circumstances
brought_about

the
war

Prior
to
World_War
2
,
there
was
a
higher
percentage
of
endogamous
marriages
than
after
World_war

,
.
The
norms
,
as
elements
,
refer refer%2:42:00::
to
``

.
The
process
of
evaluation
assigns assign%2:40:01::
varying
positive
and
negative
priorities
or
values
to
elements
.
The
elements
and
processes
become become%2:30:00::
evident
in
a
study
of
mate
selection
in_this
population
.
From
the
evidence
``
it
may
be
conjectured conjecture%2:31:00::
that

.
The
element
of
status-roles
and
associated
processes
have
not
been
sufficiently
investigated investigate%2:32:00::
for
this
population
to
permit permit%2:32:00::
any
type
of
conjectures
about
them
.
There
is
some
indication
from
a
limited
number
of
interviews
with
members
of
the
population
that
the
element
of
power
,
primarily
the
voluntary
influence

non-authoritative
power

has
been
exerted exert%2:34:00::
on

somewhat

Again
,
size
of
the
group
may
have have%2:40:00::
some
influence
on
the
strength
of
group
controls
.
Interviews

the
Brandywine

attempted attempt%2:36:00::

the
ranking

The
large

the

Loomis
considers consider%2:31:00::
ranking

``

the

,
that

The
present
study
relates relate%2:42:00::
to
the
theory

It
is
hypothesized hypothesize%2:31:00::
that

is be%2:42:06::
a
function
of
the
social_system
when
the
population
as_a_whole

the
two-fold
division

.
The
four
functional
problems
of
a
social_system
are
,
to_some_extent
,
solved solve%2:31:00::
by
the
subsystems
within
this
population
.
By
means
of
geographical
isolation
and
high
fertility_rates
,
inbreeding
can
be
fostered foster%2:41:00::
and
the
pattern
of
isolation
from
the
greater
society
maintained maintain%2:40:00::
.
In_order_to
attain attain%2:41:00::
the
goal
of
group
solidarity
and
to
relieve relieve%2:29:00::
tension
,
the
high
fertility_rate
provides provide%2:40:00::
more
group
members
for
mate
selection
,
and
the
clustering
of
members
in
groups
fosters foster%2:41:00::
acceptance
of
group
controls
.
To
maintain maintain%2:40:00::
their
intermediate
position
in
the
larger
society
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
not_only
necessary
that
members

be be%2:42:03::
``
visible
''
,
but
that
their
numbers
be be%2:42:03::
great
enough
to
be
recognized recognize%2:31:02::
as
a
separate
,
distinct
grouping
or
system
in
society
.
As
mentioned mention%2:32:02::
above
,
where
families
are
concentrated concentrate%2:30:02::
in
larger
numbers
,
group
controls
seem seem%2:39:00::
strongest

most
effective
.
Adaptation
to
the
social
and
non-social
environment
through
the
economy
has
been
met meet%2:34:00::
to
a
degree
through
a
type
of
occupational
segregation
.
This
provides provide%2:40:00::
the
necessary
contact
with
the
larger
society
,
while
supporting support%2:35:00::
a
type
of
control
over
members
in_terms_of
social
contacts
.
Integration
``
has have%2:42:12::
to
do do%2:42:00::
with
the
inter-relation
of
parts
''
.
The
problem
of
solidarity
and
morale
again
involves involve%2:42:01::
the
concept
of
values
.
The
values
placed place%2:35:00::
by
the
Brandywine
population
,
upon
maintaining maintain%2:40:00::
a
certain
homogeneity
,
a
certain
separate
racial
identity
,
and
therefore
a
certain
separate
social_status
,
are be%2:42:03::
important
for
the
morale
of
the
system
.
Since
morale
is
closely
related relate%2:42:01::
to
pattern
maintenance
and
integration
,
the
higher
the
morale
and
solidarity
,
the
better
the
system
can
solve solve%2:31:00::
the
problems
of
the
system
.
In_this
respect
it
would
seem seem%2:39:01::
that
the
greater
the
social
distance
between
the
Brandywine
population
and
the
white
and
Negro
populations
within
the
same
general
locality
,
the
greater
the
possibility
for
higher
morale
and
solidarity
within
the
Brandywine
population
.
It
is
conceived conceive%2:36:00::
that
one
of
the
means
to
attain attain%2:41:00::
this
social
distance
is be%2:42:06::
that
of
physical
and
social
isolation
.
In_turn
,
higher
fertility_rates
for
this
population
provide provide%2:40:00::
a
means
of
increasing increase%2:30:00::
the
numerical_quantity
of
the
population
,
allowing_for allow_for%2:42:00::
the
possibility
of
greater
stability
and
unity
.
The
population
can
thereby
replenish replenish%2:30:00::
itself
and
actually
grow grow%2:30:00::
larger
.
Of
particular
utility
in
the
analysis
of
the
development
,
persistence
,
and
change
of
social_systems
has
been be%2:42:06::
the
use
of
the
master
or
comprehensive
processes
.
Loomis
considers consider%2:39:00::
six
such
processes
in
his
paradigm
.
1
.
Communication
2
.
Boundary
maintenance
3
.
Systemic
linkage
4
.
Socialization
5
.
Social_control
6
.
Institutionalization
Though
undoubtedly
all
six
processes
are be%2:42:03::
operative
within
the
whole
social_system
and
its
subsystems
,
two
processes
that
are be%2:42:03::
of
crucial
importance
to
this
study
will
be
singled_out single_out%2:31:00::
for
particular
emphasis
:
In
discussing discuss%2:32:01::
the
process
of
communication
,
Loomis
defines define%2:32:00::
it
as
``
the
process
by
which
information
,
decisions
,
and
directives
are
transmitted transmit%2:40:10::
among
actors
and
the
ways
in_which
knowledge
,
opinions
,
and
attitudes
are
formed form%2:42:02::
,
or
modified modify%2:30:00::
by
interaction
''
.
Communication
may
be
facilitated facilitate%2:30:00::
by
means
of
the
high
visibility
within
the
larger
community
.
Intense
interaction
is be%2:42:03::
easier
where
segregated
living
and
occupational
segregation
mark_off mark_off%2:30:00::
a
group
from
the
rest
of
the
community
,
as
in
the
case
of_this
population
.
However
,
the
factor
of
physical
isolation
is be%2:42:06::
not
a
static
situation
.
Although
the
Brandywine
population
is be%2:42:03::
still
predominantly
rural
,
``
there
are be%2:42:04::
indications
of
a
consistent
and
a
statistically
significant
trend
away
from
the
older
and
relatively
isolated
rural
communities
&
&
&
urbanization
appears appear%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
an
important
factor
in
the
disintegration
of_this
group
.
This
conclusion
is be%2:42:06::
,
however
,
an
over-simplification
.
A
more
realistic
analysis
must
take_into_account take_into_account%2:31:00::
the
fact
that
Brandywine
people
in
the
urban-fringe
area
are be%2:42:03::
,
in_general
,
less
segregated
locally
than
group
members
in
rural_areas
.
In
the
urban_area
,
in_other_words
,
they
,
unlike
some
urban
ethnic_groups
,
do
not
concentrate concentrate%2:38:00::
in
ghetto
colonies
.
Group
pressures
toward
conformity
are be%2:42:03::
slight
or
non-existent
,
and
deviant
behavior
in
mate
selection
incurs incur%2:42:00::
few
if
any
social
sanctions
.
In
such
a
setting
social
contacts
and
associations
are be%2:42:03::
likely
to
be be%2:42:03::
heterogamous
,
resulting result%2:42:02::
in
a
change
of
values
and
almost
necessarily
,
in
mate
selection
behavior
.
To
the
extent
that
urban
life
contributes contribute%2:41:12::
to
the
breakdown
of
the
group
patterns
of
residential
isolation
,
to_that_extent
it
contributes contribute%2:40:01::
directly
to
increased
exogamy
''
.
The
process
of
social_control
is be%2:42:03::
operative
insofar
as
sanctions
play play%2:41:12::
a
part
in
the
individual
's
behavior
,
as_well
as
the
group
's
behavior
.
By
means
of_this
social_control
,
deviance
is
either
eliminated eliminate%2:30:01::
or
somehow
made make%2:30:00::
compatible
with
the
function
of
the
social_group
.
Examples
from
this
population
indicate indicate%2:32:03::
that
deviance
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
be
sanctioned sanction%2:32:01::
by
ostracism
from
the
group
.
There
is
an
oral
tradition
among
the
members
of
the
population
in
regard_to
the
origin
and
subsequent
separate
status
of
the
group
in
the
larger
society
.
Confused
and
divided
though
this
tradition
may
be be%2:42:03::
,
it
is be%2:42:06::
an
important
part
of
the
social
and
cultural
heritage

the
group
,
and
acts_as act_as%2:42:00::
a

for
members

rural

The
fact
of
Indian
ancestry
and
``
free
''
status
during
the
days
of
slavery
,
are be%2:42:06::
important
distinctions
made make%2:31:00::
by
members
of
the
group

``

''
is be%2:42:03::
operative
in
the
boundary
maintenance
of
the
group
as_well
as
in
the
process
of
socialization

The
process

preserves preserve%2:40:00::

As

the
system
increases increase%2:30:00::
,
the
``
probability

mechanisms
increases increase%2:30:00::

.
The
fertility_rate

seem seem%2:39:00::
to

a

The
