Some

New_York
Philharmonic
musicians
who

in
the
suburbs
spent spend%2:42:00::
yesterday
morning
digging dig%2:35:00::
themselves
free
from
snow
.
A
tiny
handful
never
did
make make%2:38:02::
the
concert
.
But
,
after
a
fifteen-minute
delay
,
the
substantially
complete
Philharmonic
assembled assemble%2:36:00::
on
stage
for
the
afternoon
's
proceedings
.
They
faced face%2:32:00::
a
rather
small
audience
,
as
quite_a_few
subscribers
apparently
had
decided decide%2:31:00::
to
forego forego%2:42:00::
the
pleasures
of
the
afternoon
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
an
excellent
concert
.
Paul_Paray
,
rounding_out round_out%2:30:00::
his
current
stint
with
the
orchestra
,
is be%2:42:03::
a
solid
musician
,
and
the
Philharmonic
plays play%2:36:12::
for
him
.
Their
collaboration
in
the
Beethoven_Second_Symphony
was be%2:42:03::
lucid
,
intelligent
and
natural
sounding
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
not
a
heavy
,
ponderous
Beethoven
.
The
music
sang sing%2:36:00::
nicely
,
sprinted sprint%2:38:00::
evenly
when
necessary
,
was be%2:42:03::
properly
accented
and
balanced
.
The
Franck
symphonic_poem
,
``
Psyche
''
,
is be%2:42:03::
a
lush
,
sweet-sounding
affair
that
was be%2:42:03::
pleasant
to
encounter encounter%2:38:00::
once_again
.
Fortunate
for
the
music
itself
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
not
too
frequent
a
visitor
;
if
it
were be%2:42:03::
,
its
heavily
chromatic
harmonies
would
soon
become become%2:42:01::
cloying
.
Mr._Paray
resisted resist%2:33:00::
the
temptation
to
over-emphasize overemphasize%2:32:00::
the
melodic
elements
of
the
score
.
He
did
not
let let%2:41:00::
the
strings
,
for_instance
,
weep
,
whine
or
get get%2:30:00::
hysterical
.
His
interpretation
was be%2:42:03::
a
model
of
refinement
and
accuracy
.
And
in
the
Prokofieff
C
major
Piano_Concerto
,
with
Zadel_Skolovsky
as
soloist
,
he
was be%2:42:03::
an
admirable
partner
.
Mr._Skolovsky
's
approach
to
the
concerto
was be%2:42:03::
bold
,
sweeping
and
tonally
percussive
.
He
swept_through sweep_through%2:41:00::
the
music
with
ease
,
in
a
non-sentimental
and
ultra-efficient
manner
.
An
impressive
technician
,
Mr._Skolovsky
has have%2:40:00::
fine
rhythm
,
to_boot
.
His
tone
is be%2:42:03::
the
weakest
part
of
his
equipment
;
it
tends tend%2:42:01::
to
be be%2:42:03::
hard
and
colorless
.
A
school_of_thought
has have%2:40:00::
it
that
those
attributes
are be%2:42:03::
exactly
what
this
concerto
needs need%2:34:00::
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
,
after_all
,
a
non-romantic
work
(
even
with
the
big
,
juicy
melody
of
the
second
movement
)
;
and
the
composer
himself
was be%2:42:07::
called
the
``
age
of
steel
pianist
''
.
But
granted
all
this
,
one
still
would
have
liked like%2:37:01::
to
have
heard hear%2:39:00::
a_little
more
tonal
nuance
than
Mr._Skolovsky
supplied supply%2:40:00::
.
Taken take%2:31:03::
as_a_whole
,
though
,
it
was be%2:42:03::
a
strong
performance
from
both
pianist
and
orchestra
.
Mr._Skolovsky
fully
deserved deserve%2:42:00::
the
warm
reception
he
received receive%2:39:03::
.
A
new
work
on

Nikolai_Lopatnikoff

``

its

New_York
hearing

This
was
composed compose%2:36:03::
last
year
as
a
salute
to
the
automobile_industry

It
is be%2:42:03::
not

,
though

It
runs run%2:38:01::
a_little

``

,
like

of_course

it
is be%2:42:03::
a

Snow

were be%2:42:05::
present
in_force
at
the
Metropolitan_Opera
last
night
for

performance
of
the
Ponchielli
work

So
the
plot
creaks
,
the
sets
are
decaying
,
the
costumes
are
pre-historic
,
the
orchestra
was be%2:42:03::
sloppy
and
not_very_well
connected
with
what
the
singers
were
doing do%2:36:01::
.
After_all
,
the
opera
has have%2:40:00::
juicy
music
to
sing sing%2:36:01::
and
the
goodies
are be%2:42:03::
well
distributed
,
with
no_less_than
six
leading
parts

One
of
those
parts

that
of

evil
Barnaba

the
spy

His
wicked

who
was
taking take%2:41:00::
the
part

the
company
.
He
has have%2:40:00::
the
temperament
and
the
stage
presence
for
a
rousing
villain
and
he
sang sing%2:36:00::
with
character
and
strong
tone
.
What
was be%2:42:03::
lacking
was be%2:42:03::
a
real
sense
of
phrase
,
the
kind_of
legato
singing
that
would
have
added add%2:40:00::
a
dimension
of
smoothness
to
what
is be%2:42:03::
,
after_all
,
a
very
oily
character

Regina_Resnik

Cesare_Siepi
as
Alvise
also
were be%2:42:03::
new_to
the
cast
,
but
only
with_respect_to
this
season
;
they
have
both
sung sing%2:36:01::
these
parts
here
before

Laura
is be%2:42:03::
a
good
role
for
Miss_Resnik
,
and
she
gave give%2:40:03::
it
force

dramatic

Mr._Siepi
was be%2:42:03::
,
as

a

with
a_few
telling
strokes
he

Alvise
magnificently
.
Part
of_this
characterization
was
,
of_course
,
accomplished
with
the
vocal
chords
.
His
singing
was be%2:42:03::
strong
and
musical
;
unfortunately
his
voice
was be%2:42:03::
out
of
focus
and
often
spread
in
quality
.
Eileen_Farrell
in
the
title_role

Mignon_Dunn
as
La_Cieca
and
Richard_Tucker
as

were be%2:42:03::
holdovers

Since
rococo
music
tends tend%2:42:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
pretty
and

above_all

it
can
seem seem%2:39:00::

ears
that
have

accustomed_to
the

of

there

The
performances
were
assured
,
communicative
and
pleasingly
informal
.
What
was
omitted omit%2:31:01::
from
``
A
Neglected_Education
''
were be%2:42:03::
those
essentials
known_as
``
the
facts
of
life
''
.
Chabrier
's
little
one-act
operetta
,
presented present%2:39:00::
yesterday
afternoon
at
Town_Hall
,
is be%2:42:03::
a
fragile
,
precious
little
piece
,
very
French
,
not
without
wit
and
charm
.
The
poor
uneducated
newlywed
,
a
certain
Gontran
de
Boismassif
,
has have%2:40:00::
his
problems
in
getting get%2:40:00::
the
necessary
information
.
The
humor
of
the
situation
can
be
imagined imagine%2:36:00::
.
It
all
takes_place take_place%2:30:00::
in
the
eighteenth
century
.
What
a
silly
,
artificial
way_of_life
,
Chabrier
and
his
librettists
chuckle chuckle%2:29:00::
.
But
they
wish wish%2:32:02::
they
could
bring bring%2:35:04::
it
back
.
Chabrier
's
delightful
music
stands stand%2:42:04::
just
at
the
point
where
the
classical
,
rationalist
tradition
,
(
handed_down hand_down%2:40:00::
to
Chabrier
largely
in
the
form
of
operetta
and
salon
music
)
becomes become%2:42:01::
virtually
neo-classicism
.
The
musical
cleverness
and
spirit
plus
a
strong
sense_of_taste
and
measure
save
a
wry
little
joke
from
becoming become%2:42:01::
either
bawdy
or
mawkish
.
The
simple
,
clever
production
was be%2:42:03::
also
able
to
tread tread%2:35:01::
the
thin
line
between
those
extremes
.
Arlene_Saunders
was be%2:42:03::
charming
as
poor
Gontran
.
Yes
,
Arlene
is be%2:42:03::
her
name
;
the
work
uses use%2:34:01::
the
old
eighteenth-century
tradition
of
giving give%2:40:05::
the
part
of
a
young
inexperienced
youth
to
a
soprano
.
Benita_Valente
was be%2:42:03::
delightful
as
the
young
wife
and
John_Parella
was be%2:42:03::
amusing
as
the
tutor
who
failed fail%2:41:02::
to
do do%2:41:01::
all
his
tutoring
.
The
work
was
presented present%2:39:00::
as
the
final
event
in
the
Town_Hall
Festival
of
Music
.
It
was
paired pair%2:41:00::
with
a
Darius_Milhaud
opera
,
``
The
Poor_Sailor
''
,
set_to
a
libretto
by
Jean_Cocteau

a

,
unrecognized
,
and
gets get%2:30:00::
done_in do_in%2:35:00::
by
his
wife
.
With
the
exception
of
a_few
spots
,
Milhaud
's
music
mostly
churns churn%2:35:00::
away
with
his
usual
collection
of
ditties
,
odd
harmonies
,
and
lumbering
,
satiric
orchestration
.
