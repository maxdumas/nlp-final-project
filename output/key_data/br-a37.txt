At

made make%2:41:00::

Afterward
,
Tennessee

up

What
Herter
presented present%2:32:02::
,
said say%2:32:00::
Gore
,
was be%2:42:03::
``
not
a

That
was be%2:42:03::
something
of
an
understatement
in
a
week
when
the
underlying
conflict
between
the
West
and
Communism
erupted erupt%2:30:01::
on
three

While

were
undermining undermine%2:41:00::

two

Hours
after

Dictator_Fidel_Castro
suddenly
confronted confront%2:33:00::
the
U._S.
with
a
blunt
and
drastic
demand
:
within
48
hours
,
the
U._S.
had
to
reduce reduce%2:30:00::
its
embassy

consulate
staffs
in

an

Kennedy
,
through

declined decline%2:32:00::
.
He
thus
kept keep%2:42:00::
his
hands
free
for

action
after

,
although
reaction
to
the
break

generally
favorable
in
the
U._S.

After

the

reacted react%2:31:00::
sharply
to

as

exaggeration
(

that

There
was be%2:42:00::
a

of

the

did
not

,
in

it

``
not

encouraging

situation
that
would

John_F._Kennedy
on

As
the
87

Congress
began begin%2:30:01::
its
sessions
last

liberal

were be%2:42:03::
ready

The
liberal
pressure
bloc
(
which
coyly
masquerades masquerade%2:39:00::
under
the
name
Democratic
Study_Group
)
had
fought fight%2:33:01::
the
committee
before
,
and
had
always
lost lose%2:33:00::
.
This
time
,
they
were be%2:42:03::
much
better
prepared
and
organized
,
and
the
political
climate
was be%2:42:03::
favorable
.
They
had have%2:40:00::
the
unspoken
support
of
President-elect_Kennedy
,
whose
own
legislative
program
was
menaced menace%2:42:00::
by
the
Rules_Committee
bottleneck
.
And
counting count%2:32:00::

they
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
have have%2:40:00::
the

There
were be%2:42:00::
two
possible
methods
of

the
conservative
barriers
around
the
Rules_Committee
:
1

to
pack pack%2:38:02::
it

(
pronounced pronounce%2:32:01::

.
Caucusing caucus%2:41:00::
,
the
liberals
decided decide%2:31:00::
to
go_after go_after%2:38:01::
Colmer
,
which
actually
was be%2:42:03::
the
more
drastic
course
,
since
seniority
in
the
House
is be%2:42:03::
next
to
godliness
.
A
dour
,
gangling
man
with
a
choppy
gait
,
Colmer
looks look%2:39:01::
younger
than
his
70
years
,
has
gradually
swung swing%2:41:01::
from
a
moderate
,
internationalist
position

conservative

He
is be%2:42:03::

Gulf_Coast
constituents

He
is be%2:42:06::
,
of_course
,
a
segregationist
,
but
he
says say%2:32:01::
he
has
never
made make%2:41:00::
an
``
anti-Negro
''
speech
.
For
20
years
he
has
enjoyed enjoy%2:34:01::
his
power
on
the
Rules_Committee
.
There
his
vote
,
along
with
those
of
Chairman_Howard_Smith
,
the
courtly
Virginia
judge
,
and
the
four
Republican
members
,
could
and
often
did
produce produce%2:36:03::
a
6

6
deadlock
that
blocked block%2:41:00::
far-out
,
Democratic-sponsored
welfare
legislation
(
a
tactic
often
acceptable
to
the
Rayburn-Johnson
congressional
leadership
to
avoid avoid%2:41:01::
embarrassing
votes
)
.
There
was be%2:42:00::
sufficient
pretext
to
demand demand%2:32:00::
Colmer
's
ouster
:
he
had
given give%2:40:03::
his
lukewarm
support
to
the
anti-Kennedy
electors
in
Mississippi
.
Reprisals
are be%2:42:03::
not
unheard
of
in
such
situations

but
the
recent
tendency
has
been be%2:42:06::
for
the
Congress
to
forgive forgive%2:32:00::
its
prodigal
sons

In
1949
the
Dixiecrats
escaped escape%2:32:04::
unscathed
after
their
1948
rebellion

and
in
1957
,
after
Congressman_Adam_Clayton_Powell
campaigned campaign%2:41:10::
for
Dwight_Eisenhower
in
1956
,
his
fellow
Democrats
did
not
touch touch%2:35:03::
his
committee
assignments
,
although
they
did
strip strip%2:40:03::
him
temporarily
of
his
patronage
.
(
In
the
heat
of
the
anti-Colmer
drive
last
week
,
Judge_Smith
threatened threaten%2:32:00::
reprisal
against

Said say%2:32:00::
he
:

)
But
Speaker_Sam_Rayburn
,
after
huddling huddle%2:38:01::
in
Palm_Beach
with
President-elect_Kennedy
,
decided decide%2:31:00::
that
this
year
something
had
to
be
done do%2:41:01::
about
the
Rules_Committee
-
and
that
he
was be%2:42:06::
the
only
man
who
could
do do%2:41:01::
anything
effective
.
In
a
tense
,
closed-door
session
with
Judge_Smith
,
Rayburn
attempted attempt%2:41:00::
to
work_out work_out%2:30:00::
a
compromise
:
to
add add%2:30:00::
three
new
members
to
the
Rules_Committee
(
two
Democrats
,
including include%2:42:00::
one
Southerner
,
and
one
Republican
)
.
Smith
flatly
rejected reject%2:40:00::
the
offer
,
and
Mister_Sam
thereupon
decided decide%2:31:00::
to
join join%2:41:00::
the
rebels
.
The
next
morning
he
summoned summon%2:32:00::
a
group
of
top
Democrats
to
his
private
office
and
broke break%2:32:00::
the
news
:
he
would
lead lead%2:41:00::
the
fight

,
whom
he
is
said say%2:32:01::
to

News

Rayburn
's

leaked_out leak_out%2:32:00::

When
Missouri

Clarence_Cannon
got get%2:30:03::

he
turned turn%2:30:03::
purple

``

he

rushed_off rush_off%2:38:00::

Cannon

conservative
man

brought bring%2:35:04::

to
the
Smith-Colmer
forces
:
as

he

each

threat

was
another

As
the
battle

in

cloakrooms

caucuses
,
it
became
clear
that
Judge_Smith
could
lose lose%2:33:00::
.
His
highest
count

supporters
numbered number%2:42:00::

The

,
smelling smell%2:39:01::

were
faced face%2:33:00::
with

necessity

in

Democratic
Committee

on
the
floor
of

House
-
before
they
could
oust oust%2:41:00::
Colmer
.
(
One
big
question
:
If
Colmer
was
to
be
purged purge%2:41:00::
,
what
should
the

do do%2:41:01::
about
the

the

)
In_all

they
seemed seem%2:39:00::
certain
of
victory
-
especially
with
Sam_Rayburn
applying apply%2:41:05::
his

But
in
the
prospect

the
battle
loomed loom%2:42:06::
the
specter
of
losing lose%2:33:00::
a
costlier

If
the
Southerners
were be%2:42:03::
sufficiently

they
