Yet
the_most

problem
in

Church
's
program
of
evangelism
is be%2:42:04::
right
at

point
-
helping help%2:41:00::

the

A
study
of
major
denominational
membership
statistics
over
a
twenty-year
period
revealed reveal%2:32:00::
the
appalling
fact
that
nearly
40
per_cent
of
those
who
joined join%2:41:00::
the
Church
were
lost lose%2:40:02::
to
the
Church
within
seven
years
.
One
denomination
had have%2:42:00::
a
membership
of
1419833
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
under
study
,
and
twenty
years
later
its
membership
stood stand%2:42:06::
at
1541991
-
a
net
growth
of
only
122158

Yet
during
the
same
period
there
were be%2:42:04::
1080062
additions
.
Another
major
church
body
had have%2:42:00::
4499608
members
and
twenty
years
later
its
membership
stood stand%2:42:06::
at
4622444
.
During
this
time
4122354
new
members
were
brought bring%2:38:00::
into
the
fellowship
.
Still
another
denomination
had have%2:42:00::
7360187
members
twenty
years
ago
.
During
this
period
7484268
members
were
received receive%2:35:00::
,
yet
the
net
membership
now
is be%2:42:07::
only
9910741
.
These
figures
indicate indicate%2:32:01::
that
we
are
losing lose%2:40:02::
almost
as_many
as
we
are
receiving receive%2:35:00::
into
membership
.
This
problem
is
illustrated illustrate%2:32:00::
by
the
fact
that
many
local
churches
drop drop%2:41:01::
from
the
active
membership
rolls
each_year
as_many
as
they
receive receive%2:35:00::
into
the
fellowship
.
Studies
of
membership
trends
,
even
in
some
areas
where
population
is
expanding expand%2:30:01::
,
show show%2:32:00::
that
numbers
of

have

little

increase

though
many

were
received receive%2:35:00::

is be%2:42:06::
wrong

these
things
happen happen%2:30:00::
.
The
