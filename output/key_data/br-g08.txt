Thus
we

to
face face%2:32:00::
the
urbanization
of
the
South
-
an
urbanization
which
,
despite
its
dramatic
and
overwhelming
effects
upon
the
Southern
culture
,
has
been
utterly
ignored ignore%2:39:00::
by
the
bulk
of
Southern
writers
.
Indeed
,
it
seems seem%2:39:01::
that
only
in
today
's
Southern
fiction
does
Tobacco_Road
,
with
all
the
traditional
trimmings
of
sowbelly

cornbread
and

,
continue continue%2:42:01::

-
but
only
as
a

Those

Southern
school

have
received receive%2:30:01::
accolades
from
even
those
critics
least
prone
to
eulogize eulogize%2:32:00::
;
according
to
many
critics
,
in_fact
,
the
South
has
led lead%2:42:01::
the
North
in
literature
since
the
Civil_War
,
both
quantitatively
and
qualitatively
.
Such
writers
as
William_Faulkner
and
Robert_Penn_Warren
have
led lead%2:38:00::
the
field
of
somewhat
less
important
writers
in
a
sort_of
post-bellum
renaissance
.
It
is
interesting
,
however
,
that
despite
this
strong
upsurge
in
Southern
writing
,
almost
none
of
the
writers
has
forsaken forsake%2:31:00::
the
firmly
entrenched
concept
of
the
white-suited
big-daddy
colonel
sipping sip%2:34:00::
a
mint_julep
as
he
silently
recounts recount%2:32:00::
the
revenue
from
the
season

cotton
and
tobacco
crops

of
the
stereotyped
Negro
servants
chanting chant%2:32:00::
hymns
as
they
plow plow%2:36:00::
the
fields

of
these
and
a
host
of
other
antiquated
legends
that
deny deny%2:40:00::
the
South
its
progressive
leaps
of
the
past
century
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
not
to
say say%2:32:00::
that
the
South
is be%2:42:03::
no_longer
agrarian
;
such
a
statement
would
be be%2:42:03::
the
rankest
form
of
oversimplification
.
But
the
South
is
,
and
has
been
for
the
past
century
,
engaged engage%2:41:06::
in
a
wide-sweeping
urbanization
which
,
oddly_enough
,
is
not
reflected reflect%2:39:01::
in
its
literature
.
In
1900
the
South
was be%2:42:03::
only
15
%
urban
;
in
1950
it
had
become become%2:30:00::
47.1
%
urban
.
In
a
mere
half-century
the
South
has
more_than
tripled triple%2:30:00::
its
urban
status
.
There
is
a
New_South
emerging emerge%2:30:00::
,
a
South
losing lose%2:40:02::
the
folksy
traditions
of
an
agrarian
society
with
the
rapidity
of
an
avalanche
-
especially
within
recent
decades
.
As
the
New_South
snowballs snowball%2:30:00::
toward
further
urbanization
,
it
becomes become%2:30:00::
more_and_more
homogeneous
with
the
North
-
a
tendency
which
Willard_Thorp
terms term%2:32:00::
``
Yankeefication
''
,
as
evidenced evidence%2:32:00::
in
such
cities
as
Charlotte
,
Birmingham
,
and
Houston
.
It
is
said say%2:32:00::
that
,
even
at
the
present
stage
of
Southern
urbanization
,
such
a
city
as
Atlanta
is be%2:42:03::
not
distinctly
unlike
Columbus
or
Trenton
.
Undoubtedly
even
the
old
Southern
stalwart
Richmond
has
felt feel%2:39:01::
the
new
wind
:
William_Styron
mentions mention%2:32:02::
in
his
latest
novel
an
avenue
named name%2:32:03::
for
Bankhead_McGruder

a
Civil_War
general
,
now
renamed rename%2:32:00::
,
in
typical
California
fashion
,
``
Buena_Vista_Terrace
''
.
The
effects
of
television
and
other
mass_media
are
erasing erase%2:30:00::
regional
dialects
and
localisms
with
a
startling
force
.
As
for
progress
,
the
``
backward
South
''
can
boast boast%2:32:00::
of
Baton_Rouge
,
which
increased increase%2:30:02::
its
population
between
1940
and
1950
by
two
hundred
and
sixty-two
percent
,
to
126000
,
the
second
largest
growth
of
the
period
for
all
cities
over
25000
.
The
field
,
then
,
is be%2:42:03::
ripe
for
new
Southerners
to
step_to_the_fore step_to_the_fore%2:38:00::
and
write_of write_of%2:36:00::
this
twentieth-century
phenomenon

the

,
the
pains

transition
,
the
labor

the
list
is be%2:42:03::
,
obviously
,
endless
.
But
these
sources
have
not
been
tapped tap%2:34:00::
.
Truman_Capote
is
still
reveling revel%2:34:00::
in
Southern_Gothicism
,
exaggerating exaggerate%2:41:00::
the
old
Southern
legends
into
something
beautiful
and
grotesque

but
as
unreal
as
-
or
even
more
unreal
than
-
yesterday
.
William_Styron
,
while
facing face%2:32:00::
the
changing
economy
with
a
certain
uneasy
reluctance
,
insists insist%2:32:00::
he
is
not
to
be
classified classify%2:31:00::
as
a
Southern
writer
and
yet
includes include%2:42:00::
traditional
Southern
concepts
in
everything
he
publishes publish%2:36:00::
.
Even
the
great
god
Faulkner
,
the
South
's
one
probable
contender
for
literary
immortality
,
has
little
concerned concern%2:42:01::
himself
with
these
matters
;
such
are be%2:42:05::
simply
not
within
his
bounded
province
.
Where
are be%2:42:05::
the
writers
to
treat treat%2:32:00::
these
changes
?
Has
the
agrarian
tradition
become become%2:42:01::
such
an
addiction
that
the
switch
to
urbanism
is be%2:42:03::
somehow
dreaded
or
unwanted
?
Perhaps
present
writers
hypnotically
cling_to cling_to%2:35:00::
the
older
order
because
they
consider consider%2:31:00::
it
useful
and
reliable
through
repeated
testings
over
the
decades
.
Lacking lack%2:42:00::
the
pioneer
spirit
necessary
to
write_of write_of%2:36:00::
a
new
economy
,
these
writers
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
be
contenting content%2:34:00::
themselves
with
an
old
one
that
is be%2:42:03::
now
as
defunct
as
Confederate
money
.
An
example
of
the
changes
which
have
crept creep%2:38:00::
over
the
Southern
region
may
be
seen see%2:31:00::
in
the
Southern_Negro
's
quest
for
a
position
in
the
white-dominated
society
,
a
problem
that
has
been
reflected reflect%2:39:01::
in
regional
fiction
especially
since
1865
.
Today
the
Negro
must
discover discover%2:31:01::
his
role
in
an
industrialized
South
,
which
indicates indicate%2:32:01::
that
the
racial
aspect
of
the
Southern
dilemma
has
n't
changed change%2:30:01::
radically
,
but
rather
has
gradually
come come%2:30:01::
to
be be%2:42:03::
reflected reflect%2:39:01::
in_this
new
context
,
this
new
coat_of_paint
.
The
Negro
faces face%2:32:00::
as
much
,
if_not
more
,
difficulty
in
fitting fit%2:30:02::
himself
into
an
urban
economy
as
he
did_in
an
agrarian
one
.
This
represents represent%2:32:02::
a
gradual
change
in
an
ever-present
social
problem
.
But
there
have
been be%2:42:04::
abrupt_changes
as_well
:
the
sit-ins
,
the
picket_lines
,
the
bus
strikes
-
all_of
these
were be%2:42:03::
unheard-of
even
ten
years
ago
.
Today
's
evidence
,
such_as
the
fact
that
only
three
Southern
states
(
South_Carolina
,
Alabama
and
Mississippi
)
still
openly
defy defy%2:42:01::
integration
,
would
have
astounded astound%2:31:00::
many_of
yesterday
's
Southerners
into
speechlessness
.
Other
examples
of
gradual
changes
that
have
affected affect%2:30:00::
the
Negro
have
been be%2:42:06::
his
moving move%2:38:03::
up

in
the
busses
;
his
requesting request%2:32:01::
,
and
often
getting get%2:40:00::
,
higher
wages
,
better

conditions
,
better
schools
-
changes
that
were
slowly
emerging emerge%2:30:00::
even
before
the
Supreme_Court
decision
of
1954
.
Then
came come%2:30:01::
this
decision
,
which
sped speed%2:30:00::
the
process
of
gaining gain%2:40:03::
equality
(
or
perhaps
hindered hinder%2:41:00::
it
;
only
historical
evolution
will
determine determine%2:31:01::
which
)
:
an
abrupt_change
.
Since
1954
the
Negro
's
desire
for
social
justice
has
led lead%2:42:12::
to
an
ironically
anarchical
rebellion
.
He
has
frequently
refused refuse%2:32:00::
to
move move%2:38:03::
from
white
lunch
counters
,
refused refuse%2:32:00::
to
obey obey%2:41:00::
local
laws
which
he
considers consider%2:31:00::
unjust
,
while
in
other
cases
he
has
appealed_to appeal_to%2:32:00::
federal
laws
.
This
bold
self-assertion
,
after
decades
of
humble
subservience
,
is be%2:42:03::
indeed
a
twentieth-century
phenomenon
,
an
abrupt_change
in
the
Southern
way
of
existence
.
A
new
order
is
thrusting thrust%2:38:00::
itself
into
being
.
A
new
South
is
emerging emerge%2:30:00::
after
the
post-bellum
years
of
hesitation

and
lack
of

the
Negro
in
defining define%2:42:00::
his
new
role
in
the
amorphously
defined
socio-political
organizations
of
the
white_man
.
The
modern
Negro
has
not
made make%2:41:00::
a
decisive
debut
into
Southern
fiction
.
It
is
clear
that
,
while
most
writers
enjoy enjoy%2:37:00::
picturing picture%2:36:00::
the
Negro
as
a
woolly-headed
,
humble
old
agrarian
who
mutters
``
yassuhs
''
and
``
sho
'
nufs
''
with
blissful
deference
to
his
white
employer
(
or
,
in
Old_South
terms
,
``
massuh
''
)
,
this
stereotype
is
doomed doom%2:32:01::
to
become become%2:30:00::
in_reality
as
obsolete
as
Caldwell
's
Lester
.
While
there
may
still
be be%2:42:04::
many
Faulknerian
Lucas
Beauchamps
scattered
through
the
rural
South
,
such
men
appear appear%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
a
vanishing vanish%2:39:00::
breed
.
Writers
openly
admit admit%2:32:00::
that
the
Negro
is be%2:42:03::
easier
to
write write%2:36:02::
than
the
white_man
;
but
they
obviously
mean mean%2:32:01::
by
this
,
not
a

but
a
Negro

Presenting present%2:39:00::
an

character

it
would
seem seem%2:39:01::
,
is be%2:42:03::
one
of
the_most

Southern

could
tackle tackle%2:41:00::
;
and
the
success
of
such
an
endeavor
is be%2:42:03::
,
as
suggested suggest%2:32:02::
above

glaringly
rare
.
Just_as
the

Southern
life

it
also
points_up point_up%2:32:00::
the
non-representation

The
book
concerned concern%2:42:00::
with
the
Negro
's
role
in
an

is be%2:42:03::
rare
indeed
;
recently
only
Keith_Wheeler
's
novel
,
Peaceable_Lane
,
has
openly
faced face%2:32:00::
the
problem
.
All_but
the_most
rabid
of
Confederate_flag
wavers
admit admit%2:32:00::
that
the
Old_Southern
tradition
is be%2:42:03::
defunct

and
sigh sigh%2:32:01::
that
its
passing
was_accompanied_by
the
disappearance
of
many
genteel
and
aristocratic
traditions
of
the
reputedly
languid
ante-bellum
way_of_life
.
Many
earlier
writers
,
mourning mourn%2:37:00::
the
demise

tended tend%2:42:01::
to

Perhaps

they

Faulkner
does

his
awareness

the
changing change%2:30:00::
order
of
the
South
quite
keenly
,
as
can
be
proven prove%2:31:00::
by
a
quick
recalling
of
his
Sartoris
and
Snopes
families
.
Even
two
decades
ago
in
Go_Down
,
Moses_Faulkner
was
looking_to look_to%2:37:00::
the
more
urban
future
with
a
glimmer
of
hope
that
through
its
youth
and
its
new
way_of_life
the
South
might
be
reborn
and
the
curse
of
slavery
erased erase%2:30:00::

Yet
his
concern
even
here
is be%2:42:03::
with
a
slowly
changing
socio-economic
order
in_general

and
he
never

Faulkner

Thus
Faulkner
reminds remind%2:31:00::

that
