Roberta

to
back back%2:38:00::
toward

The

waved wave%2:35:00::

At

Dave
paused pause%2:42:00::
to
feel feel%2:39:10::
for
the
latch

Roberta
glanced glance%2:39:00::
up
at

He
was
going_to

sensible

not

anything

at

She
measured measure%2:30:00::
the
distance

stood stand%2:35:00::
to
the
men
and
the
gun
,
measured measure%2:30:00::
the
distance
from

men
to_the_back
room

She
decided decide%2:31:00::
to
risk risk%2:41:01::
it
.
There
was
something
phony
about
all
this
gun
waving
-
something
not_quite
what
it
seemed seem%2:39:00::
in
the
detailed
directions
for
finding find%2:40:00::

Dave
had have%2:40:00::
the
latch
under

thumb
now
and
he
removed remove%2:30:00::
his
arm
from
his
wife
in_order_to
pull pull%2:35:00::
the
door
open

In_a_flash
she
was be%2:42:03::
away
to_the_back
,
paying pay_attention%2:39:00::
no
attention
to
three
angry
shouts
from
the
male

She
tore tear%2:35:00::
open
the
back
door
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
dark
inside
the
room
but
enough
light
spilled spill%2:38:00::
from
the
restaurant
behind
her
to
enable enable%2:30:00::
her
to
make_out make_out%2:39:00::

There
was be%2:42:04::
a

perhaps
fifteen
wooden
chairs

Slowly
she
turned turn%2:38:00::
to
face face%2:33:00::
the
men
again

Rat-face
at
the
counter
was be%2:42:03::
on

feet

The
distance
between

stood stand%2:35:00::

waited wait%2:42:00::
at

Keeping keep%2:42:00::

gaze
on

she
began begin%2:30:00::
to
feel feel%2:40:00::
her
way

door

She
sidled sidle%2:38:00::
along
the
booths
one
step
at_a_time

The
gun
followed follow%2:38:00::
her

As
she
reached reach%2:38:00::
Dave

felt feel%2:39:00::
his

around

him

her

she
knew know%2:31:02::
with
the
certainty
of
despair
that
something
bad
had
happened happen%2:30:00::
to
Lauren

The
two
men
watched watch%2:41:00::
as
Dave
closed close%2:35:00::
the
door
behind
them
,
watched watch%2:41:00::
them
cross cross%2:38:00::
the
sidewalk

It
was
getting get%2:30:00::

zipped zip%2:35:00::
it
over

The
thin
man
moved move%2:38:03::
swiftly
to
the
phone
and
dialed dial%2:32:00::
a
number

When
he
was
answered answer%2:31:02::

he
said say%2:32:00::

He
turned turn%2:38:00::
from
the
phone
and
strode stride%2:38:04::
to
the
front
of
the
restaurant

The
white
Buick
had
n't
moved move%2:38:03::
away

Good

A
line
of
worry
formed form%2:42:02::

a
twitch

His

were be%2:42:03::
lowered

careful

quietly

His
mouth
worked work%2:35:02::
over

Barney
finished finish%2:30:02::
the
cigarette
he
had
been
smoking smoke%2:34:00::
.
He
dropped drop%2:38:01::
it
and
carefully
ground grind%2:35:00::
it
to
nothing
with
the
sole
of
his
heavy
shoe
.
Now
he
looked look%2:39:00::
at

He
said say%2:32:00::

``
I
only
work work%2:41:00::

Please

But
he
was be%2:42:03::
back
at_work
on
a
car
.
She
dropped drop%2:38:01::
her
head
on
her
arms
on
the
counter
.
How
could
he
be be%2:42:03::
kind
one
moment
and
cruel
the
next
?
Did
he
know know%2:31:01::
something
that
made make%2:32:00::
him
feel feel%2:37:00::
sad
and
sorry_for
her

And
was be%2:42:03::
he
afraid
to
do do%2:41:04::
anything
as
definite
as
releasing release%2:41:00::
her
?
Her
heart
was
thumping thump%2:38:00::
painfully
;
the
unknown
was be%2:42:03::
so_much
worse
than
-
what
dangers
lay lie%2:42:00::
ahead
for
her
?
What
awful
thing
had
she
to
face face%2:32:00::
in
the
next
few
hours
?
Something
wet
and
hot
was
trickling trickle%2:38:00::
on
her
wrists
.
Tears
?
With
a
sturdy
act
of
will
she
turned turn%2:30:00::
her
mind
away
from
herself
;
as
long
as
she
could
do do%2:41:01::
nothing
constructive
about
the
situation
she
was be%2:42:05::
in
,
she
would
think_about think_about%2:31:03::
something
else

Her
mother
and
father
,
for_instance
.
Where
were be%2:42:05::
they
now
?
In
her
mind
she
followed follow%2:38:00::
the
white
Buick
along
the
road
somewhere
between
here
and
the
Niagara_River
.
Her
father
's
attention
would
be be%2:42:05::
on
the
road
ahead
and
it
would
n't
deviate deviate%2:38:00::
an
inch
until
he
crossed cross%2:38:00::
the
bridge
at
the
Falls
and
took take%2:38:02::
the
River_Road
to
LaSalle
and
,
finally
,
turned_in turn_in%2:38:00::
at
their
own
driveway
at
387
Heather_Heights
.
Then
he
would
yawn yawn%2:29:00::
and
stretch stretch%2:29:01::
and
shout shout%2:32:00::
,
``
All

And
what
would
her

be
doing do%2:41:01::
right_now

Her
mother
would
be be%2:42:03::
fast
asleep
curled_up
against

safe

solid
shoulder
next

hand

arm

he
slid slide%2:38:01::
in
the

her

Somewhere
birds
were
sweetly
calling call%2:32:09::

were
answered answer%2:32:00::
.
Her
teeth
chattered chatter%2:39:00::
so_that

made make%2:41:00::
three
attempts
at
speech
before
she
became become%2:30:00::

He
inserted insert%2:30:00::
