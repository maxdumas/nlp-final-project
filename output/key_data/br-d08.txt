But
,
again

we

no

to

Thus
,
while
it

possible
that
the
Babylonians
and
/
or
the
Pythagoreans
may
perhaps
have
had have%2:40:00::
the
magic

three
before

Chinese
did
,
more
definite
evidence
will
have have%2:42:05::
to
turn_up turn_up%2:30:00::
from
the
Middle_East
or
the
Classical_World
before
China
can
lose lose%2:40:02::
her
claim
to
the
earliest
known
magic
square
by
more_than
a_thousand
years
.
The
concept
of
the
Middle_Kingdom
at_peace
,
strong
and
united
under
a
forceful
ruler
,
which
had
been be%2:42:03::
only
a
longed-for
ideal
in
the
time
of
the
Warring
States
,
was
finally
realized realize%2:36:00::
by
the
establishment
of
a
Chinese
Empire
under
the
Ch
'
in
dynasty
(
221
-
207
B.
C
.
)
.
But
this
was
only
accomplished accomplish%2:36:00::
by
excessive
cruelty
and
extremes
of
totalitarian
despotism
.
Among
the
many
severe
measures
taken take%2:41:04::
by
the
First_Emperor
,
Shih_Huang-ti
,
in
his
efforts
to
insure insure%2:31:00::
the
continuation
of_this
hard-won
national
unity
,
was be%2:42:06::
the
burning
of
the
books
in
213
B._C.
,
with
the
expressed
intention
of
removing remove%2:40:00::
possible
sources
for
divergent
thinking
;
but
,
as
he
had have%2:40:00::
a
special
fondness
for
magic
and
divination
,
he
ordered order%2:32:01::
that
books
on
these
subjects
should
be
spared spare%2:41:00::
.
Many_of
the
latter
were
destroyed destroy%2:35:00::
in
their
turn
,
during
the
burning
of
the
vast
Ch
'
in
palace
some
ten
years
later
;
yet
some
must
have
survived survive%2:42:00::
,
because
the
old
interest
in
number
symbolism
,
divination
,
and
magic
persisted persist%2:42:00::
on
into
the
Han
dynasty
,
which
succeeded succeed%2:41:00::
in
reuniting reunite%2:41:01::
China
and
keeping keep%2:42:00::
it
together
for
a
longer
period
(
from
202
B._C.
to
A._D.
220
)
.
In_fact
,
during
the
first
century
B._C.
,
an
extensive
literature
sprang_up spring_up%2:42:00::
devoted_to
these
subjects
,
finding find%2:30:00::
its
typical
expression
in
the
so-called
``
wei
books
''
,
a_number_of
which
were
specifically
devoted_to
the
Lo_Shu
and
related
numerical
diagrams
,
especially
in
connection
with
divination
.
However
,
the
wei
books
were
also
destroyed destroy%2:36:00::
in_a_series
of
Orthodox_Confucian
purges
which
culminated culminate%2:30:00::
in
a
final
proscription
in
605
.
After_all
this
destruction
of
old
literature
,
it
should
be be%2:42:03::
obvious
why
we
have have%2:40:00::
so
little
information
about
the
early
history
and
development
of
the
Lo_Shu
,
which
was be%2:42:03::
already
semisecret
anyhow
.
But
,
in_spite_of
all
this
,
enough
evidence
remains remain%2:42:05::
to
show show%2:32:00::
that
the
magic
square
of
three
must
indeed
have
been be%2:42:03::
the
object
of
a
rather
extensive
cult
-
or
series
of
cults
-
reaching reach%2:38:00::
fullest
expression
in
the
Han
period
.
Although
modern
scholars
have
expressed express%2:32:01::
surprise
that
``
the
simple
magic
square
of
three
''
,
a
mere
``
mathematical
puzzle
''
,
was be%2:42:03::
able_to
exert exert%2:34:00::
a
considerable
influence
on
the
minds
and
imaginations
of
the
cultured
Chinese
for
so
many
centuries
,
they
could
have
found find%2:40:02::
most_of
the
answers
right
within
the
square
itself
.
But
,
up_to_now
,
no
one
has
attempted attempt%2:41:00::
to
analyze analyze%2:31:00::
its
inherent
mathematical
properties
,
or
the
numerical
significance
of
its
numbers
-
singly
or
in
combination
-
and_then
tried try%2:41:00::
to
consider consider%2:39:00::
these
in
the
light
of
Old
Chinese
cosmological
concepts
.
Such
an
analysis
speedily
reveals reveal%2:39:00::
why
the
middle
number
of
the
Lo_Shu
,
5
,
was be%2:42:03::
so
vitally
significant
for
the
Chinese
ever
since
the
earliest
hints
that
they
had have%2:40:00::
a
knowledge
of_this
diagram
.
The
importance
of_this
5
can
largely
be
explained explain%2:32:00::
by
the
natural
mathematical
properties
of
the
middle
number
and
its
special
relationship
to
all
the
rest
of
the
numbers
-
quite
apart
from
any
numerological
considerations
,
which
is be%2:42:06::
to
say say%2:32:00::
,
any
symbolic
meaning
arbitrarily
assigned assign%2:31:02::
to
it
.
Indeed
,
mathematically
speaking speak%2:32:01::
,
it
was be%2:42:03::
both
functionally
and
symbolically
the_most
important
number
in
the
entire
diagram
.
If
one
takes take%2:31:01::
the
middle
number
,
5
,
and
multiplies multiply%2:31:00::
it
by
3
(
the
base
number
of
the
magic
square
of
three
)
,
the
result
is be%2:42:06::
15
,
which
is be%2:42:06::
also
the
constant
sum
of
all
the
rows
,
columns
,
and
two
main
diagonals
.
Then
,
if
the
middle
number
is
activated activate%2:30:00::
to
its
greatest
potential
in_terms_of
this
square
,
through
multiplying multiply%2:31:00::
it
by
the
highest
number
,
9
(
which
is be%2:42:06::
the
square
of
the
base
number
)
,
the
result
is be%2:42:06::
45
;
and
the
latter
is be%2:42:07::
the
total
sum
of
all
the
numbers
in
the
square
,
by
which
all
the
other
numbers
are
overshadowed overshadow%2:42:00::
and
in_which
they
may
be
said say%2:32:00::
to
be
absorbed absorb%2:30:00::
.
Furthermore
,
the
middle
number
of
the
Lo_Shu
is be%2:42:06::
not_only
the
physical
mean
between
every
opposing
pair
of
the
other
numbers
,
by
reason
of
its
central
position
;
it
is be%2:42:06::
also
their
mathematical
mean
,
since
it
is be%2:42:03::
equal equal%2:42:00::
to
half
the
sum
of
every
opposing
pair
,
all_of
which
equal
10
.
In_fact
,
the
neat
balance
of
these
pairs
,
and
their
subtle
equilibrium
,
would
have
had have%2:40:00::
special
meaning
in
the
minds
of
the
Old
Chinese
.
For
they
considered consider%2:31:00::
the
odd
numbers
as
male
and
the
even
ones
as
female
,
equating equate%2:31:00::
the
two
groups
with
the
Yang
and
Yin
principles
in
Nature
;
and
in_this
square
,
the
respective
pairs
made_up make_up%2:42:00::
of
large
and
small
odd
(
Yang
)
numbers
,
and
those
composed compose%2:42:00::
of
large
and
small
even
(
Yin
)
numbers
,
were be%2:42:03::
all
equal_to
each
other
.
Thus
all
differences
were
leveled level%2:35:01::
,
and
all
contrasts
erased erase%2:30:00::
,
in
a
realm
of
no
distinction
,
and
the
harmonious
balance
of
the
Lo_Shu
square
could
effectively
symbolize symbolize%2:32:00::
the
world
in
balanced
harmony
around
a
powerful
central
axis
.
The
tremendous
emphasis
on
the
5
in
the
Lo_Shu
square
-
for
purely
mathematical
reasons
-
and
the
fact
that
this
number
so
neatly
symbolized symbolize%2:32:00::
the
heart
and
center
of
the
universe
,
could
well
explain explain%2:32:00::
why
the
Old
Chinese
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
have
so
revered revere%2:37:00::
the
number
5
,
and
why
they
put put%2:35:05::
so_much
stress
on
the
concept
of
Centrality
.
These
twin
tendencies
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
have
reached reach%2:38:00::
their
height
in
the
Han
dynasty
.
The
existing
reverence
for
Centrality
must
have
been
still
further
stimulated stimulate%2:30:00::
toward
the
close
of
the
second
century
B._C.
,
when
the
Han_Emperor_Wu_Ti
ordered order%2:32:01::
the
dynastic
color
changed change%2:30:01::
to
yellow
-
which
symbolized symbolize%2:32:00::
the
Center
among
the
traditional
Five
Directions
-
and
took take%2:31:01::
5
as
the
dynastic
number
,
believing believe%2:31:00::
that
he
would
thus
place place%2:35:00::
himself
,
his
imperial
family
,
and
the
nation
under
the_most
auspicious
influences
.
His
immediate
motive
for
doing do%2:41:01::
this
may may%2:42:01::
not
have
been
directly
inspired inspire%2:37:00::
by
the
Lo_Shu
,
but
this
measure
must
inevitably
have
increased increase%2:30:02::
the
existing
beliefs
in
the
latter
's
efficacy
.
After
this
time
,
inscriptions
on
the
Han
bronze
mirrors
,
as_well
as
other
writings
,
emphasized emphasize%2:30:00::
the
desirability
of
keeping keep%2:42:00::
one
's
self
at
the
center
of
the
universe
,
where
cosmic
forces
were be%2:42:03::
strongest
.
Later
,
we
shall
see see%2:31:02::
what
happened happen%2:30:00::
when
an
emperor
took take%2:31:07::
this
idea
too
literally
.
All
this
emphasis
on
Centrality
and
on
the
number
5
as
a
symbolic
expression
of
the
Center
,
which
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
have
begun begin%2:42:00::
as
far
back
as
400
B._C.
,
also
may
conceivably
have
led lead%2:41:12::;2:42:12::
to
the
development
of
the
Five-Elements_School
and
the
subsequent
efforts
to
fit fit%2:30:01::
everything
into
numerical
categories
of
five
.
We
find find%2:40:02::
,
for_example
,
such
groupings
as
the
Five
Ancient
Rulers
,
the
Five
Sacred
Mountains
,
the
Five
Directions
(
with
Center
)
,
the
Five
Metals
,
Five
Colors
,
Five
Tastes
,
Five
Odors
,
Five
Musical_Notes
,
Five
Bodily_Functions
,
Five
Viscera
,
and
many
others
.
This
trend
has
often
been
ascribed ascribe%2:31:00::
to
the
cult
of
the
Five
Elements
itself
,
as
though
they
had
served serve%2:42:03::
as
the
base
for
all
the
rest
;
but
why
did
the
Old
Chinese
postulate postulate%2:31:00::
five
elements
,
when
the
Ancient
Near
East
-
which
may
have
initiated initiate%2:36:01::
the
idea
that
natural
elements
exerted exert%2:34:00::
influence
in
human
life
and
activities
-
recognized recognize%2:31:02::
only
four
?
And
why
did
the
Chinese
suddenly
begin begin%2:30:00::
to
talk_about talk_about%2:32:00::
the
Five
Directions
,
when
the
animals
they
used use%2:34:01::
as
symbols
of
the
directions
designated designate%2:32:00::
only
the
usual
four
?
Obviously
,
something
suddenly
caused cause%2:32:00::
them
to
start start%2:30:00::
thinking think%2:31:00::
in_terms_of
fives
,
and
that
may
have
been be%2:42:06::
the
workings
of
the
Lo_Shu
.
This
whole
tendency
had have%2:30:01::
an
unfortunate
effect
on
Chinese
thinking
.
Whereas
the
primary
meanings
of
the
Lo_Shu
diagram
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
have
been
based base%2:31:00::
on
its
inner
mathematical
properties
-
and
we
shall
see see%2:31:02::
that
even
its
secondary
meanings
rested_on rest_on%2:42:00::
some
mathematical
bases
-
the
urgent
desire
to
place place%2:35:00::
everything
into
categories
of
fives
led lead%2:42:12::
to
other
groupings
based base%2:31:00::
on
other
numbers
,
until
an
exaggerated
emphasis
on
mere
numerology
pervaded pervade%2:35:00::
Chinese
thought
.
Scholars
made make%2:36:00::
numbered
sets
of
as_many
things
as
possible
in
Nature
,
or
assigned assign%2:31:00::
arbitrary
numbers
to
individual
things
,
in
a
fashion
that
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
the
modern
scientific
mind
as
downright
nonsensical
,
and
philosophical
ideas
based base%2:31:00::
upon
all
this
tended tend%2:42:00::
to
stifle stifle%2:30:00::
speculative
thought
in
China
for
many
centuries
.
Although
the
primary
mathematical
properties
of
the
middle
number
at
the
center
of
the
Lo_Shu
,
and
the
interrelation
of
all
the
other
numbers
to_it
,
might
seem seem%2:39:00::
enough
to
account_for account_for%2:42:00::
the
deep
fascination
which
the
Lo_Shu
held hold%2:40:00::
for
the
Old
Chinese
philosophers
,
this
was be%2:42:03::
actually
only
a
beginning
of
wonders
.
For
the
Lo_Shu
square
was be%2:42:03::
a
remarkably
complete
compendium
of
most_of
the
chief
religious
and
philosophical
ideas
of
its
time
.
As_such
,
one
cannot
fully
understand understand%2:31:00::
the
thought
of
the
pre-Han
and
Han
periods
without
knowing know%2:31:01::
the
meanings
inherent
in
the
Lo_Shu
;
but
,
conversely
,
one
cannot
begin begin%2:30:00::
to
understand understand%2:31:00::
the
Lo_Shu
without
knowing know%2:31:01::
something
about
the
world_view
of
the
Old
Chinese
,
which
they
felt feel%2:31:00::
they
saw see%2:39:02::
expressed express%2:32:02::
in

.
The
Chinese
world_view
during
the
Han
dynasty
,
when
the
Lo_Shu
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
have
been be%2:42:05::
at
the
height
of
its
popularity
,
was
based base%2:31:00::
in
large
part
on
the
teachings
of
the
Yin-Yang
and
Five-Elements_School
,
which
was
traditionally
founded found%2:41:00::
by
Tsou_Yen
.
According accord%2:42:00::
to
this
doctrine
,
the
universe
was
ruled rule%2:41:00::
by
Heaven
,
T
'
ien
-
as
a
natural
force
,
or
in
the
personification
of
a
Supreme_Sky-god
-
governing govern%2:41:01::
all
things
by
means
of
a
process
called
the
Tao
,
which
can
be
roughly
interpreted interpret%2:32:01::
as
``
the
Order
of
the
Universe
''
or
``
the
Universal
Way
''
.
Heaven
,
acting act%2:41:00::
through
the
Tao
,
expressed express%2:32:01::
itself
by
means
of
the
workings
of
two
basic_principles
,
the
Yin
and
the
Yang
.
The
Yang
,
or
male
principle
,
was be%2:42:03::
the
source
of
light
,
heat
,
and
dynamic
vitality
,
associated
with
the
Sun
;
while
the
Yin
,
or
female
principle
,
flourished flourish%2:30:01::
in_darkness
,
cold
,
and
quiet
inactivity
,
and
was
associated
with
the
Moon
.
Together
these
two
principles
influenced influence%2:41:00::
all
things
,
and
in
varying
combinations
they
were be%2:42:04::
present
in
everything
.
We
have
already
seen see%2:31:02::
that
odd
numbers
were
considered consider%2:31:00::
as
being be%2:42:03::
Yang
,
while
the
even
numbers
were be%2:42:03::
Yin
,
so_that
the
eight
outer
numbers
of
the
Lo_Shu
represented represent%2:42:02::
these
two
principles
in
balanced
equilibrium
around
the
axial
center
.
During
the
Han
dynasty
,
another
Yin-Yang
conception
was
applied apply%2:42:01::
to
the
Lo_Shu
,
considering consider%2:31:00::
the
latter
as
a
plan
of
Ancient_China
.
Instead
of
linking link%2:31:00::
the
nine
numbers
of_this
diagram
with
the
traditional
Nine
Provinces
,
as
was
usually
done do%2:41:01::
,
this
equated equate%2:31:00::
the
odd
,
Yang
numbers
with
mountains
(
firm
and
resistant
,
hence
Yang
)
and
the
even
numbers
with
rivers
(
sinuous
and
yielding
,
hence
Yin
)
;
taking take%2:31:01::
the
former
from
the
Five
Sacred
Mountains
of
the
Han
period
and
the
latter
from
the
principal
river
systems
of
Old_China
.
Thus
the
middle
number
,
5
,
represented represent%2:32:02::
Sung-Shan
in
Honan
,
Central_China
;
the
3
,
T

ai-Shan
in
Shantung
