Sir

We
are
writing write%2:32:00::
in
reference_to
a
recent
``
suggestion
''
made make%2:41:00::
to
the
staff
of
the
Public_Health_Nursing_Service
of
Jersey_City
(
registered
professional
nurses
with
college
background
and
varying
experiences
)
.
The
day
before
Election_Day
,
to_which
we
are
entitled entitle%2:41:00::
as
a
legal_holiday
,
we
were
informed inform%2:32:00::
to
report report%2:32:03::
to
our
respective
polls
to
work work%2:41:06::
as
``
workers
of
the
party
''
.
Being be%2:42:03::
ethical
and
professional
people
interested
in
community
health
and
well-being
,
we
felt feel%2:31:00::
this
was be%2:42:03::
n't
a
function
of
our
position
.
Such
tactics
reek reek%2:39:13::
of
totalitarianism
!
As
we
understand understand%2:31:02::
,
this
directive
was
given give%2:32:01::
to
all
city
and
county
employes
.
To
our
knowledge
no
nurse
in
our
agency
has
been
employed employ%2:41:00::
because
of
political
affiliation
.
We
,
therefore
,
considered consider%2:31:00::
the
``
suggestion
''
an
insult
to
our
intelligence
,
ethics
,
Bill_of_Rights
,
etc.
.
Our
only
obligation
for
this
day
is be%2:42:06::
to
vote vote%2:41:13::
,
free_of
persuasion
,
for
the
person
we
feel feel%2:31:00::
is be%2:42:03::
capable
in
directing direct%2:38:00::
the
public
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
our
duty
-
not
as
nurses
or
city
employes
-
but
as
citizens
of
the
United_States
.
Sir
-
I
read read%2:31:00::
of
a
man
who
felt feel%2:31:00::
he
should
not
build build%2:36:00::
a
fallout
shelter
in
his
home
because
it
would
be be%2:42:03::
selfish
for
him
to
sit sit%2:42:00::
secure
while
his
neighbors
had have%2:40:04::
no
shelters
.
Does
this
man
live live%2:42:08::
in
a
neighborhood
where
all
are be%2:42:03::
free
loaders
unwilling
to
help help%2:41:00::
themselves
,
but
ready_to
demand demand%2:32:00::
that
``
the
community
''
help help%2:41:00::
and
protect protect%2:33:00::
them
?
Community
shelters
are be%2:42:03::
,
of_course
,
necessary
for
those
having have%2:40:04::
no
space
for
shelter
.
If
in
a
town
of
2000
private
homes
,
half
of
them
have have%2:40:04::
shelters
,
the
need
for
the
community
shelters
will
be
reduced reduce%2:30:00::
to
that
extent
.
In
designing design%2:36:01::
his
home
fallout
shelter
there
is
nothing
to
prevent prevent%2:41:00::
a
man
from
planning
to
shelter shelter%2:42:00::
that
home
's
occupants
,
``
plus-one
''
-
so
he
will
be be%2:42:03::
able
to
take_in take_in%2:42:00::
a
stranger
.
I
hope hope%2:37:01::
the
man
who
plans plan%2:31:01::
to
sit sit%2:42:00::
on
his
hands
until
the
emergency
comes come%2:30:01::
will
have have%2:39:06::
a
change
of
heart
,
will
get get%2:30:00::
busy
and
be be%2:42:03::
the
first
member
of
our
``
plus-one
''
shelter
club
.
Sir
-
People
continue continue%2:42:01::
to
inquire inquire%2:31:00::
the
reason
for
the
race
for
outer_space
.
It
's be%2:42:03::
simple
enough
from
my
point_of_view
.
I
am be%2:42:03::
for
it
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
the
only
method
left
for
a
man
to
escape_from escape_from%2:38:00::
a
woman
's
world
.
Sir
-
When
the_colonies
decided decide%2:31:00::
upon
freedom
from
England
,
we
insisted insist%2:32:00::
,
through
the
Declaration_of_Independence
,
that
the
nations
of
the
world
recognize recognize%2:31:02::
us
as
a
separate
political
entity
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
high_time
the
United_States
began begin%2:30:00::
to
realize realize%2:31:00::
that
the
God-given
rights
of
men
set_forth set_forth%2:32:00::
in_that
document
are be%2:42:03::
applicable
today
to
Katanga
.
In
the
United_Nations
Charter
,
the
right
of
self-determination
is be%2:41:00::
also
an
essential
principle
.
This
,
again
,
applies apply%2:42:00::
to
Katanga
.
The
people
of
Katanga
had
fought fight%2:41:10::;2:33:01::;2:33:00::
for
,
and
obtained obtain%2:40:00::
,
their
freedom
from
the
Communist
yoke
of
Antoine_Gizenga
,
and
his
cohorts
.
By
political
,
economic
,
geographic
and
natural
standards
,
they
were be%2:42:03::
justified
in
doing
so
.
The
United_States
and
the
U._N.
denounce denounce%2:32:02::
their
own
principles
when
they
defend defend%2:32:00::
the
Communist
oppressors
and
refuse refuse%2:40:00::
to
acknowledge acknowledge%2:31:00::
the
right
of
self-determination
of
the
Katangans
.
Sir
-
Permit permit%2:32:00::
me
to
commend commend%2:32:00::
your
editorial
in_which
you
stress stress%2:32:00::
the
fact
that
a
program
of
county
colleges
will
substantially
increase increase%2:30:02::
local
tax
burdens
and
that
taxpayers
have have%2:40:00::
a
right
to
a
clear
idea
of_what
such
a
program
would
commit commit%2:32:01::
them
to
.
The
bill
which
passed pass%2:41:02::
the
Assembly
last
May
and
is be%2:42:03::
now
pending
in
the
Senate
should
be
given give%2:31:02::
careful
scrutiny
.
The
procedure
for
determining determine%2:31:03::
the
amounts_of_money
to
be
spent spend%2:40:00::
by
county
colleges
and
raised raise%2:40:00::
by
taxation
will
certainly
startle startle%2:37:00::
many
taxpayers
.
Under
the
proposal
the
members
of
the
board_of_trustees
of
a
county
college
will
be
appointed appoint%2:41:01::
;
none
will
be
elected elect%2:41:00::
.
The
trustees
will
prepare prepare%2:36:00::
an
annual
budget
for
the
college
and
submit submit%2:41:00::
it
to
the
board
of
school
estimate
.
This
board
will
consist_of consist_of%2:42:00::
two
of
the
trustees
of
the
college
,
and
the
director
and
two
members
of
the
board
of
freeholders
.
It
will
determine determine%2:31:03::
the
amount_of_money
to
be
spent spend%2:40:00::
by
the
college
and
will
certify certify%2:40:02::
this
amount
to
the
board
of
freeholders
,
which
``
shall
appropriate appropriate%2:31:00::
in
the
same
manner
as
other
appropriations
are
made make%2:41:00::
by
it
the
amount
so
certified
and
the
amount
shall
be
assessed assess%2:31:00::
,
levied levy%2:40:00::
and
collected collect%2:40:00::
in
the
same
manner
as
moneys
appropriated appropriate%2:31:00::
for
other
purposes
''
.
The
approval
of
only
three
members
of
the
board
of
school
estimate
is be%2:42:03::
required
to
certify certify%2:40:02::
the
amount_of_money
to
be
allotted allot%2:40:02::
to
the
college
.
Since
two
of
these
could
be be%2:42:03::
trustees
of
the
college
,
actually
it
would
be be%2:42:03::
necessary
to
have have%2:40:00::
the
consent
of
only
one
elected_official
to
impose impose%2:40:00::
a
levy
of
millions
of
dollars
of
tax_revenue
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
taxation
without
representation
.
Sir
-
Your
editorial
,
``
Housing
Speedup
''
,
is be%2:42:03::
certainly
not
the
answer
to
our
slum
problems
.
The
very
rules
and
regulations
in
every
city
are be%2:42:03::
the
primary
case
of
slum
conditions
.
Change change%2:30:01::
our
taxing
law
so_that
no
tax
shall
be
charged charge%2:40:03::
to
any
owner
for
additions
or
improvements
to
his
properties
.
Then
see see%2:31:02::
what
a
boom
in_all
trades
,
as_well
as
slum
clearance
at
no
cost
to
taxpayers
,
will
happen happen%2:30:00::
.
Our
entire
economy
will
have have%2:39:06::
a
terrific
uplift
.
Sir

An
old_man
is
kicked kick%2:35:00::
to
death
by
muggers
.
The
medical_examiner
states state%2:32:00::
that
death
was be%2:42:03::
due
to
``
natural
causes
''
.
I
once
heard hear%2:39:00::
a
comedian
say say%2:32:00::
that
if
you
are
killed kill%2:35:00::
by
a
taxicab
in
New_York
,
it
is
listed list%2:41:00::
as

Sir

Every
resident
of_this

should
visit visit%2:41:02::
the
Newark_Museum
and
see see%2:41:10::
the
exhibit
``
Our
Changing
Skyline
in
Newark
''
.
It
will
be be%2:42:04::
at
the
museum
until
March
30
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
a
revelation
of_what
has
been
done do%2:36:01::
,
what
is
being
done do%2:36:01::
and
what
will
be
done do%2:36:01::
in
Newark
as
shown show%2:31:00::
by
architects

It
shows show%2:31:00::
what
a
beautiful
city
Newark
will
become become%2:42:01::
and
certainly
make make%2:36:00::
every
Newarker
proud_of
this
city

It
should
also
make make%2:36:00::
him
desire desire%2:37:00::
to
participate participate%2:41:00::
actively
in
civic
,
school

religious
life
of
the
community
so_that
that
phase
of
Newark
will
live_up_to live_up_to%2:42:00::
the
challenge
presented present%2:32:00::
by
this
exhibit
.
Sir
-
I
hasten hasten%2:38:00::
to
join join%2:41:00::
in
praise
of
the
men
in
the
toll
booths
on
the
Garden_State
Parkway
.
Recently
I
traveled travel%2:38:00::
the
parkway
from
East_Orange
to
Cape_May
and
I
found find%2:40:02::
the_most
courteous
group
of
men
you
will
find find%2:40:02::
anywhere
.
One
even
gave give%2:40:01::
my
little_dog
a
biscuit
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
very
refreshing
.
The
viewers
of
the
``
deep
Peep_Show
''
at
15
th
and
M
streets
nw.
have have%2:40:00::
an
added
attraction
-
the
view
of
a
fossilized
cypress
swamp
.
Twenty
feet
below
the
street
level
in
the
excavation
of
the
new
motel
to
be
constructed construct%2:36:00::
on
this
site
,
a
black
coal-like
deposit
has
been
encountered encounter%2:38:00::
.
This
is be%2:42:03::
a
black
swamp
clay
in_which
about
one_hundred
million
years
ago
cypress-like
trees
were
growing grow%2:30:02::
.
The
fossilized
remains
of
many_of
these
trees
are
found find%2:39:02::
embedded
in
the
clay
.
Some
of
the
stumps
are be%2:42:03::
as
much_as
three
feet
long
,
but
most_of
them
have
been
flattened flatten%2:30:01::
by
the
pressure
of
the
overlying
sediments
.
Although
the
wood
has
been
changed change%2:30:01::
to
coal
,
much
of_it
still
retains retain%2:40:01::
its
original
cell
structure
.
In
the
clay
are
entombed entomb%2:41:00::
millions
of
pollen
grains
and
spores
which
came come%2:42:04::
from
plants
growing grow%2:30:02::
in
the
region
at_the_time
.
These
microfossils
indicate indicate%2:32:01::
the
swamp
was
``
formed form%2:42:02::
during
the
Lower
Cretaceous_period
when
dinosaurs
were be%2:42:03::
at
their
heyday
and
when
the
first
flowering_plants
were
just
appearing appear%2:30:02::
.
The
15
th
Street
deposit
is be%2:42:03::
not
to
be
confused confuse%2:31:02::
with
the
nearby
famous
Mayflower_Hotel
cypress
swamp
on
17
th
Street
reported report%2:32:00::
in
The
Washington_Post
,
August
2
,
1955
,
which
was
probably
formed form%2:42:02::
during
the
second
interglacial
period
and
is be%2:42:03::
therefore
much
younger
.
Recently
the
secretary
of
the
Friends
Committee
on
National
Legislation
was
interviewed interview%2:32:00::
on
the
air
.
While
I
respect respect%2:31:00::
his
sincere
concern
for
peace
,
he
made make%2:31:00::
four
points
that
I
would
like like%2:37:01::
to
question question%2:32:01::
.
He
said say%2:32:00::
,
``
Let
's
work work%2:41:02::
for
peace
instead
of
protection
from
aggression
''
.
I
would
ask ask%2:32:00::
,
``
Why
not
do do%2:41:01::
both
''
?
Military
power
does
not
cause cause%2:36:00::
war
;
war
is be%2:42:03::
the
result
of
mistrust
and
lack
of
understanding
between
people
.
Are be%2:42:03::
we
not_late
,
especially
those
of
us
who
call call%2:32:02::
ourselves
Friends
,
in
doing do%2:36:01::
enough
about
this
lack
of
understanding
?
As
to
protection
,
the
speaker
disapproved disapprove%2:31:00::
of
shelters
,
pointing_out point_out%2:32:01::
that
fallout
shelters
would
not
save save%2:41:00::
everyone
.
Is be%2:42:03::
this
a
reason
for
saving save%2:41:00::
no
one
?
Would
the
man
with
an
empty
life
boat
row row%2:38:00::
away
from
a
shipwreck
because
his
boat
could
not
pick_up pick_up%2:38:00::
everyone
?
The
speaker
suggested suggest%2:32:04::
that
the
desolation
of
a
post-attack
world
would
be be%2:42:03::
too
awful
to
face face%2:32:00::
.
If
the
world
comes come%2:30:03::
to
this
,
would
n't
it
be be%2:42:03::
the
very
time
when
courage
and
American
know-how
would
be
needed need%2:34:00::
to
help help%2:41:00::
survivors
rebuild rebuild%2:36:00::
?
Many_of
our
young
people
think think%2:31:01::
it
would
.
Lastly
,
the
speaker
decried decry%2:32:00::
our
organized
program
of
emergency
help
calling call%2:32:02::
it
``
Civilian_Defense
''
.
In
1950
,
Public_Law
920
created create%2:36:00::
Civil_Defense
(
different
from
Civilian-groups
of
World_War
2
,
)
,
a
responsibility
of
the
Government
at_all
levels
to
help help%2:41:00::
reduce reduce%2:30:00::
loss
of
life
and
property
in
disaster
,
natural
or
manmade
.
Far
from
creating create%2:36:00::
fear
,
as
the
speaker
suggests suggest%2:32:04::
,
preparedness
-
knowing know%2:31:01::
what
to
do do%2:41:01::
in
an
emergency
-
gives give%2:40:03::
people
confidence
.
Civil_Defense
has have%2:40:01::
far
to
go go%2:30:02::
and
many
problems
to
solve solve%2:31:00::
,
but
is be%2:42:03::
it
not
in
the
best
spirit
of
our
pioneer
tradition
to
be be%2:42:03::
not_only
willing
,
but
prepared
to
care care%2:41:13::
for
our
own
families
and
help help%2:41:00::
our
neighbors
in
any
disaster
-
storm
,
flood
,
accident
or
even
war
?
It
seems seem%2:39:01::
rather
peculiar
that
residents
of
apartments
are
denied deny%2:40:01::
the
right
of
providing provide%2:40:00::
themselves
with
the
protection
and
companionship
of
dogs
.
I
feel feel%2:31:00::
that
few
burglars
would
be be%2:42:03::
prone
to
break break%2:41:11::
and
enter enter%2:38:00::
into
someone
's
apartment
if
they
were
met meet%2:42:00::
with
a
good
hardy
growl
that
a
dog
would
provide provide%2:40:00::
.
In_addition
,
would
not
the
young
female
public
of
Washington
be
afforded afford%2:40:00::
a
greater
degree
of
protection
at
night
when
they
are be%2:42:05::
on
the
streets
if
they
were
accompanied accompany%2:38:00::
by
a
dog
on
a
leash
?
I
grant grant%2:32:00::
that
the
dog
may
not
be be%2:42:03::
really
protective
,
based base%2:31:00::
on
his
training
,
but
if
you
were
roaming roam%2:38:00::
the
streets
looking_for look_for%2:35:00::
a
purse
to
snatch snatch%2:35:00::
or
a
young_lady
to
molest molest%2:41:00::
,
how
quick
would
you
be be%2:42:03::
to
attack attack%2:33:02::
a
person
strolling stroll%2:38:01::
with
a
dog
?
I
would
like like%2:37:01::
to
suggest suggest%2:32:00::
that
the
landlords
and
Commissioners
get get%2:30:00::
together
and
consider consider%2:32:02::
liberalizing liberalize%2:41:00::
the
practice
of
prohibiting prohibit%2:32:00::
dogs
in
apartments
.
Use use%2:34:01::
the
terraces
of
the
Capitol
for
a
sidewalk
cafe
?
Could
Senator_Humphrey
be be%2:42:03::
serious
in
his
proposal
?
Is be%2:42:03::
nothing
in_this
country
more
sacred
than
the
tourists
'
comfort
?
Perhaps
the
idea
of
sidewalk
cafes
could
be
extended extend%2:40:05::
.
The
Lincoln
and
Jefferson_Memorials
are be%2:42:03::
rather
bleak
.
Why
not
put put%2:35:00::
a
cafe
in
each
so
the
tourists
would
not
have have%2:42:05::
to
travel travel%2:38:00::
too
far
to
eat eat%2:34:00::
?
Unfortunately
the
cafes
might
not
make make%2:40:01::
enough
money
to
support support%2:40:00::
themselves
during
the
off
season
.
As
an
added
suggestion
to
balance balance%2:42:00::
the
budget
,
the
Government
could
sell sell%2:40:00::
advertising
space
on
the
Washington_Monument
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
visible
throughout
the
city
,
and
men
from
Madison_ave.
would
jump jump%2:38:00::
at
the
chance
.
Sen._Hubert_Humphrey
is be%2:42:06::
obviously
a
man
with
a
soul
and
heart
.
He
,
like
most_of
us
,
wants want%2:37:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
able
to
sit sit%2:35:00::
,
to
contemplate contemplate%2:31:01::
and
be
moved move%2:37:00::
by
the
great
outdoors
.
Let let%2:41:00::
us
have have%2:40:00::
more
benches
and
fewer
forbidden
areas
around
fountains
and
gardens
.
Let let%2:41:00::
us
,
like
the_French
,
have have%2:40:00::
outdoor
cafes
where
we
may
relax relax%2:29:00::
,
converse converse%2:32:00::
at_leisure
and
enjoy enjoy%2:34:00::
the
passing
crowd
.
Two
strong
dissents
from
the

of
the

)
by
Senators
Proxmire
and
Butler
allege allege%2:32:00::
that
the
New_Deal
fiscal
policy
of
the
Thirties
did
not
