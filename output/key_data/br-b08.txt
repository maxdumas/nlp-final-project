thing
I

;
a

will
never
have have%2:40:00::
spiritual
poise

inner
peace
as
long
as
the
heart
holds hold%2:40:02::
a

I
know know%2:31:00::
a
man
who
held hold%2:40:02::
resentment
against
a
neighbor
for
more_than
three
decades
.
Several
years
ago
I
was be%2:42:06::
his
pastor
.
One
night
,
at
the
close
of
the
evening
service
,
he
came_forward come_forward%2:38:00::
,
left leave%2:42:02::
his
resentment
at
the
altar
and
gave give%2:40:00::
his
heart
to
God
.
After
almost
everyone
had
gone go%2:38:01::
he
told tell%2:32:01::
me
the
simple
story
of
how
one
of
his
neighbors
had
moved move%2:38:01::
a
fence
a_few
feet
over
on
his
land
.
``
We
tried try%2:41:00::
to

he

could
never

I
settled settle%2:32:02::

he
continued continue%2:42:01::
.
``
I

Forgiveness
is be%2:42:06::
the
door
through
which
a
person
must
pass pass%2:38:05::
to
enter enter%2:38:00::
the

the

Henry_van_Dyke

Forgive forgive%2:32:00::
and
forget forget%2:31:01::
if
you
can
;
but
forgive forgive%2:32:00::
anyway
''
.
Jesus
made make%2:30:00::
three
things
clear
about
forgiveness
.
We
must
,
first_of_all
,
be be%2:42:03::
willing
to
forgive forgive%2:32:00::
others
before
we
can
secure secure%2:40:00::
God
's
forgiveness
.
``
For
if
ye
forgive forgive%2:32:00::
men
their
trespasses
,
your
heavenly
Father
will
also
forgive forgive%2:32:00::
you
:
but
if
ye
forgive forgive%2:32:00::
not
men
their
trespasses

neither
will
your
Father
forgive forgive%2:32:00::
your
trespasses

.
Matthew
6
:
14
-
15
.
It
will
do do%2:36:02::
no
good
to
seek seek%2:35:00::
God
's
forgiveness
until
we
have
forgiven forgive%2:32:00::
those
who
have
done do%2:36:02::
us
wrong
.
Then
,
Jesus
indicated indicate%2:32:00::
that
God
's
forgiveness
is be%2:42:03::
unlimited
.
In
the
prayer
Jesus
taught teach%2:32:00::
his
disciples
to
pray pray%2:32:00::
we
find find%2:40:02::
these
words
,
``
Forgive forgive%2:32:00::
us
our
debts
''
.
When
a
person
meets meet%2:42:01::
God
's
requirements
for
the
experience
of
forgiveness
he
is be%2:42:03::
forgiven
.
God
's
mercy
and
patience
will
last last%2:42:00::
forever
.
Forgiveness
implies imply%2:32:01::
more_than
a
person
wanting want%2:37:00::
his
past
sins
covered cover%2:42:00::
by
God
's
love
.
It
also
implies imply%2:32:01::
that
a
man
wants want%2:37:00::
his
future
to
be be%2:42:03::
free
from
the
mistakes
of
the
past
.
We
want want%2:37:00::
the
past
forgiven forgive%2:32:00::
,
but
at_the_same_time
we
must
be be%2:42:03::
willing
for
God
to
direct direct%2:41:00::
the
future
.
Finally
,
we
must
be be%2:42:03::
willing
to
forgive forgive%2:32:00::
others
as_many
times
as
they
sin sin%2:41:00::
against
us
.
Once
Peter
asked ask%2:32:00::
,
``
How
oft
shall
my
brother
sin sin%2:41:00::
against
me
,
and
I
forgive forgive%2:32:00::
him
?
Till
seven
times
?
Jesus
saith
unto
him
,
until
seventy
times
seven
''
.
Matthew
18
:
21
-
22
.
Jesus
not_only
taught teach%2:32:00::
forgiveness
,
He
gave give%2:40:03::
us
an
example
of_it
on
the
cross
.
With
all
the
energy
of
his
broken
body
he
prayed pray%2:32:00::
,
``
Father
,
forgive forgive%2:32:00::
them

for

know know%2:31:01::

pulpit
is be%2:42:03::
a
lonely
place
.
Who
stops stop%2:42:00::
to
think_of think_of%2:31:03::
that
?
Imagine imagine%2:36:00::
the
searching
and
the
prayer
that
lay lie%2:42:00::
behind
the
letter
the
rector
wrote write%2:36:00::
after
almost
a
decade
of
service
to
this
majestic
church
.
``
Such
a
church
needs need%2:42:00::
vigor
and
vitality
in
its
rector
and
one
man
has have%2:40:00::
only
so_much
of
these
endowments
''
,
he
told tell%2:32:04::
his
members
.
A
minister
should
not
stay stay%2:42:02::
``
beyond
the
time
that
his
leadership
should
benefit benefit%2:40:01::
''
his
church
,
he
wrote write%2:36:00::
,
``
for
he
becomes become%2:42:01::
ordinary
''
.
And
so
the
young
minister
resigned resign%2:41:00::
,
to
go go%2:41:00::
and
study study%2:31:01::
and
pray pray%2:32:00::
,
having
never
passed pass%2:42:00::
a
day
,
he
told tell%2:32:04::
his
parishioners
,
when
``
I
did
not
gain gain%2:40:02::
from
you
far
more_than
I
ever
gave give%2:40:03::
to
you
''
.
His
very
honest
act
called_up call_up%2:32:03::
the
recent
talk
I
had have%2:39:06::
with
another
minister
,
a
modest
Methodist
,
who
said say%2:32:00::
:
``
I
feel feel%2:37:00::
so
deeply
blessed
by
God
when
I
can
give give%2:40:07::
a
message
of
love
and
comfort
to
other
men
,
and
I
would
have
it
no
other
way
:
and
it
is be%2:42:03::
unworthy
to
think_of think_of%2:31:02::
self
.
But
oh
,
how
I
do
sometimes
need need%2:37:00::
just
a
moment
of
rest
,
and
peace
,
in
myself
''
.
A
man
who
gives give%2:40:00::
himself
to
God
and
to
the
believers
of
his
church
takes take%2:40:05::
upon
himself
a
life
of
giving
.
He
does
not
expect expect%2:31:00::
to
get get%2:40:00::
great
riches
or
he
would
not
have
chosen choose%2:31:01::
to
answer answer%2:31:02::
the
call
to
preach preach%2:32:02::
.
The
good
ones
are be%2:42:03::
not
motivated
to
seek seek%2:35:00::
vainly
,
nor
are be%2:42:03::
they
disposed
to
covet covet%2:37:00::
comfort
,
or
they
would
have
been
led lead%2:38:01::
to
fields
that
offer offer%2:40:02::
comfort
and
feed feed%2:41:00::
vanity
.
Theirs
is be%2:42:03::
a
sacrificial
life
by
earthly
standards
.
Yet
we
who
lean lean%2:31:10::
upon
such
a
man
and
draw draw%2:40:00::
strength
from
him
and
expect expect%2:32:00::
interpretation
of
the
infinite
through
him
-
we
who
readily
accept accept%2:40:00::
his
sacrifice
as
our
due
,
we
of
the
congregations
are be%2:42:03::
the
first
to
tell tell%2:32:04::
him
what
is be%2:42:05::
in
our
minds
instead
of
listening listen%2:39:00::
to
what
is be%2:42:05::
in
his
soul
.
We
press press%2:32:00::
him
to
conform_to conform_to%2:42:01::
our
comfortable
conceptions
and
not
to
bruise bruise%2:35:00::
our
satisfactions
with
his
word
,
and
God
's
.
We
do
not
defeat defeat%2:33:00::
the
good
ones
with
this
cruelty
,
but
we
add add%2:40:00::
to
their
burden
,
while
expecting expect%2:32:00::
them
to
bestow bestow%2:40:00::
saintliness
upon
us
in_return
for
ostentatious
church
attendance
and
a_few
bucks
a
week
,
American
cash
.
If
we
break break%2:30:11::
the
minister
to
our
bit
,
we
are
buying buy%2:40:00::
back
our
own
sins
.
If
he
won
n't
break break%2:30:11::
,
we
add add%2:40:00::
to
the
stress
he
bears bear%2:31:00::
.
And
a
minister
of
all
men
is be%2:42:03::
most
conscious
that
he
is be%2:42:03::
mere
man
-
prone
to
the
stresses
that
earthly
humanity
is be%2:42:06::
heir
to
.
We
expect expect%2:32:00::
him
to
be be%2:42:03::
noble
,
and
to
make make%2:30:00::
us
so
-
yet
he
knows know%2:31:02::
,
and
tries try%2:41:00::
to
tell tell%2:32:04::
us
,
how
very
humble
man
must
be be%2:42:03::
.
We
expect expect%2:32:00::
bestowal
of
God
's
love
through
him
.
But
how
little
love
we
give give%2:40:03::
him
.
The
church
truly
is be%2:42:06::
not
a
rest_home
for
saints
,
but
a
hospital
for
sinners
.
Yet
every
Sunday
we
sinners
go_to go_to%2:42:00::
that
emergency_room
to
receive receive%2:30:01::
first_aid
,
and
we
leave leave%2:38:01::
unmindful
that
the
man
who
ministered minister%2:41:12::
to
us
is be%2:42:06::
a
human_being
who
suffers suffer%2:37:00::
,
too
.
