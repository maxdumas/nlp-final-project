I
have
just
asked ask%2:32:00::
these
questions
in
the
Pentagon

in
the

,
in
offices
of
key

which
are be%2:42:03::
affectionately
known

I
asked ask%2:32:00::
the
same
questions
inside
the
launch-control
rooms
of
an
Atlas
missile
base
in
Wyoming
,
where
officers

the

a

accidentally

in

other
pistol-packing

could
give give%2:32:01::
orders
to

such

To
the
men
in
the
instrument-jammed

the
antiseptic

windowless

that
would
be be%2:42:02::
the

of

the

There
is be%2:42:00::

but
its

are be%2:42:03::
immediate

``
Readiness

are be%2:42:03::
almost
continuous
.
Each
could
be be%2:42:02::
the

In

special

the

a

would
unleash unleash%2:35:01::
an
American

There
is be%2:42:00::
little
time
for
the
men
in
the
command
centers
to
reflect reflect%2:31:00::
about
the

They

Accidental

is be%2:42:03::
so

that
most_of

just

the

,
the
answers
to
my

varied vary%2:30:01::
partly
according
to_a_man
's
flair
for
what
the
professionals
in_this
field
call call%2:32:02::
``

As
an
Air_Force

put put%2:32:00::
it
:
``
You
can
n't
have have%2:36:00::

The

are
thus
forced force%2:41:00::
to

sequences
of
events
that
have
never
occurred occur%2:30:00::
,
probably
never

but
possibly
might

Only
one
rule
prevailed prevail%2:42:00::
in
my
conversations
with
these
men
:
The
more
highly
placed
they
are be%2:42:03::

that_is
,
the
more
they
know know%2:31:01::
-
the
more
concerned
they
have

.
Already
accidental
war
is be%2:42:06::
a
silent
guest
at
the
discussions
within
the
Kennedy_Administration
about
the
urgency
of
disarmament
and
nearly
all
other
questions
of
national
security
.
Only
recently
new
``
holes
''
were
discovered discover%2:39:03::
in
our
safety
measures
,
and
a
search
is be%2:42:03::
now
on
for
more
.
Work
is be%2:42:03::
under_way
to
see see%2:31:02::
whether
new
restraining
devices
should
be_installed
on
all
nuclear_weapons
.
Meanwhile
,
the
experts
speak speak%2:32:01::
of
wars
triggered trigger%2:36:00::
by
``
false

,
``

a

Their

were
,
almost

accompanied accompany%2:42:00::
by
the

arms

One

the

Yet
implicit_in

was be%2:42:03::
the
death
of
millions
,
perhaps
hundreds
of
millions
,
perhaps
you
and
me
-
and
the
experts

These
men
are be%2:42:03::
not
callous

It
is be%2:42:06::
their
job
to
think_about think_about%2:31:03::
the

Unanimously
they

that
the

a

more

and

too

thought_about think_about%2:31:03::
accidental

The
first
systematic
thinking
about
this
Pandora
's
box
within
Pandora
's
boxes
was
done do%2:41:01::
four
years
ago
by
Fred_Ikle
,
a
frail
,
meek-mannered
Swiss-born
sociologist
.
He
was be%2:41:00::
,
and
is be%2:41:00::
,
with
the
RAND_Corporation
,
a
nonprofit
pool
of

financed finance%2:40:00::
by

His

made make%2:30:00::
him
the
Paul_Revere

,
and
safety
procedures
were
enormously
increased increase%2:30:00::
.
In
recent
weeks
,
as
a
result
of
a
sweeping
defense_policy
reappraisal
by
the
Kennedy_Administration
,
basic
United_States
strategy
has
been
modified modify%2:30:00::
-
and
large
new
sums
allocated allocate%2:40:00::

to
meet meet%2:41:02::
the
accidental-war
danger
and
to
reduce reduce%2:30:00::
it
as
quickly
as
possible
.
The
chain
starts start%2:42:00::
at
BMEWS
(

in

Its

For

.
Multiple
circuits
,
routings
and
frequencies
make make%2:30:00::
the
chain
as
unbreakable
as
possible
.
The
same
principle
of
``
redundancy
''
applies apply%2:42:00::
to
all
communications
on
these
special
networks
.
And
no

can
be

on

senders

in_advance

by
special

,
that
the
messages
actually
come come%2:42:04::
from

Additional

can
be

to

Only

permitted permit%2:32:00::
to

That
's
the
law

But
what
if
somebody
decides decide%2:31:00::
to
break break%2:41:00::
it
?
The
President
cannot
personally
remove remove%2:30:00::
the
safety
devices
from
every
nuclear
trigger
.
He
makes make%2:41:00::
the
momentous
decision
.
Hundreds
of
men
are
required require%2:42:00::
to
pass pass%2:32:01::
the
word
to
the
button
pushers
and
to
push push%2:38:00::
the

.
What
if
one
or
more
of
them
turn turn%2:30:03::
irrational
or
suddenly
,
coolly
,
decide decide%2:31:00::
to
clobber clobber%2:35:01::
the
Russians
?
What
if
the
President
himself
,
in
the
language
of
the
military
,
``
goes_ape
''
?
Or
singlehandedly
decided decide%2:31:00::
to
reverse reverse%2:31:00::
national
policy
and
hit hit%2:33:00::
the
Soviets
without
provocation
?
Nobody
can
be be%2:42:03::
absolutely
certain
of
the
answers
.
However
,
the
system
is
designed design%2:31:00::
,
ingeniously
and
hopefully
,
so_that
no
one
man
could
initiate initiate%2:36:01::
a
thermonuclear

.
Even
the
President
cannot
pick_up pick_up%2:35:01::
his
telephone
and
give give%2:32:01::
a
``
go

order
.
Even
he
does
not
know know%2:31:01::
the
one
signal
for
a
nuclear
strike
-
the
``
go

''
.
In
an
emergency
he
would
receive receive%2:39:00::
available
intelligence
on
the
``

''
.
A
system
of

,
the

other

All
can
be_connected
with
the
gold

from
their

.
All
could
help help%2:41:00::
the
President
make
his

.
The
talk
would
not
be be%2:42:03::
in
code

but
neither
would
it
ramble ramble%2:42:00::
.
Vital
questions
would
be

answered answer%2:31:00::
according
to
a

Officers
who
participate participate%2:41:00::
in

me
that
the
President
's
decision

be
made

announced announce%2:32:02::
on
the
gold
circuit
within
minutes
after
the
first
flash

BMEWS

If
communications
work work%2:41:03::
,
his

would
be

in_all

that
would

For

They

Let

before

could

In
a
word
,
plenty
.
The
key
man
almost
certainly
would
be be%2:42:06::
Col._William_W._Wisman
,
SAC

He

And
Bill_Wisman

a

is be%2:42:03::

His

steady

His

No

At_least

never

In_front

a

In
emergencies
the
SAC
commander

Gen._Thomas_Power

a

Wisman

At
General_Power

seat
in
the
balcony
there
is be%2:42:05::
also
a

General_Power
would
participate participate%2:41:00::
in

Wisman

would

His

He

)
But
Wisman
,
too
,
does
not
know know%2:31:01::
the
go

.
He
must
take take%2:30:00::
it

``

In_point_of_fact
,
this
is be%2:42:06::
a

about

a

square
and
hung hang%2:35:03::
from

wall
about
six
feet
from
the

to
Wisman

The

Now

vague

for
we
are
approaching approach%2:38:00::
one

The

But
even
the
contents
of
Wisman

cannot
start start%2:30:01::
a

They
are be%2:42:03::

In_addition

I
asked ask%2:32:00::
Wisman
what
would
happen happen%2:30:00::
if
he
broke_out break_out%2:35:00::
the
go
codes
and
tried try%2:41:00::
to
start start%2:30:00::
transmitting transmit%2:32:00::
one
.
``
I
'd
wind_up wind_up%2:30:01::
full_of
.38
bullet_holes
''
,
he
said say%2:32:00::
,
and
there
was be%2:42:00::
no
question
that
he
was
talking_about talk_about%2:32:00::
bullets
fired fire%2:33:00::
by
his
coworkers
.
Now
let
us
imagine imagine%2:36:00::
a
wing
of
B-52
's
,
on
alert
near
their
``
positive
control
(
or
fail-safe
)

''
,
the
spots
on
the
map
,
many
miles
from
Soviet
territory
,
beyond
which
they
are
forbidden forbid%2:32:00::
to
fly fly%2:38:00::
without
specific
orders
to
proceed proceed%2:38:00::
to
their
targets
.
They
,
too
,
have have%2:40:00::
fragments
of
the
go
code
with
them
.
As
Wisman
put put%2:32:00::
it
,
``
They
have have%2:40:00::
separate
pieces
of
the
pie
,
and
we
have have%2:40:00::
the
whole

.
Once
we
send_out send_out%2:35:00::
the

,
they
can
put put%2:35:00::
their

into
it

Unless
we
send_out send_out%2:35:00::
the

,
their

mean mean%2:42:03::
nothing
''
.
Why
does
Wisman
's
ever-changing
code
always
mesh mesh%2:30:00::
with
the
fragments
in
possession
of
the
button

?
The
answer
is be%2:42:06::
a
cryptographic
secret
.
At_any_rate
,
three
men
out
of
a
six-man
B-52
crew
are
required require%2:42:00::
to
copy copy%2:36:05::
down
Wisman
's
go-to-war
message
.
Each
must
match match%2:35:08::
Wisman
's
``
pie
''
with
the
fragment
that
he
carries carry%2:42:01::
with
him
.
All
three
must
compare compare%2:31:00::
notes
and
agree agree%2:32:00::
to
``
go go%2:38:09::

.
After_that
,
it
requires require%2:42:00::
several
minutes

including include%2:42:00::
six

each

Unless
