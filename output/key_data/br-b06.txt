St._Louis
sits sit%2:42:00::
in_the_center
of

stagnant
mid-continent
region

Slackened
regional
demand

goods

reflects reflect%2:39:01::
the

relative
lack

Not

St._Louis
industries

of_course
,
have have%2:42:00::

But
for

which
do

the

has have%2:40:04::

That

would

to

He
says say%2:32:03::
the

The

a

economic

such
a
study

In
Southern_Illinois
,
the
new
federal
program
of
help
to
economically
depressed
areas
ought
to
provide provide%2:40:00::
some
stimulus

labor_market
,
where
unemployment
has
been be%2:42:03::
substantially
higher

The
Federal

eventually

and
in_the_long_run
that
will

St._Louis

Politics-ridden
St._Clair
county
in
Illinois
presents present%2:42:00::
another
piece
of
the
problem
of
metropolitan
development
.
More
industrial
acreage
lies lie%2:42:00::
vacant
in
St._Clair
county
than
in
any
other
jurisdiction
in
the
St._Louis
area

political
situation
there
represents represent%2:42:01::
one
reason
new
plants
shy_away_from shy_away_from%2:32:00::
the
East_Side
.
And_then
there
is
St._Louis
county
,
where
the
Democratic
leadership
has
shown show%2:39:04::
little
appreciation
of
the
need
for
sound
zoning
,
of
the
important
relationship
between
proper
land
use
and
economic
growth
.
St._Louis
county
under
its
present
leadership
also
has
largely
closed close%2:35:00::
its
eyes
to
the
need
for
governmental
reform
,
and
permitted permit%2:32:00::
parochial
interests

Some
plant-location
specialists
take take%2:31:07::
these
signs

St._Louis
county
does

so
they
avoid avoid%2:32:00::
the
area

and
more

.
Metropolitan
St._Louis
's
relatively
slow
rate_of_growth
ought
to
be be%2:42:03::
a
priority
concern
of
the
political
,
business
,
civic
and
other
leaders
on
both
sides
of
the
Mississippi
.
Without
a
great
acceleration
in
the
metropolitan
area
's
economy
,
there
will
not
be
sufficient
jobs
for
the
growing
numbers
of

and
St._Louis
will
slip slip%2:30:00::
into

Many_of

very
best

are be%2:42:03::
reformers

Still
we
must
confess confess%2:32:00::
that
sometimes
some
of
them
go go%2:41:00::
too
far
.
Take take%2:31:03::

for_example
,
the
reformers

Having

Even_though

do
they
believe believe%2:31:00::
that
they
can

Granted
that
the
Tammany
name
and
the
Tammany
tiger
often
were
regarded_as regard_as%2:31:00::
badges
of
political
shame
,
the
sachems
of
the
Hall
also
have have%2:40:00::
a_few

But
it
is be%2:42:06::
tradition

the
record

balks balk%2:41:00::
at
the
expunging
of

After_all
,
it
goes_back go_back%2:42:00::
to
the
days
in_which
sedition
was be%2:42:03::
not
un-American
,
the
days
in_which
the
Sons
of
St._Tammany

to
overthrow overthrow%2:41:00::
the

Further

do

that
the
cartoonists

to

They

Instead

official

Col._Mariano_Faget
,
from
his
preposterous
position
as
interrogator
of
Cuban
refugees
for
the
Immigration_Service
.
The
Faget
appointment
was be%2:42:03::
preposterous
on
several
grounds
.
The
Kennedy_Administration
had
assured assure%2:32:02::
anti-Castro
Cubans
that
it
would
have have%2:42:12::
nothing
to
do do%2:42:00::
with
associates
of
Dictator_Batista
.
Using use%2:34:01::
a
Batista
man
to
screen screen%2:31:00::
refugees
represented represent%2:32:02::
a
total
misunderstanding
of
the
democratic
forces
which
alone
can
effectively
oppose oppose%2:32:01::
Castro
.
Moreover
,
Col._Faget
's
information
on
Cuba
was be%2:42:03::
too
outdated
to
be be%2:42:03::
useful
in
``
screening

Castro
agents
;
the
Colonel

the
friendly
haven
of
the
Dominican
dictatorship
as

as
Castro
seized seize%2:40:01::
power
.
And
while
he
had
headed head%2:41:00::
Batista
's
anti-Communist
section
,
the
Batista
regime
did
not
disturb disturb%2:37:00::
the
Communists
so_much
as
more
open
opponents
who
were
alleged allege%2:32:00::
to

Responsibility

appointment
rests rest%2:35:00::
with
Gen._J._M.
swing

an
Eisenhower
appointee
as
head
of

Gen._Swing
has
received receive%2:30:01::
public
attention
before_this
for
abuse
of
some
of
the
prerogatives
of
his

His

expired expire%2:42:00::

Some
reports
say say%2:32:01::
he
was
rescued rescue%2:41:00::
from
timely
retirement
by
his
friend
,
Congressman_Walter

for
all
the

it
could
get get%2:40:00::
.
Congressman_Walter
has
been be%2:42:03::
all-powerful
in
immigration
matters
,
but
he
has
announced announce%2:32:00::
plans
to
retire retire%2:41:01::
in
1962
.
At
that
point
the
Administration
will
have have%2:40:00::
little
reason

hang_on hang_on%2:30:00::
to
Gen._Swing

The
Faget

This

Nowhere

speaker

the
serious
purpose

the

His
words
were be%2:42:03::

Finally

Mr._Eisenhower

This

recalls recall%2:42:00::

This

Mr._Eisenhower
