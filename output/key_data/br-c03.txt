Francois
D
'
Albert
,
Hungarian-born
violinist
who
made
his
New_York
debut
three
years
ago
,
played play%2:36:03::
a
return
engagement
last
night
in
Judson_Hall
.
He
is be%2:42:06::
now
president
of
the
Chicago_Conservatory_College
.
His
pianist
was be%2:42:06::
Donald_Jenni
,
a
faculty_member
at
DePaul_University
.
The
acoustics
of
the
small
hall
had
been
misgauged misgauge%2:31:00::
by
the
artists
,
so_that
for
the
first_half
of
the
program
,
when
the
piano
was be%2:42:03::
partially
open
,
Mr._Jenni
's
playing
was be%2:42:03::
too
loud
.
In
vying vie%2:33:00::
with
him
,
Mr.
D
'
Albert
also
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
be
overdriving overdrive%2:41:00::
his
tone
.
This
was be%2:42:03::
not
an
overriding
drawback
to
enjoyment
of
the
performances
,
however
,
except
in
the
case
of
the
opening
work
,
Mozart
's
Sonata
in
A
(
K.
526
)
,
which
clattered clatter%2:39:00::
along
noisily
in
an
unrelieved
fashion
.
Brahm
's
Sonata
in
A
,
although
also
vigorous
,
stood_up stand_up%2:33:00::
well
under
the
two
artists
'
strong
,
large-scale
treatment
.
Mr.
D
'
Albert
has have%2:40:00::
a
firm
,
attractive
tone
,
which
eschews eschew%2:32:00::
an
overly
sweet
vibrato
.
He
made make%2:38:00::
the
most
of
the
long
Brahmsian
phrases
,
and
by
the
directness
and
drive
of
his
playing
gave give%2:40:03::
the
work
a
handsome
performance
.
A
Sonata
for
Violin
and
Piano
,
called
``
Bella_Bella
''
,
by
Robert_Fleming
,
was
given give%2:40:03::
its
first
United_States
performance
.
The
title
refers refer%2:32:01::
to
the
nickname
given give%2:40:03::
his
wife
by
the
composer
,
who
is be%2:42:06::
also
a
member
of
the
National_Film_Board
of
Canada
.
The
work
's
two
movements
,
one
melodically
sentimental
,
the
other
brightly
capricious
,
are be%2:42:03::
clever
enough
in
a
Ravel-like
style
,
but
they
rehash rehash%2:34:00::
a
wornout
idiom
.
They
might
well
indicate indicate%2:32:01::
conjugal
felicity
,
but
in
musical
terms
that
smack smack%2:39:13::
of
Hollywood
.
Works
by
Dohnanyi
,
Hubay
,
Mr.
D
'
Albert
himself
and
Paganini
,
indicated indicate%2:32:01::
that
the
violinist
had have%2:40:00::
some
virtuoso
fireworks
up
his
sleeve
as_well
as
a
reserved
attitude
toward
a
lyric
phrase
.
Standard
items
by
Sarasate
and
Saint-Saens
completed complete%2:30:02::
the
program
.
In
recent
years
Anna_Xydis
has
played play%2:36:12::
with
the
New_York
Philharmonic
and
at
Lewisohn_Stadium
,
but
her
program
last
night
at
Town_Hall
was be%2:42:03::
the
Greek-born
pianist
's
first
New_York
recital
since
1948
.
Miss_Xydis
has have%2:40:00::
a
natural
affinity
for
the
keyboard
,
and
in
the
twenty
years
since
her
debut
here
she
has
gained gain%2:40:01::
the
authority
and
inner
assurance
that
lead lead%2:42:12::
to
audience
control
.
And
the
tone
she
commands command%2:41:00::
is be%2:42:03::
always
beautiful
in
sound
.
Since
she
also
has have%2:40:00::
considerable
technical
virtuosity
and
a
feeling
for
music
in
the
romantic
tradition
,
Miss_Xydis
gave give%2:40:05::
her
listeners
a
good_deal
of
pleasure
.
She
played play%2:36:12::
with
style
and
a
touch
of
the
grand
manner
,
and
every
piece
she
performed perform%2:36:01::
was be%2:42:03::
especially
effective
in
its
closing
measures
.
The
second_half
of
her
program
was be%2:42:03::
devoted_to
Russian
composers
of_this
century
.
It
was be%2:42:04::
in
them
that
Miss_Xydis
was be%2:42:03::
at
her
best
.
The
Rachmaninoff_Prelude
No
.12
,
Op.
32
,
for_instance
,
gave give%2:40:05::
her
an
opportunity
to
exploit exploit%2:34:01::
one
of
her
special
facilities
-
the
ability
to
produce produce%2:36:02::
fine
deep-sounding
bass
tones
while
contrasting contrast%2:42:00::
them
simultaneously
with
fine
silver
filagree
in
the
treble
.
The
four
Kabalevsky
Preludes
were be%2:42:03::
also
assured
,
rich_in
color
and
songful
.
And
the
Prokofieff_Seventh_Sonata
had have%2:42:00::
the
combination
of
romanticism
and
modern
bravura
that
Prokofieff
needs need%2:42:00::
.
Miss_Xydis
'
earlier
selections
were be%2:42:03::
Mendelssohn
's
Variations
Serieuses
,
in_which
each
variation
was be%2:42:03::
nicely
set_off
from
the
others
;
Haydn
's
Sonata
in
E
minor
,
which
was be%2:42:03::
unfailingly
pleasant
in
sound
,
and
Chopin
's
Sonata
in
B
flat
minor
.
A
memory
lapse
in
the
last
somewhat
marred mar%2:30:00::
the
pianist
's
performance
.
So
what
was be%2:42:06::
the
deepest
music
on
her
program
had have%2:40:00::
the
poorest
showing
.
Miss_Xydis
was be%2:42:03::
best
when
she
did
not
need need%2:42:01::
to
be be%2:42:03::
too
probing
.
All
the
generals
who
held hold%2:40:02::
important
commands
in
World_War
2
,
did
not
write write%2:36:02::
books
.
It
only
seems seem%2:39:00::
as
if
they
did
.
And
the
best
books
by
generals
were be%2:42:06::
not
necessarily
the
first
ones
written write%2:36:02::
.
One
of
the
very
best
is
only
now
published publish%2:36:01::
in_this
country
,
five
years
after
its
first
publication
in
England
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
``
Defeat
Into
Victory
''
,
by
Field_Marshal
Viscount_Slim
.
A
long
book
heavily
weighted
with
military
technicalities
,
in_this
edition
it
is be%2:42:03::
neither
so_long
nor
so
technical
as
it
was be%2:42:03::
originally
.
Field_Marshal
Slim
has
abridged abridge%2:30:00::
it
for
the
benefit
of
``
those
who
,
finding find%2:31:10::
not
so
great
an
attraction
in
accounts
of
military
moves
and
counter-moves
,
are be%2:42:03::
more
interested
in
men
and
their
reactions
to
stress
,
hardship
and
danger
''
.
The
man
whose
reactions
and
conclusions
get get%2:40:00::
the_most
space
is be%2:42:06::
,
of_course
,
the
Field_Marshal
himself
.
William_Joseph_Slim
,
First_Viscount_Slim
,
former
Governor_General
of
Australia
,
was be%2:41:00::
the
principal
British
commander
in
the
field
during
the
Burma_War
.
He
had
been be%2:41:00::
a
corps
commander
during
the
disastrous
defeat
and
retreat
of
1942
when
the
ill-prepared
,
ill-equipped
British
forces
``
were
outmaneuvered outmaneuver%2:33:00::
,
outfought outfight%2:33:00::
and
outgeneraled outgeneral%2:33:00::
''
.
He
returned return%2:38:00::
in
command
of
an
international
army
of
Gurkhas
,
Indians
,
Africans
,
Chinese
and
British
.
And
in_a_series
of
bitterly
fought
battles
in
the
jungles
and
hills
and
along
the
great
rivers
of
Burma
he
waged wage%2:41:00::
one
of
the_most
brilliant
campaigns
of
the
war
.
``
The
Forgotten_War
''
his
soldiers
called call%2:32:02::
the
Burma
fighting
because
the
war
in
Africa
and
Europe
enjoyed enjoy%2:34:01::
priorities
in
equipment
and
in
headlines
.
Parts
of
``
Defeat
Into
Victory
''
are be%2:42:03::
a
tangle
of
Burmese
place_names
and
military_units
,
but
a_little
application
makes make%2:30:00::
everything
clear
enough
.
On_the_whole
this
is be%2:42:03::
an
interesting
and
exceptionally
well-written
book
.
Field_Marshal
Slim
is be%2:42:03::
striking
in
description
,
amusing
in
many
anecdotes
.
He
has have%2:40:00::
a
pleasant
sense_of_humor
and
is be%2:42:03::
modest
enough
to
admit admit%2:32:00::
mistakes
and
even
``
a
cardinal
error
''
.
He
praises praise%2:32:00::
many
individuals
generously
.
He
himself
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
tough
,
tireless
,
able
and
intelligent
,
more
intellectual
and
self-critical
than
most
soldiers
.
``
Defeat
Into
Victory
''
is be%2:42:03::
a
dramatic
and
lively
military
narrative
.
But
it
is be%2:42:03::
most
interesting
in
its
account
of
the
unending
problems
of
high_command
,
of
decisions
and
their
reasons
,
of
the
myriad
matters
that
demand demand%2:42:00::
attention
in_addition
to
battle
action
.
Before
he
could
return return%2:38:00::
to
Burma
,
Field_Marshal
Slim
had have%2:42:05::
to
rally rally%2:33:00::
the
defeated
remnants
of
a
discouraged
army
and
unite unite%2:41:00::
them
with
fresh
recruits
.
His
remarks
about
training
,
discipline
,
morale
,
leadership
and
command
are be%2:42:03::
enlightening
.
He
believed_in believe_in%2:31:01::
making make%2:41:00::
inspiring
speeches
and
he
made make%2:41:00::
a
great
many
.
He
believed_in believe_in%2:31:01::
being
seen see%2:39:00::
near
the
front_lines
and
he
was be%2:42:05::
there
.
For
general
morale
reasons
and
to
encourage encourage%2:37:00::
the
efforts
of
his
supply_officers
,
when
food
was be%2:42:03::
short
for
combat
troops
he
cut cut%2:30:06::
the
rations
of
his
headquarters_staff
accordingly
.
Other
crucial
matters
required require%2:42:00::
constant
supervision
:
labor
and
all
noncombatant
troops
,
whose
morale
was be%2:42:03::
vital
,
too
;
administrative
organization
and
delicate
diplomatic
relations
with
Top
Brass
-
British
,
American
and
Chinese
;
health
,
hygiene
,
medical_aid
and
preventive_medicine
;
hospitals
(
inadequate
)
and
nurses
(
scanty
)
;
food
and
military
supplies
;
logistics
and
transport
;
airdrops
and
airstrips
;
roads
and
river
barges
to
be
built build%2:36:00::
.
Commenting comment%2:32:00::
on
these
and
other
matters
,
Field_Marshal
Slim
makes make%2:41:00::
many
frank
and
provocative
remarks
:
``
When
in
doubt
as
to
two
courses
of
action
,
a
general
should
choose choose%2:31:00::
the
bolder
''
.
``
The
commander
has
failed fail%2:41:00::
in
his
duty
if
he
has
not
won win%2:33:00::
victory
-
for
that
is be%2:42:06::
his
duty
''
.
``
It
only
does
harm
to
talk talk%2:32:01::
to
troops
about
new
and
desirable
equipment
which
others
may
have have%2:40:00::
but
which
you
cannot
give give%2:40:00::
them
.
It
depresses depress%2:37:00::
them
.
So
I
made
no
mention
of
air
transport
until
we
could
get get%2:40:00::
at
least
some
of_it
''
.
Field_Marshal
Slim
is be%2:42:03::
more
impressed
by
the
courage
of
Japanese
soldiers
than
he
is be%2:42:03::
by
the
ability
of
their
commanders
.
Of
the
Japanese
private
he
says say%2:32:00::
:
``
He
fought fight%2:33:00::
and
marched march%2:38:01::
till
he
died die%2:30:00::
.
If
500
Japanese
were
ordered order%2:32:01::
to
hold hold%2:40:02::
a
position
,
we
had have%2:42:05::
to
kill kill%2:35:00::
495
before
it
was be%2:42:03::
ours
-
and_then
the
last
five
killed kill%2:35:00::
themselves
''
.
Brooding brood%2:31:00::
about
future
wars
,
the
Field_Marshal
has have%2:40:00::
this
to
say say%2:32:00::
:
``
The
Asian
fighting
man
is be%2:42:03::
at_least
equally
brave

,
less
encumbered
by
mental
doubts

less
troubled

and
not

moved
by
slaughter

mutilation

He

by

bunch
of
young
buckaroos
from
out
West
,
who
go_by go_by%2:32:00::
the
name
of
Texas
Boys
Choir
,
loped lope%2:38:00::
into
Town_Hall
last
night
and
succeeded succeed%2:41:00::
in
corralling corral%2:35:00::
the
hearts
of
a
sizable
audience
.
Actually
,
the
program
they
sang sing%2:36:01::
was be%2:42:03::
at_least
two-thirds
serious
and
high-minded
,
and
they
sang sing%2:36:01::
it
beautifully
.
Under
the
capable
direction
of
the
choir
's
founder
,
Geroge_Bragg
,
the
twenty-six
boys
made make%2:41:00::
some
lovely
sounds
in
an
opening
group
of
Renaissance
and
baroque
madrigals
and
motets
,
excerpts
from
Pergolesi
's
``
Stabat_Mater
''
and
all_of
the
Britten
``
Ceremonial
of
Carols
''
.
Their
singing
was be%2:42:03::
well-balanced
,
clear
and
,
within
obvious
limitations
,
extremely
pleasing
.
The
limitations
are be%2:42:06::
those
one
expects expect%2:31:00::
from
untrained
and
unsettled
voices
-
an
occasional
shrillness
of
almost
earsplitting
intensity
,
an
occasional
waver
and
now_and_then
a
bleat
.
But
Mr._Bragg
is be%2:42:03::
a
remarkably
gifted
conductor
,
and
the
results
he
has
produced produce%2:36:02::
with
his
boys
are be%2:42:03::
generally
superior
.
Most
surprising
of
all
,
he
has
accomplished accomplish%2:36:00::
some
prodigies
in
training
for
the
production
of
words
.
The
Latin
,
for_example
,
was be%2:42:03::
not_only
clear
;
it
was be%2:42:03::
even
beautiful
.
Furthermore
,
there
were be%2:42:03::
solid
musical
virtues
in
the
interpretation
of
the
music
.
Lines
came_out come_out%2:30:00::
neatly
and
in
good
balance
.
Tempos
were be%2:42:03::
lively
.
The
piano
accompaniments
by
Istvan_Szelenyi
were be%2:42:03::
stylish
.
A
boy
soprano
named
Dixon_Boyd
sang sing%2:36:01::
a
Durante
solo
motet
and
a_few
other
passages
enchantingly
.
Other
capable
soloists
included include%2:42:00::
David_Clifton
,
Joseph_Schockler
and
Pat_Thompson
.
The
final
group
included include%2:42:00::
folk_songs

home
,
stomped stomp%2:38:00::
out
,
shouted shout%2:32:00::

chanted chant%2:32:01::

irresistible
spirit

in
cowboy
costume
.
Boys
will
be be%2:42:06::
boys
,
and
Texans
will
be be%2:42:06::
Texans

The
combination
proved prove%2:42:00::
quite
irresistible
last
night

company

its
headquarters

opened open%2:41:01::
a
three-week
engagement
at
the
City_Center

night

A
thoroughly
ingratiating
company

is be%2:42:03::
,
and
when

final
curtain
falls fall%2:38:00::
you
may
suddenly
realize realize%2:31:01::
that
you
have
been
sitting sit%2:35:00::
with
a
broad
grin
on
your
face
all
evening
.
Not
that
it
is be%2:42:03::
all
funny
,
by_any_means
,
though
some
of_it
is be%2:42:03::
definitely
so
,
but
simply
that
the
dancers
are be%2:42:03::
young
and
handsome
,
high-spirited
and
communicative
,
and
the
program
itself
is be%2:42:03::
as
vivacious
as_it
is be%2:42:03::
varied
.
There
is be%2:42:03::
no
use
at_all
in
trying try%2:41:00::
to
follow follow%2:31:00::
it
dance
by
dance
and
title
by
title
,
for
it
has have%2:42:00::
a
kind_of
nonstop
format
,
and
moves move%2:41:01::
along
in
an
admirable
continuity
that
demands demand%2:42:00::
no
pauses

The
material
is be%2:42:03::

of
folk

every
section
of
Poland
.
But
under
the
direction
of
Mira_Ziminska-Sygietynska
,
who
with
her
late
husband
founded found%2:41:00::
the
organization
in
1948
,
it
has
all
been
put put%2:35:05::
into
theatrical
form
,
treated treat%2:41:00::
selectively
,
choreographed choreograph%2:36:00::
specifically
for
presentation
to
spectators
,
and
performed perform%2:36:00::
altogether
professionally
.
Under
the
surface
of
the
wide
range
of
folk
movements
is be%2:42:03::
apparent
a
sound
technical
ballet
training
,
and
an
equally
professional
sense
of
performing
.
Since
the
organization
was
created create%2:36:02::
thirteen
years
ago
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
obvious
that
this
is be%2:42:06::
not
the
original
company
;
it
is be%2:42:03::
more
likely
the
sons
and
daughters
of_that
company
.
The
girls
are be%2:42:03::
charming
children
and
the
men
are be%2:42:03::
wonderfully
vital
and
engaging
youngsters
.
The
stage
is be%2:42:03::
constantly
full_of
them
;
indeed
,
there
are be%2:42:03::
never
fewer
than
eight
of
them
on
stage
,
and
that
is be%2:42:03::
only
for
the
more
intimate
numbers
.
They
can
be be%2:42:03::
exuberant
or
sentimental
,
flirtatious
or
funny
,
but
the
only
thing
they
seem seem%2:39:00::
unable
to
be be%2:42:03::
is be%2:42:03::
dull
.
To
pick_out pick_out%2:31:00::
particular
numbers
is be%2:42:03::
something
of
a
problem
,
but
one
or
two
identifiable
items
are be%2:42:03::
too
conspicuously
excellent
to
be
missed miss%2:31:00::
.
There
is be%2:42:03::
for_example
,
a
stunning
Krakowiak
that
closes close%2:41:01::
the
first
act
;
the
mazurka
choreographed choreograph%2:36:00::
by
Witold_Zapala
to
music
from
Moniuszko
's
opera
,
``
Strasny_Dwor
'
,
may
be be%2:42:03::
the_most
beautiful
mazurka
you
are be%2:42:03::
likely
ever
to
see see%2:39:03::
;
there
is be%2:42:03::
an
enchanting
polonaise
;
and
the
dances
and
songs
from
the
Tatras
contain contain%2:42:00::
a
magnificent
dance
for
the
men
.
Everywhere
there
are be%2:42:03::
little
touches
of
humor
,
and
the
leader
of
the
on-stage
band
of
musicians
is be%2:42:03::
an
ebullient
comedian
who
plays play%2:36:01::
all
sorts
of
odd
instruments
with
winning
warmth
.
