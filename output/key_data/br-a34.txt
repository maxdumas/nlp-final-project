One
of
the
initial
questions
put put%2:32:00::
to
President_Kennedy
at
his
first
news_conference
last
January
was be%2:42:03::
about
his
attitude
toward
a
meeting
with
Premier_Khrushchev
.
Mr._Kennedy
replied reply%2:32:00::
:
``
I
'm be%2:42:03::
hopeful
that
from
more
traditional
exchanges
we
can
perhaps
find find%2:40:02::
greater
common
ground
''
.
The
President
knew know%2:31:02::
that
a
confrontation
with
Mr._Khrushchev
sooner_or_later
probably
was be%2:42:03::
inevitable
and
even
desirable
.
But
he
was
convinced convince%2:32:00::
that
the
realities
of
power
-
military
,
economic
and
ideological
-
were be%2:42:03::
the
decisive_factors
in
the
struggle
with
the
Communists
and
that
these
could
not
be
talked talk%2:32:00::
away
at
a
heads
of
government
meeting
.
He
wanted
to
buy_time buy_time%2:30:00::
to
strengthen strengthen%2:30:01::
the
U._S.
and
its
allies
and
to
define define%2:42:00::
and
begin begin%2:30:00::
to
implement implement%2:41:01::
his
foreign_policy
.
Last
Friday
the
White_House
announced announce%2:32:00::
:
President_Kennedy
will
meet meet%2:41:01::
with
Soviet
Premier_Nikita_S._Khrushchev
in
Vienna_June
3
and
4
.
The
announcement
came_after come_after%2:42:00::
a
period
of
sharp
deterioration
in
East-West
relations
.
The
heightened
tension
,
in_fact
,
had
been be%2:42:03::
a
major
factor
in
the
President
's
change
of
view
about
the
urgency
of
a
meeting
with
the
Soviet
leader
.
He
was
not
going_to go_to%2:38:00::
Vienna
to
negotiate negotiate%2:32:00::
-
the
simultaneous
announcements
in
Washington
and
Moscow
last
week
stressed stress%2:32:00::
that
no
formal
negotiations
were
planned plan%2:31:01::
.
But
Mr._Kennedy
had
become become%2:30:00::
convinced
that
a
personal
confrontation
with
Mr._Khrushchev
might
be be%2:42:02::
the
only
way
to
prevent prevent%2:41:01::
catastrophe
.
That
objective
set set%2:30:01::
the
high
stakes
and
drama
of
the
Vienna
meeting
.
Despite
efforts
by
Washington
last
week
to
play_down play_down%2:32:00::
the
significance
of
the
meeting
,
it
clearly
was
going go%2:30:04::
to
be be%2:42:02::
one
of
the
crucial
encounters
of
the
cold_war
.
The
U._S.
and
Soviet
heads
of
Government
have
met meet%2:41:00::
three_times
since
Sir_Winston_Churchill
in
1953
introduced introduce%2:38:00::
a
new
word
into
international
diplomacy
with
his
call_for call_for%2:32:04::
a
fresh
approach
to
the
problem
of
peace
``
at
the
summit
of
the
nations
''
.
The
first
time
was be%2:42:00::
in
1955
when
a
full-dress
Big
Four
summit_meeting
produced produce%2:36:02::
the
``
spirit
of
Geneva
''
.
The
spirit
served serve%2:42:01::
chiefly
to
lull lull%2:37:01::
the
West
while
Moscow
made make%2:36:08::
inroads
into
the
Middle_East
.
In
1959
President_Eisenhower
and
Premier_Khrushchev
held hold%2:36:00::
an
informal
session
in
the
U._S.
.
That
meeting
produced produce%2:36:02::
the
``
spirit
of
Camp_David
''
-
a
spirit
,
it
later
turned_out turn_out%2:42:01::
,
that
masked mask%2:39:00::
a
basic
misunderstanding
about
progress
toward
a
Berlin
settlement
.
On
the
third
occasion
-
another
Big
Four
summit
session
at
Paris
a
year
ago
-
there
was be%2:42:00::
no
problem
of
an
illusory
``
spirit
''
.
Premier_Khrushchev
wrecked wreck%2:35:00::
the
conference
at
its
initial
session
with
a
bitter
denunciation
of
the
U._S.
for
the
U-2
incident
.
The
episode
tended tend%2:42:01::
to
confirm confirm%2:32:00::
the
U._S.
belief
that
propaganda
,
the
hope
of
one-sided
concessions
,
and
the
chance
to
split split%2:41:00::
the
Allies
,
rather_than
genuine
negotiation
,
were be%2:42:03::
the
Soviet
leader
's
real
aims
in
summitry
.
Thus
when
Premier_Khrushchev
intimated intimate%2:32:00::
even
before
inauguration
that
he
hoped hope%2:31:00::
for
an
early
meeting
with
the
new
President
,
Mr._Kennedy
was
confronted confront%2:33:00::
with
a
delicate
problem
.
Shortly
before
his
nomination
he
had
set_forth set_forth%2:32:00::
his
basic
view
about
the
problem
of
negotiations
with
the
Soviet
leader
in
these
words
:
``
As
long
as
Mr._Khrushchev
is be%2:42:03::
convinced
that
the
balance
of
world_power
is
shifting shift%2:30:03::
his
way
,
no
amount
of
either
smiles
or
toughness
,
neither
Camp_David
talks
nor
kitchen
debates
,
can
compel compel%2:41:00::
him
to
enter enter%2:33:00::
fruitful
negotiations
''
.
The
President
had
set set%2:31:04::
for
himself
the
task
,
which
he
believed believe%2:31:04::
vital
,
of
awakening awaken%2:29:00::
the
U._S.
and
its
allies
to
the
hard
and
complex
effort
necessary
to
shift shift%2:30:03::
that
balance
.
He
did
not
want want%2:37:00::
the
effort
weakened weaken%2:30:01::
by
any
illusion
that
summit
magic
might
make make%2:30:00::
it
unnecessary
.
He
wanted want%2:37:00::
time
,
too
,
to
review review%2:31:00::
the
United_States
'
global
commitments
and
to
test test%2:41:00::
both
the
policies
he
had
inherited inherit%2:40:00::
and
new
ones
he
was
formulating formulate%2:32:03::
.
Above_all
,
he
did
not
want want%2:37:00::
to
appear appear%2:39:00::
to
be
running run%2:38:04::
hat
in_hand
to
Premier_Khrushchev
's
doorstep
.
At_the_same_time
the
President
took_pains take_pains%2:41:00::
not
to
rule_out rule_out%2:42:00::
an
eventual
meeting
with
the
Soviet
leader
.
Ideally
,
he
knew know%2:31:01::
,
it
should
be
preceded precede%2:42:01::
by
concrete
progress
at
lower
levels
.
But
Mr._Kennedy
saw see%2:36:00::
value
even
in
an
informal
meeting
,
provided provide%2:40:00::
that
undue
hopes
were
not
raised raise%2:36:01::
in
connection
with_it
.
It
would
give give%2:40:03::
him
an
opportunity
to
take take%2:31:01::
the
measure
of
his
chief
adversary
in
the
cold_war
,
to
try try%2:41:00::
to
probe probe%2:32:00::
Mr._Khrushchev
's
intentions
and
to
make make%2:30:00::
clear
his
own
views
.
Moreover
,
an
eventual
meeting
was be%2:42:03::
desirable
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
satisfy satisfy%2:42:00::
world
opinion
that
the
U._S.
was be%2:42:03::
not
inflexible
and
was
sparing spare%2:40:00::
no
effort
to
ease ease%2:37:00::
international
tensions
.
Both
elements
-
the
caution
about
a
meeting
,
the
willingness
eventually
to
hold hold%2:36:00::
one
-
were
reflected reflect%2:39:01::
in
a
letter
from
the
President
which
Ambassador_Llewellyn_E._Thompson
brought bring%2:38:00::
back
to
Russia
late
in
February
.
The
letter
,
dated date%2:31:02::
Feb.
22
,
was
delivered deliver%2:40:01::
to
Premier_Khrushchev
in
Novosibirsk
,
Siberia
,
on
March
9
.
It
dealt deal%2:32:08::
mainly
with
a
broad
range
of
East-West
issues
.
But
it
also
briefly
suggested suggest%2:32:04::
the
possibility
of
a
meeting
with
Mr._Khrushchev
before
the
end
of
the
year
if
the
international
climate
were be%2:42:03::
favorable
and
schedules
permitted permit%2:32:00::
.
Developments
over
the
next
two
months
,
however
,
caused cause%2:32:00::
the
President
to
reconsider reconsider%2:31:00::
the
question
of
the
timing
.
There
were be%2:42:03::
intense
discussions
in
the
inner
councils
of
the
White_House
about
the
advisability
of
an
early
meeting
,
not
because
the
international
climate
was
improving improve%2:30:01::
,
but
precisely
because
it
was
deteriorating deteriorate%2:29:00::
alarmingly
.
The
President
was be%2:42:03::
especially
concerned concern%2:42:01::
about
the
deadlock
in
the
nuclear
test
ban
negotiations
at
Geneva
.
The
deadlock
has
been
caused cause%2:36:00::
by
the
Russians
'
new
demand
for
a
three-man
(
East
,
West
and
neutral
)
directorate
,
and
thus
a
veto
,
over
the
control
machinery
.
In
the
U._S.
,
strong
pressures
have
been
building_up build_up%2:30:01::
for
a
resumption
of
tests
on
grounds
that
the
Russians
may
be
secretly
testing
.
Mr._Kennedy
was be%2:42:03::
less
troubled
by
that
possibility
than
by
the
belief
that
a
Geneva
breakdown
,
or
even
continued
stalemate
,
would
mean mean%2:42:00::
an
unchecked
spread
of
nuclear_weapons
to
other
countries
as_well
as
a
fatal
blow
to
any
hope
for
disarmament
.
There
was be%2:42:02::
reason
to
believe believe%2:31:04::
that
Premier_Khrushchev
was
also
concerned concern%2:42:01::
about
a
possible
spread
of
nuclear_weapons
,
particularly
to
Communist_China
.
The
question
arose arise%2:42:01::
as
to
whether
a
frank
discussion
of_that
danger
with
the
Soviet
leader
had
not
become become%2:30:00::
urgent
.
Moreover
,
Moscow
appeared appear%2:39:00::
determined
to
apply apply%2:41:06::
the
tripartite
veto
principle
to
the
executive
organs
of
all
international
bodies
,
including include%2:42:00::
the
U._N._Secretariat
and
the
International_Control_Commission
for
Laos
.
Mr._Kennedy
was
convinced convince%2:32:00::
that
insistence
on
the
demand
would
make make%2:30:00::
international
agreements
,
or
even
negotiations
,
impossible
.
Developments
in
Cuba
and
Laos
also
suggested suggest%2:32:04::
the
advisability
of
an
early
summit_meeting
.
Initially
the
White_House
reaction
was be%2:42:03::
that
the
bitter
exchanges
with
Moscow
over
Cuba
and
the
conflict
in
Laos
had
dampened dampen%2:30:05::
prospects
for
a
meeting
.
At_the_same_time
,
there
was be%2:42:04::
increased
reason
for
a
quick
meeting
lest
the
Soviet
leader
,
as
a
result
of
those
episodes
,
come_to come_to%2:41:00::
a
dangerously
erroneous
conclusion
about
the
West
's
ability
and
determination
to
resist resist%2:41:02::
Communist
pressure
.
In
Cuba
,
the
U._S.
had
blundered blunder%2:41:01::
badly
and
created create%2:36:00::
the
impression
of
impotency
against
Communist
penetration
even
on
its
own
doorstep
.
In
Laos
,
the
picture
was be%2:42:03::
almost
equally
bad
.
U._S.
willingness
to
accept accept%2:32:00::
a
neutral
Laos
may
have
led lead%2:32:00::
Premier_Khrushchev
to
believe believe%2:31:04::
that
other
areas
could
be
``
neutralized neutralize%2:41:00::
''
on
Soviet
terms
.
Beyond
that
,
Allied
disagreement
about
military
intervention
in
Laos
-
despite
warnings
that
they
might
do do%2:41:04::
so
-
allowed allow%2:31:00::
Moscow
to
carry_out carry_out%2:36:00::
with
impunity
a
series
of
military
and
diplomatic
moves
that
greatly
strengthened strengthen%2:30:01::
the
pro-Communist
forces
.
As
a
result
,
the
West
is be%2:42:03::
in
a
poor
bargaining
position
at
the
current
Geneva
negotiations
on
Laos
,
and
South_Vietnam
and
other
nations
in
Southeast_Asia
are be%2:42:03::
under
increased
pressure
.
In
the
light
of
those
events
,
there
appeared appear%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:00::
a
real
danger
that
Premier_Khrushchev
might
overreach overreach%2:41:00::
himself
.
Ambassador_Thompson
reported report%2:32:04::
from
Moscow
that
the
Soviet
leader
's
mood
was be%2:42:03::
cocky
and
aggressive
.
He
has
indicated indicate%2:32:03::
that
he
plans plan%2:31:00::
new
moves
on
Berlin
before
the
year
is be%2:42:03::
out
.
The
President
and
his
advisers
felt feel%2:31:00::
that
the
time
might
have
come come%2:38:04::
to
warn warn%2:32:00::
Premier_Khrushchev
against
a
grave
miscalculation
in
areas
such_as
Berlin
,
Iran
or
Latin_America
from
which
there
would
be
no
turning_back turn_back%2:38:00::
.
It
was be%2:42:03::
in_the_midst
of
such
White_House
deliberations
that
Premier_Khrushchev
on
May
4
made make%2:41:00::
new
inquiries
through
the
U._S._Embassy
in
Moscow
about
a
meeting
with
the
President
in
the
near
future
.
Mr._Kennedy
told tell%2:32:04::
Moscow
he
would
give give%2:40:03::
his
answer
by
May
20
after
consultation
with
the
Allies
.
The
response
from
London
,
Paris
and
Bonn
was be%2:42:03::
favorable
.
Firm
arrangements
for
the
meeting
in
Vienna
were
worked_out work_out%2:30:01::
in
a
final
exchange
between
Moscow
and
Washington
last
week
.
Apparently
at
the
insistence
of
the
U._S.
,
the
simultaneous
announcements
issued issue%2:32:00::
in
Washington
and
Moscow
last
Friday
emphasized emphasize%2:32:00::
the
``
informal
''
nature
of
the
meeting
.
The
Washington
announcement
said say%2:32:00::
:
``
The
President
and
Chairman_Khrushchev
understand understand%2:31:01::
that
this

negotiating negotiate%2:32:00::
or
reaching reach%2:41:00::
agreement
on
the
major
international
problems
that
involve involve%2:42:01::
the
interest
of
many
other
countries

The
meeting
will
,
however
,
afford afford%2:40:00::
a
timely
and
convenient
opportunity
for
the
first
personal
contact
between
them
and
a
general
exchange
of
views
on
the
major
issues
which
affect affect%2:30:00::
the
relationships
between
the
two
countries
''
.
The
Vienna
meeting
will
bring_together bring_together%2:35:01::
a
seasoned
,
67
-
year-old
veteran
of
the
cold_war
who
,
in
Mr._Kennedy
's
own
words
,
is be%2:42:03::
``
shrewd
,
tough
,
vigorous
,
well-informed
and
confident
''
,
and
a
44
-
year-old
President
(
his
birthday
is be%2:42:07::
May
29
)
with
a
demonstrated
capacity
for
political
battle
but
little
experience
in
international
diplomacy
.
The
announcement
last
week
of
the
forthcoming
encounter
produced produce%2:39:00::
strong
reactions
in
the
U._S.
of
both
approval
and
disapproval
.
The
approval
did
not
arise arise%2:42:00::
from
an
expectation
of
far-reaching
agreements
at
Vienna
.
The
inclination
was be%2:42:02::
to
accept accept%2:32:00::
the
statement
that
there
would
be be%2:42:00::
no
formal
negotiations
.
But
those
who
were be%2:42:03::
in
favor
of
the
meeting
felt feel%2:31:00::
that
a
frank
exchange
between
the
two
men
and
an
opportunity
to
size size_up%2:39:00::
one
another
up
would
prove prove%2:42:00::
salutary
.
Mr._Khrushchev
is
known know%2:31:01::
to
rely rely%2:31:11::
heavily
on
his
instincts
about
his
adversaries
and
to
be be%2:42:03::
a
shrewd
judge
of
men
.
The
feeling
was be%2:42:02::
that
he
would
sense sense%2:39:00::
an
inner
core
of
toughness
and
determination
in
the
President
and
that
plain
talk
by
Mr._Kennedy
would
give give%2:40:03::
him
pause
.
Apart
from
the
personal_equation
,
another
reason
advanced advance%2:30:00::
in
favor
of
the
meeting
was be%2:42:03::
that
too
often
in_the_past
the
U._S.
appeared appear%2:39:00::
to
have
been
dragged drag%2:35:00::
reluctantly
to
the
summit
.
Premier_Khrushchev
has
made make%2:41:00::
propaganda
capital
out
of_that
fact
and
in_the_end
got get%2:30:03::
his
summit_meeting
anyway
.
This
time
the
initiative
came come%2:30:01::
,
in_part
at_least
,
from
Washington
.
There
was be%2:42:00::
also
the
fact
that
by
the
time
he
meets meet%2:38:00::
Mr._Khrushchev
,
the
President
will
have
completed complete%2:30:02::
conversations
with
all
the
other
principal
Allied
leaders
.
Thus
he
will
be be%2:42:03::
in
a
position
to
disabuse disabuse%2:32:00::
the
Soviet
leader
of
any
notions
he
may
have have%2:40:04::
about
grave
Allied
disunity
.
Finally
,
there
was be%2:42:03::
a
wide
area
of
agreement
on
the
value
of
the
President
's
making make%2:41:00::
a
final
