One
of
the
inescapable
realities
of
the
Cold_War
is be%2:42:03::
that_is
has
thrust thrust%2:38:00::
upon
the
West
a
wholly
new
and
historically
unique
set
of
moral
dilemmas
.
The
first
dilemma
was be%2:42:06::
the
morality
of
nuclear
warfare
itself
.
That
dilemma
is be%2:42:04::
as
much
with
us
as
ever
.
The
second
great
dilemma
has
been be%2:42:06::
the
morality
of
nuclear
testing
,
a
dilemma
which
has
suddenly
become become%2:30:00::
acute
because
of
the
present
series
of
Soviet
tests
.
When
this
second
dilemma
first
became become%2:30:00::
obvious
-
during
the
mid
to
late
'
50
's
-
the
United_States
appeared appear%2:39:00::
to
have have%2:40:00::
three
choices
.
It
could
have
unilaterally
abandoned abandon%2:40:00::
further
testing
on
the
grounds
of
the
radiation
hazard
to
future
generations
.
It
could
have
continued continue%2:42:00::
testing
to_the_full
on
the
grounds
that
the
radiation
danger
was be%2:42:03::
far
less_than
the
danger
of
Communist
world
domination
.
Or
it
could
have
chosen choose%2:31:01::
to
find find%2:40:02::
-
by
negotiation
-
some
way
of
stopping stop%2:42:00::
the
tests
without
loss
to
national
security
.
This
third
choice
was
in_fact
made make%2:41:00::
.
With
the
resumption
of
Soviet
testing
and
their
intransigence
at
the
Geneva
talks
,
however
,
the
hope
that
this
third
choice
would
prove prove%2:42:00::
viable
has
been
shaken shake%2:30:00::
.
Once_again
,
the
United_States
must
choose choose%2:31:00::
.
And
once_again
,
the
choices
are be%2:42:03::
much
the
same
.
Only
this
time
around
the
conditions
are be%2:42:03::
different
and
the
choice
is be%2:42:03::
far
harder
.
The
first
choice
,
abandoning abandon%2:40:00::
tests
entirely
,
would
not_only
be be%2:42:03::
unpopular
domestically
,
but
would
surely
be
exploited exploit%2:34:00::
by
the
Russians
.
The
second
choice
,
full
testing
,
has
become become%2:30:00::
even
more
risky
just
because
the
current
Soviet
tests
have
already
dangerously
contaminated contaminate%2:30:01::
the
atmosphere
.
The
third
choice
,
negotiation
,
presupposes presuppose%2:31:01::
,
as
Russian
behavior
demonstrates demonstrate%2:31:00::
,
a
great_deal
of
wishful_thinking
to
make make%2:30:00::
it
appear appear%2:39:00::
reasonable
.
We
take
the
position
,
however
,
that
the
third
choice
still
remains remain%2:30:00::
the
only
sane
one
open_to
us
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
a
happy
choice
and
the
arguments
against
it
as
a
practical
strategy
are be%2:42:03::
formidable
.
Its
primary
advantage
is be%2:42:03::
that
it
is be%2:42:06::
a
moral
choice
;
one
which
,
should
it
fail fail%2:41:00::
,
will
not
have
contaminated contaminate%2:30:00::
the
conscience
.
That
is be%2:42:06::
the
contamination
we
most
fear fear%2:37:00::
.
LEAVING leave%2:31:05::
ASIDE
the
choice
of
unilateral
cessation
of
tests
as
neither
sane
nor
clearly
moral
,
the
question
must
arise arise%2:42:01::
as
to
why
resumption
of
atmospheric
tests
on
our
part
would
not
be be%2:42:03::
a
good
choice
.
For
that
is be%2:42:06::
the
one
an
increasingly
large_number
of
prominent
Americans
are
now
proposing propose%2:31:00::
.
In_particular
,
Governor_Nelson_Rockefeller
has
expressed express%2:32:00::
as
cogently
and
clearly
as
anyone
the
case
for
a
resumption
of
atmospheric
tests
.
Speaking speak%2:32:03::
recently
in
Miami
,
Governor_Rockefeller
said say%2:32:00::
that
``
to
assure assure%2:31:00::
the
sufficiency
of
our
own
weapons
in
the
face
of
the
recent
Soviet
tests
,
we
are
now
clearly
compelled compel%2:41:00::
to
conduct conduct%2:41:00::
our
own
nuclear
tests
''
.
Taking_account take_account%2:31:12::
of
the
fact
that
such
a
move
on
our
part
would
be be%2:42:03::
unpopular
in
world
opinion
,
he
argued argue%2:32:02::
that
the
responsibility
of
the
United_States
is be%2:42:06::
``
to
do do%2:36:01::
,
confidently
and
firmly
,
not
what
is be%2:42:03::
popular
,
but
what
is be%2:42:03::
right
''
.
What
was be%2:42:03::
missing
in
the
Governor
's
argument
,
as
in
so
many
similar
arguments
,
was be%2:42:03::
a
premise
which
would
enable enable%2:30:00::
one
to
make make%2:41:00::
the
ethical
leap
from
what
might
be be%2:42:03::
militarily
desirable
to
what
is be%2:42:03::
right
.
The
possibility
,
as
he
asserted assert%2:32:01::
,
that
the
Russians
may
get_ahead get_ahead%2:33:00::
of
us
or
come come%2:38:00::
closer
to
us
because
of
their
tests
does
not
supply supply%2:40:00::
the
needed
ethical
premise
-
unless
,
of_course
,
we
have
unwittingly
become become%2:30:00::
so
brutalized
that
nuclear
superiority
is
now
taken take%2:31:07::
as
a
moral
demand
.
Besides
the
lack
of
an
adequate
ethical
dimension
to
the
Governor
's
case
,
one
can
ask ask%2:32:00::
seriously
whether
our
lead
over
the
Russians
in
quality
and
quantity
of
nuclear_weapons
is be%2:42:03::
so
slight
as
to
make make%2:30:00::
the
tests
absolutely
necessary
.
Recent
statements
by
the
President
and
Defense_Department
spokesmen
have
,
to_the_contrary
,
assured assure%2:37:00::
us
that
our
lead
is be%2:42:03::
very
great
.
Unless
the
Administration
and
the
Defense_Department
have
been
deceiving deceive%2:32:00::
us
,
the
facts
do
not
support support%2:31:00::
the
assertion
that
we
are be%2:42:03::
``
compelled
''
to
resume resume%2:41:00::
atmospheric
testing
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
perfectly
conceivable
that
a
resumption
of
atmospheric
tests
may
,
at
some
point
in_the_future
,
be be%2:42:03::
necessary
and
even
justifiable
.
But
a
resumption
does
not
seem seem%2:39:00::
justifiable
now
.
What
we
need need%2:42:01::
to
realize realize%2:31:00::
is be%2:42:03::
that
the
increasingly
great
contamination
of
the
atmosphere
by
the
Soviet
tests
has
radically
increased increase%2:30:02::
our
own
moral_obligations
.
We
now
have have%2:42:05::
to
think think_of%2:31:00::
not_only
of
our
national
security
but
also
of
the
future
generations
who
will
suffer suffer%2:29:00::
from
any
tests
we
might
undertake undertake%2:36:00::
.
This
is be%2:42:06::
an
ethical
demand
which
cannot
be
evaded evade%2:32:00::
or
glossed_over gloss_over%2:41:00::
by
talking talk%2:32:01::
exclusively
of
weapon
superiority
or
even
of
the
evil
of
Communism
.
Too
often
in_the_past
Russian
tactics
have
been
used use%2:34:01::
to
justify justify%2:32:01::
like
tactics
on
our
part
.
There
ought_to
be be%2:42:03::
a
point
beyond
which
we
will
not
allow allow%2:32:00::
ourselves
to
go go%2:41:00::
regardless_of
what
Russia
does do%2:36:01::
.
The
refusal
to
resume resume%2:41:00::
atmospheric
testing
would
be be%2:42:06::
a
good
start
.
When
his
Holiness
Pope_John
23
,
first
called_for call_for%2:32:04::
an
Ecumenical_Council
,
and
at_the_same_time
voiced voice%2:32:00::
his
yearning
for
Christian
unity
,
the
enthusiasm
among
Catholic
and
Protestant
ecumenicists
was be%2:42:03::
immediate
.
With
good
reason
it
appeared appear%2:39:00::
that
a
new
day
was be%2:42:03::
upon
divided
Christendom
.
But
as
the
more
concrete
plans
for
the
work
of
the
Council
gradually
became become%2:30:00::
known
,
there
was be%2:42:04::
a
rather
sharp
and
abrupt
disappointment
on_all_sides
.
The
Council
we
now
know know%2:31:01::
will
concern concern%2:42:00::
itself
directly
only
with
the
internal
affairs
of
the
Church
.
As
it
has
turned_out turn_out%2:42:01::
,
however
,
the
excessive
enthusiasm
in
the
first
instance
and
the
loss
of
hope
in
the
second
were be%2:42:06::
both
wrong
responses
.
Two
things
have
happened happen%2:30:00::
in
recent
months
to
bring bring%2:35:04::
the
Council
into
perspective
:
each
provides provide%2:40:00::
a
basis
for
renewed
hope
and
joy
.
First_of_all
,
it
is
now
known know%2:31:01::
that
Pope_John
sees see%2:31:00::
the
renewal
and
purification
of
the
Church
as
an
absolutely
necessary
step
toward
Christian
unity
.
Far
from
being be%2:42:03::
irrelevant
to
the
ecumenical
task
,
the
Pontiff
believes believe%2:31:00::
that
a
revivified
Church
is be%2:42:03::
required
in_order
that
the
whole
world
may
see see%2:31:00::
Catholicism
in
the
best
possible
light
.
Equally
significant
,
Pope_John
has
said say%2:32:00::
that
Catholics
themselves
bear bear%2:40:02::
some
responsibility
for
Christian
disunity
.
A
major
aim
of
the
Council
will
be be%2:42:03::
to
remove remove%2:30:00::
as_far_as_possible
whatever
in
the
Church
today
stands stand%2:42:03::
in
the
way
of
unity
.
Secondly
,
a
whole
series
of
addresses
and
actions
by
the
Pope
and
by
others
show show%2:32:00::
that
concern
for
Christian
unity
is be%2:42:03::
still
very_much
alive
and
growing
within
the
Church
.
The
establishment
,
by
the
Holy_Father
,
of
a
permanent
Secretariat
for
Christian_Unity
in
1960
was be%2:42:06::
the_most
dramatic
mark
of_this
concern
.
The
designation
of
five
Catholic
theologians
to
attend attend%2:42:00::
the
World_Council
of
Churches
assembly
in
New_Delhi
as
``
official
''
observers
reverses reverse%2:30:01::
the
Church
's
earlier
stand
.
The
public
appeal
by
the
new
Vatican
Secretary_of_State
,
Cardinal_Cicognani
,
for
renewed
efforts
toward
Eastern
and
Western
reunion
was be%2:42:06::
still
another
remarkable
act
.
Nor
can
one
forget forget%2:31:01::
Pope_John
's
unprecedented
meeting
with
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
.
Augustin_Cardinal_Bea
,
the
director
of
the
Secretariate
for
Christian_Unity
,
has
expressed express%2:32:01::
as
directly
as
anyone
the
new
spirit
that
pervades pervade%2:35:00::
the
Church
's
stance
toward
the
Protestant
and
Orthodox_Churches
.
Noting note%2:39:02::
all
the
difficulties
that
stand stand%2:42:03::
in
the
way
of
reunion
,
he
has
said say%2:32:00::
that
they
ought
not
to
discourage discourage%2:37:00::
anyone
.
For
discouragement
,
or
the
temptation
to
abandon abandon%2:40:00::
our
efforts
,
``
would
show show%2:39:02::
that
one
placed place%2:35:00::
excessive
trust
in
purely
human
means
without
thinking think%2:31:00::
of
the
omnipotence
of
God
,
the
irresistible
efficacy
of
prayer
,
the
action
of
Christ
or
the
power
of
the
Divine_Spirit
''
.
Can
any
Christian
fail fail%2:41:02::
to
respond respond%2:31:00::
to
these
words
?
The
administration
's
official
budget
review
,
which
estimates estimate%2:31:01::
a
6.9
billion
dollar
deficit
for
the
current
fiscal_year
,
is
n't
making make%2:30:00::
anyone
happy
.
Certainly
it
is
n't
making make%2:30:00::
the
President
happy
,
and
he
has
been
doing do%2:41:01::
his
apologetic
best
to
explain explain%2:32:02::
how
the
budget
got get%2:30:00::
into
its
unbalanced
condition
,
how
he
intends intend%2:31:01::
to
economize economize%2:40:00::
wherever
he
can
and_how
he
hopes hope%2:37:01::
to
do do%2:36:01::
better
next
year
.
We
sympathize sympathize%2:37:01::
with
Mr._Kennedy
,
but
we
feel feel%2:37:00::
bound
to
say say%2:32:00::
that
his
budget
review
does
n't
please please%2:37:00::
us
either
,
although
for
very
different
reasons
.
Furthermore
,
we
find find%2:31:10::
his
defense
of
the
unbalanced
budget
more
dismaying
than
reassuring
.
In_the_first_place
,
a
large
part
of
the
discrepancy
between
President_Eisenhower
's
estimate
of
a
1.5
billion
dollar
surplus
for
the
same
period
and
the
new
estimate
of
an
almost
seven
billion
dollar
deficit
is be%2:42:03::
the
result
of
the
outgoing
President
's
farewell
gift
of
a
political
booby-trap
to
his
successor
.
The
Eisenhower
budget
was be%2:42:03::
simultaneously
inadequate
in
its
provisions
and
yet
extravagant
in
its
projections
of
revenue
to
be
received receive%2:40:00::
.
The
rest
of
the
deficit
is be%2:42:03::
also
easily
understood
.
Four
billion
dollars
of
the
spending
increase
is be%2:42:03::
for
defense
,
an
expenditure
necessitated necessitate%2:42:01::
by
the
penny-wise
policies
of
the
Eisenhhower_Administration
,
quite
apart
from
the
recent
crises
in
Berlin
and
elsewhere
.
Four_hundred
million
dollars
of
the
increase
is be%2:42:03::
for
the
expanded
space
program
,
a
responsibility
similarly
neglected neglect%2:31:00::
by
Mr._Eisenhower
.
The
farm
program
will
cost cost%2:42:00::
an
additional
1.5
billion
,
because
of
unusual
weather
factors
,
the
Food
for
Peace
program
and
other
new
measures
.
Anti-recession
programs
-
aid
for
the
unemployed
,
their
children
and
for
depressed
areas
-
account_for account_for%2:42:00::
only
900
million
of
the
6.9
billion
dollar
deficit
.
Our
complaint
is be%2:42:03::
that
in
many
crucial
areas
the
Kennedy
programs
are be%2:42:03::
not
too
large
but
too
small
,
most
seriously
in
regard_to
the
conventional
arms
build-up
and
in
aid
and
welfare
measures
.
And
yet
Mr._Kennedy
persists persist%2:30:01::
in
trying try%2:41:00::
to
mollify mollify%2:37:00::
the
intransigents
of
the
right
with
apologies
and
promises
of
``
tightening_up
''
and
``
economizing
''
.
We
wish wish%2:37:00::
the
President
would
remember remember%2:31:01::
that
``
fiscal
responsibility
''
was be%2:42:06::
the
battle-cry
of
the
party
that
lost lose%2:33:00::
the
election
.
The
party
that
won win%2:33:00::
used_to
say say%2:32:00::
something
about
a
New_Frontier
.
Introduction
of
the
``
dialogue
''
principle
proved prove%2:42:00::
strikingly
effective
at
the
thirty-fourth
annual
meeting
of
the
Catholic_Association
for
International_Peace
in
Washington
the
last
weekend
in
October
.
Two
of
the
principal
addresses
were
delivered deliver%2:32:00::
by
prominent
Protestants
,
and
when
the
speaker
was be%2:42:06::
a
Catholic
,
one
``
discussant
''
on
the
dais
tended_to
be be%2:42:02::
of
another
religious
persuasion
.
Several
effects
were be%2:42:03::
immediately
evident
.
Sessions
devoted_to
``
Ethics
and
Foreign_Policy
Trends
''
,
``
Moral_Principle
and
Political
Judgment
''
,
``
Christian_Ethics
in
the
Cold_War
''
and
related
subjects
proved prove%2:42:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
much
livelier
under
this
procedure
than
if
Catholics
were
merely
talking talk%2:32:01::
to
themselves
.
Usually
questions
from
the
floor
were
directed direct%2:33:01::
to
the
non-Catholic
speaker
or
discussion
leader
.
In
the
earlier
sessions
there
was be%2:42:04::
plentiful
discussion
on
the
natural_law
,
which
Dr._William_V._O
'
Brien
of
Georgetown_University
,
advanced advance%2:32:00::
as
the
basis
for
widely
acceptable
ethical
judgments
on
foreign_policy
.
That
Aristotelean-Thomistic
principle
experienced experience%2:39:01::
a
thorough
going-over
from
a_number_of
the
participants
,
but
in_the_end
the
concept
came
to
reassert reassert%2:32:00::
itself
.
Speakers
declared declare%2:32:00::
that
Protestants
often
make make%2:30:00::
use
of
it
,
if
,
perhaps
,
by
some
other
name
.
A
Lebanese
Moslem
told tell%2:32:01::
about
its
existence
and
application
in
the
Islamic
tradition
as
the
``
divine
law
''
,
while
a
C._A._I._P.
member
who

Another
question
that
arose arise%2:42:01::
was be%2:42:03::
the
nature

dialogue
itself

The
stimulus

It
was

that

would
produce produce%2:36:02::
a

better

But
a

One
effect

was be%2:42:06::
to
focus focus%2:31:00::
attention
on

the
