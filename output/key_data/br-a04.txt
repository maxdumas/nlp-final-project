the

This

On_the_negative_side
of
the
balance_sheet
must
be
set set%2:35:00::
some
disappointment
that
the
United_States
leadership
has
not
been be%2:42:03::
as
much
in_evidence
as
hoped_for
.
One
diplomat
described describe%2:32:01::
the
tenor
of
Secretary_of_State
Dean_Rusk
's
speeches
as
``
inconclusive
''
.
But
he
hastened hasten%2:30:00::
to
add add%2:32:01::
that
,
if
United_States
policies
were be%2:42:03::
not
always
clear
,
despite
Mr._Rusk
's
analysis
of
the
various
global
danger
points
and
setbacks
for
the
West
,
this
may
merely
mean mean%2:42:00::
the
new
administration
has
not_yet
firmly
fixed fix%2:32:03::
its
policy
.
A
certain
vagueness
may
also
be
caused cause%2:36:00::
by
tactical
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
the
present
council
meeting
is be%2:42:03::
a
semipublic
affair
,
with
no_fewer_than
six
Soviet
correspondents
accredited accredit%2:41:00::
.
The
impression
has
nevertheless
been
given give%2:40:05::
during
these
three
days
,
despite
Mr._Rusk
's
personal
popularity
,
that
the
United_States
delegation
came come%2:38:04::
to
Oslo
in
a
somewhat
tentative
and
exploratory
frame_of_mind
,
more
ready_to

than
to
enunciate enunciate%2:32:00::
firm
policy
on
a
global
scale
with
detailed
application
to
individual
danger
spots
.
The
Secretary_of_State
himself
,
in
his
first
speech
,
gave give%2:40:05::
some
idea
of
the
tremendous
march
of
events
inside
and
outside
the
United_States
that
has
preoccupied preoccupy%2:42:00::
the
new
administration
in_the_past
four
months
.
But
where
the
core
of
NATO
is be%2:42:03::
concerned
,
the
Secretary_of_State
has
not_only
reiterated reiterate%2:32:00::
the
United_States
'
profound
attachment
to
the
alliance
,
``
cornerstone
''
of
its
foreign_policy
,
but
has
announced announce%2:32:02::
that
five
nuclear
submarines
will
eventually
be be%2:42:05::
at
NATO
's
disposal
in
European
waters
.
The
Secretary_of_State
has
also
solemnly
repeated repeat%2:32:00::
a
warning
to
the
Soviet_Union
that
the
United_States
will
not
stand_for stand_for%2:31:00::
another
setback
in
Berlin
,
an
affirmation
once_again
taken_up take_up%2:30:00::
by
the
council
as_a_whole
.
The
secretary
's
greatest
achievement
is be%2:42:06::
perhaps
the
rekindling
of
NATO
realization
that
East-West
friction
,
wherever
it
take_place take_place%2:30:00::
around
the

is be%2:42:03::
in_essence
the

must
be
treated treat%2:41:00::
as_such
without

geographical
distance
or
lack
of
apparent
connection
.
The
annual
spring
meeting
has
given give%2:40:00::
an
impetus
in
three
main
directions
:
more
,
deeper
,
and
more
timely
political
consultation
within
the
alliance
,
the
use
of
the
Organization

Economic_Cooperation

(

as
a
method

This

any_more

Mr._Nixon

Until
