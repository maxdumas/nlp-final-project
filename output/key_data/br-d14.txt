the
morals

country
?
A
complete
picture
is be%2:42:03::
impossible
-
partly
because
of
the
limitations
of
space
,
partly
because
for
millions
of
individuals
who
professed profess%2:32:03::
allegiance
to
the
Christian
faith
data
are be%2:42:03::
unobtainable
.
Even
more
of
an
obstacle
is be%2:42:06::
the
difficulty
of
separating separate%2:31:01::
the
influence
of
Christianity
from
other
factors
.
Although
a
complete
picture
cannot
be
given give%2:36:00::
,
we
can
indicate indicate%2:32:00::
some
aspects
of
life
into
which
the
Christian
faith
entered enter%2:42:00::
as
at_least
one
creative
factor
.
At_times
we
can
say say%2:32:00::
that
it
was be%2:42:03::
the
major
factor
.
What
in
some
ways
was be%2:42:03::
the_most
important
aspect
was be%2:42:06::
the
impact
individually
on
the
millions
who
constituted constitute%2:42:00::
the
nation
.
As
we
have
seen see%2:39:02::
,
a
growing
proportion
,
although
in
1914
still
a
minority
,
were be%2:42:06::
members
of
churches
.
Presumably
those
who
did
not
have have%2:40:00::
a
formal
church
connexion
had
also
felt feel%2:39:01::
the
influence
of
Christianity
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
.
Many_of
them
had
once
been be%2:42:06::
members
of
a
church
or
at_least
had
been
given give%2:40:09::
instruction
in
Christianity
but
for
one
or
another
reason
had
allowed allow%2:32:00::
the
connexion
to
lapse lapse%2:30:01::
.
The
form
of
Christianity
to_which
they
were
exposed expose%2:39:02::
was be%2:42:06::
for
some
the
Protestantism
of
the
older
stock
,
for
others
the
Protestantism
of
the
nineteenth-century
immigration
;
for
still
others
,
mostly
of
the
nineteenth-century
immigration
,
it
was be%2:42:06::
Roman_Catholicism
,
and
for
a
small
minority
it
was be%2:42:06::
Eastern_Orthodoxy
.
Upon
all_of
them
played play%2:38:00::
the
intellectual
,
social
,
political
,
and
economic
attitudes
,
institutions
,
and
customs
of
the
nation
.
Upon
most_of
these
Christianity
had
left leave%2:31:05::
an
impress
and
through
them
had
had
a
share
in
making make%2:30:00::
the
individual
what
he
was be%2:42:06::
.
Yet
to
determine determine%2:32:00::
precisely
to_what_extent
and
exactly
in_what
ways
any
individual
showed show%2:39:00::
the
effects
of
Christianity
would
be be%2:42:03::
impossible
.
At_best
only
an
approximation
could
be
arrived_at arrive_at%2:38:00::
.
To
generalize generalize%2:32:01::
for
the
entire
nation
would
be be%2:42:03::
absurd
.
For_instance
,
we
cannot
know know%2:31:02::
whether
even
for
church_members
the
degree
of
conformity
to
Christian
standards
of
morality
increased increase%2:30:02::
or
declined decline%2:30:01::
as
the
proportion
of
church_members
in
the
population
rose rise%2:30:03::
.
The
temptation
is be%2:42:06::
to
say say%2:32:01::
that
,
as
the
percentage
of
church_members
mounted mount%2:30:00::
,
the
degree
of
discipline
exercised exercise%2:41:00::
by
the
churches
lessened lessen%2:30:00::
and
the
trend
was be%2:42:05::
towards
conformity
to
the
general
level
.
Yet
this
cannot
be
proved prove%2:31:00::
.
We
know know%2:31:01::
that
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
many
Protestant
congregations
took take%2:41:04::
positive
action
against
members
who
transgressed transgress%2:41:00::
the
ethical_codes
to_which
the
majority
subscribed subscribe%2:32:03::
.
Thus
Baptist
churches
on
the
frontier
took
cognizance
of
charges
against
their
members
of
drunkenness
,
fighting
,
malicious_gossip
,
lying
,
cheating
,
sexual
irregularities
,
gambling
,
horse_racing
,
and
failure
to
pay pay%2:40:04::
just
debts
.
If
guilty
,
the
offender
might
be
excluded exclude%2:32:01::
from
membership
.
As
church
membership
burgeoned burgeon%2:30:01::
,
such
measures
faded fade%2:30:02::
into
desuetude
.
But
whether
this
was
accompanied accompany%2:42:00::
by
a
general
lowering
of
the
moral
life
of
the
membership
we
do
not
know know%2:31:01::
.
What
we
can
attempt attempt%2:41:00::
with
some
hope
of
dependable
conclusions
is
to
point_out point_out%2:32:03::
the
manner
in_which
Christianity
entered enter%2:42:00::
into
particular
aspects
of
the
life
of
the
nation
.
We
have
already
hinted hint%2:32:00::
at
the
fashion
in_which
Christianity
contributed contribute%2:40:01::
to
education
and
so
to
intellectual
life
.
We
will
now
speak speak%2:32:01::
of
the
ways
in_which
it
helped help%2:41:00::
shape shape%2:31:00::
the
ideals
of
the
country
and
of
the
manner
in_which
it
stimulated stimulate%2:29:00::
efforts
to
attain attain%2:41:00::
those
ideals
through
reform_movements

through
programmes
for
bringing bring%2:35:04::
the
collective
life
to
the
nation
to
conformity
to
Christian
standards
,
and
through
leaders
in
the
government
.
Throughout
the
nineteenth
century
Christianity
exerted exert%2:34:00::
its
influence
on
American
society
as_a_whole
primarily
through
the
Protestantism
of
the
older
stock
.
By
the
end
of
the
century
the
Roman_Catholic_Church
was
beginning begin%2:30:00::
to
make make%2:30:00::
itself
felt feel%2:39:01::
,
mainly
through
such
institutions
as
hospitals
but
also
through
its
attitude
towards
organized
labour
.
In
the
twentieth
century
its
influence
grew grow%2:30:00::
,
as
did
that
of
the
Protestantism
of
the
nineteenth-century
immigration
.
The
ideals
of
the
country
were
deeply
indebted
to
the
Protestantism
of
the
older
stock
.
Thus
``
America
''
,
the_most
widely
sung sing%2:36:01::
of
the
patriotic
songs
,
was
written write%2:36:00::
by
a
New_England
Baptist
clergyman
,
Samuel_Francis_Smith
(
1808
-
1895
)
,
while
a
student
in
Andover_Theological_Seminary
.
With
its
zeal
for
liberty
and
its
dependence
on
God
it
breathed
the
spirit
which
had
been
nourished nourish%2:34:00::
on
the
Evangelical
revivals
.
The
great_seal
of
the
United_States
was
obviously
inspired inspire%2:37:00::
by
the
Christian
faith
.
Here
was be%2:42:04::
what
was
called call%2:32:02::
the
American_dream
,
namely
,
the
effort
to
build build%2:36:00::
a
structure
which
would
be be%2:42:03::
something
new
in
history
and
to
do
so
in
such
fashion
that
God
could
bless bless%2:32:00::
it
.
Later
in
the
century
the
dream
again
found find%2:30:00::
expression
in
the
lines
of
Katherine_Lee_Bates
(
1859
-
1929
)
,
daughter
and
granddaughter
of
New_England
Congregational
ministers
,
in
her
widely
sung
hymn
,
written write%2:36:00::
in
1893
,
``
America
the
Beautiful
''
,
with
the
words
``
O
beautiful

and

''
.
The
American_dream
was
compounded compound%2:30:00::
of
many
strains
.
Some
were be%2:42:03::
clearly
of
Christian
origin
,
among
them
the
Great_Awakening
and
other
revivals
which
helped help%2:41:00::
to
make make%2:30:00::
Christian
liberty
,
Christian
equality
,
and
Christian
fraternity
the
passion
of
the
land
.
Some
have
seen see%2:31:00::
revivalism
and
the
search
for
Christian
perfection
as
the
fountain-head
of
the
American
hope
.
Here
,
too
,
must
be
placed place%2:40:00::
Unitarianism
and
,
less
obviously
from
Christian
inspiration
,
Emerson
,
Transcendentalism
,
and
the
idealism
of
Walt_Whitman
.
We
must
also
remember remember%2:31:00::
those
who
reacted react%2:31:00::
against
the
dream
as
a
kind_of
myth
-
among
them
Melville
,
Hawthorne
,
and
Henry_James
the
elder
,
all_of
them
out
of
a
Christian
background
.
With
such
a
dream
arising arise%2:42:00::

at_least
in_part
,
from
the
Protestant
heritage
of
the
United_States
and
built build%2:36:00::
into
the
foundations
of
the
nation

it
is be%2:42:03::
not
surprising
that
many
efforts
were
made make%2:41:00::
to
give
it
concrete
expression

A
number
were be%2:42:03::
in
the
nature
of
movements
to
relieve relieve%2:29:02::

Significantly

the
initiation
and
leadership
of
a
major
proportion
of
the
reform_movements
,
especially
those
in
the
first_half
of
the
nineteenth

came come%2:42:04::
from
men

from
either
Trinitarian

Several
of
the
movements
were
given give%2:36:03::
a

impetus
by
revivalism

Quakers

some
from

had have%2:40:00::
