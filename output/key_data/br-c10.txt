``
Ring
of
Bright_Water
''
by
Gavin_Maxwell
is be%2:42:03::
just
that
-
a
haunting
,
warmly
personal
chronicle
of
a
man
,
an
otter
,
and
a
remote
cottage
in
the
Scottish_West_Highlands
.
``
He
has
married marry%2:41:00::
me
with
a

water
''
,
begins begin%2:30:00::
the
Kathleen_Raine
poem
from
which
Maxwell
takes take%2:31:01::
his
title
,
and
it
is be%2:42:06::
this
mystic
bond
between
the
human
and
natural
world
that
the
author
conveys convey%2:32:01::
.
The
place
is be%2:42:06::
Camusfearna
,
the
site
of
a
long-vanished
sea-village
opposite
the
isle
of
Skye
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
a
land
of
long
fjords
,
few
people
,
a
single-lane
road
miles
away
-
and
of
wild
stags
,
Greylag_geese
,
wild
swans
,
dolphins
and
porpoises
playing play%2:41:03::
in
the
waters

How
Maxwell
recounts recount%2:32:00::
his
first
coming
to
Camusfearna
,
his
furnishing furnish%2:40:01::
the
empty
house
with
beach-drift
,
the
subtle
changes
in
season
over
ten
years
,
is be%2:42:03::
a
moving
experience
.
Just
the
evocations
of
time
and
place
,
of
passionate
encounter
between
man
and
a
natural
world
which
today
seems seem%2:39:00::
almost
lost
,
would
be be%2:42:03::
enough
.
But
it
is be%2:42:03::
n't
.
There
is be%2:42:00::
Mijbil
,
an
otter
who
travelled travel%2:38:00::
with
Maxwell
-
and
gave give%2:40:00::
Maxwell
's
name
to
a
new
species
-
from
the
Tigris
marshes
to
his
London
flat
.
It
may
sound sound%2:39:06::
extravagant
to
say say%2:32:00::
that
there
has
never
been be%2:42:00::
a
more
engaging
animal
in_all
literature
.
This
is be%2:42:03::
not_only
a
compliment
to
Mijbil
,
of
whom
there
are be%2:42:00::
a
fine
series
of
photographs
and
drawings
in
the
book
,
but
to
the
author
who
has
catalogued catalogue%2:36:00::
the
saga
of
a
frightened
otter
cub
's
journey
by
plane
from
Iraq
to
London
,
then
by
train
(
where
he
lay lie%2:42:00::
curled
in
the
wash
basin
playing play%2:41:00::
with
the
water

to
Camusfearna
,
with
affectionate
detail
.
Mij
,
as
his
owner
was
soon
to
learn learn%2:31:00::
,
had have%2:40:00::
strange
,
inexplicable
habits
.
He
liked like%2:37:01::
to
nip nip%2:35:00::
ear
lobes
of
unsuspecting
visitors
with
his
needle-sharp
teeth
.
He
preferred prefer%2:37:00::
sleeping sleep%2:29:00::
in
bed
with
his
head
on
a
pillow
.
Systematically
he
would
open open%2:35:00::
and
ransack ransack%2:35:02::
drawers
.
Given give%2:40:00::
a
small
ball
or
marbles
,
he
would
invent invent%2:36:00::
games
and
play play%2:41:03::
by
himself
for
hours
.
With
curiosity
and
elan
,
he
explored explore%2:31:00::
every_inch

beach
and
burn
,
once
stranding strand%2:40:00::
himself
for
hours
on
a

high_up
a
sheer
seventy-foot
cliff
and
waiting wait%2:42:00::
with
calm
faith
to
be
rescued rescue%2:41:00::
by
Maxwell
,
who
nearly
lost lose%2:40:02::
his
life
in
doing
so
.
A
year
and
a
day
of_this
idyll
is
described describe%2:32:00::
for
the
reader
,
one
in_which
not_only
discovery
of
a
new_world
of
personality
is
charted chart%2:31:13::
,
but
self-discovery
as_well
.
In
the
solitude
of
Camusfearna
there
had
been be%2:42:00::
no
loneliness
.
``
To
be be%2:42:03::
quite
alone
where
there
are be%2:42:00::
no
other
human_beings
is be%2:42:03::
sharply
exhilarating
;
it
is be%2:42:03::
as
though
some
pressure
had
suddenly
been_lifted
,
allowing allow%2:41:00::
an
intense
awareness
&
&
&
a
sharpening
of
the
senses
''
.
Now
,
with
the
increasing
interdependence
between
himself
and
Mij
came come%2:30:02::
a
knowledge
of
an
obscure
need
,
that
of
being
trusted trust%2:31:00::
implicitly
by
some
creature
.
Two
other
people
in_time
shared share%2:42:00::
Mijbil
's
love
:
``
it
remained remain%2:30:00::
around
us
three
that
his
orb
revolved revolve%2:38:00::
when
he
was be%2:42:03::
not
away
in
his
own
imponderable
world
of
wave
and
water
;
we
were be%2:42:06::
his
Trinity
,
and
he
behaved behave%2:29:00::
towards
us
with
a
mixture
of
trust
and
abuse
,
passion
and
irritation
.
In_turn
each
of
us
in
our
own
way
depended depend%2:42:00::
,
as
gods
do
,
upon
his
worship
''
.
Yet
the
idyll
ended end%2:42:00::
.
The
brief
details
of
Mijbil
's
death
lend lend%2:40:01::
depth
to
the
story
,
give give%2:36:01::
it
an
edge
of
ironic
tragedy

Man
,
to
whom
Mij
gave give%2:40:00::
endless
affection

was be%2:42:03::
responsible

the
form

somehow
becomes become%2:30:00::
an

symbol
of
the
savage
in

But
then
,
through
a
strange
coincidence
,
Maxwell
manages manage%2:41:08::
to
acquire acquire%2:40:00::
Idal
,
a
female
otter
,
and
the
fascinating
story
starts start%2:30:00::
once_more

One
is be%2:42:03::
not
sure
who
emerges emerge%2:30:01::
as
the
main
personality
of_this

Mijbil

traveller

never

it
was be%2:42:03::
first
brought_out bring_out%2:39:00::
in
England
with
a
sense
of
discovery
and
excitement
.
Now
Gavin_Maxwell
's
ring
of
bright
water
has
widened widen%2:30:00::
to
enchant enchant%2:37:00::
the
world
.
The
performances
of
the
Comedie_Francaise
are be%2:42:03::
the_most
important
recent
events
in
the
New_York
theater
.
They
serve serve%2:42:01::
to
contradict contradict%2:42:00::
a
popular
notion
that
the
Comedie
merely
repeats repeat%2:30:00::
,
as
accurately
as
possible
,
the
techniques
of
acting act%2:36:00::
the
classics
that
prevailed prevail%2:42:01::
in
the
17
th
century
.
On_the_contrary
,
the
old
plays
are
continually
being
reinterpreted reinterpret%2:32:00::
,
and
each
new
production
of
a
classic
has have%2:40:01::
only
a
brief
history
at
the
Comedie
.
Of_course
,
the
well-received
revivals
last last%2:42:00::
longer
than
the
others
,
and
that
further
reminds remind%2:32:00::
us
that
the
Comedie
is be%2:42:03::
not
insensitive
to
criticism
.
The
directors
of
the
Comedie
do
not
respond respond%2:31:00::
to
adverse
notices
in
as
docile
and
subservient
a
manner
as
the
Broadway
producers
who
,
in
two
instances
this
season
,
closed close%2:41:00::
their
plays
after
one
performance
.
But
they
are be%2:42:03::
aware_of
the
world
outside
,
they
court court%2:41:01::
public
approval
,
they
delight delight%2:34:00::
in
full
houses
,
and
they
occasionally
dare dare%2:41:00::
to
experiment experiment%2:41:01::
in
interpreting interpret%2:36:00::
a
dramatic
classic
.
In
France
,
novel
approaches
to
the
classic
French
plays
are
frequently
attempted attempt%2:36:00::
.
The
government
pays pay%2:40:02::
a
subsidy
for
revival
of
the
classics
,
and
this
policy
attracts attract%2:35:00::
experimenters
who
sometimes
put put%2:35:05::
Moliere
's
characters
in
modern
dress
and
often
achieve achieve%2:41:00::
interesting
results
.
So_far
as
I
know know%2:31:01::
,
the
Comedie
has
never
put put%2:35:05::
Moliere
's
people
in
the
costumes
of
the
20
th
century
,
but
they
do
reinterpret reinterpret%2:32:00::
plays
and
characters
.
Last
season
,
the
Comedie
's
two
principal
experiments
came come%2:30:01::
to
grief
,
and
,
in
consequence
,
we
can
expect expect%2:31:00::
fairly
soon
to
see see%2:39:02::
still
newer
productions
of
Racine
's
``
Phedre
''
and
Moliere
's
``
School
for
Wives
''
.
The
new
``
Phedre
''
was
done do%2:36:01::
in
17
th
century
setting
,
instead
of
ancient_Greek
;
perhaps
that
is be%2:42:06::
the
Comedie
's
equivalent
for
thrusting thrust%2:38:01::
this
play
's
characters
into
our
own
time
.
The
speaking
of
the
lines
seemed seem%2:39:00::
excessively
slow
and
stately
,
possibly
in
an
effort
to
capture capture%2:36:00::
the
spirit
of
17
th
century
elegance
.
A_few
literary
men
defended defend%2:32:00::
what
they
took_to_be take_to_be%2:31:00::
an
emphasis
on
the
poetry
at
the
expense
of
the
drama
,
but
the
response
was be%2:42:03::
mainly
hostile
and
quite
violent
.
The
new
``
School
for
Wives
''
was
interpreted interpret%2:36:00::
according
to
a
principle
that_is
becoming become%2:30:00::
increasingly
common
in
the
playing
of
classic
comedy
-
the
idea
of
turning turn_into%2:42:00::
some
obviously
ludicrous
figure
into
a
tragic
character
.
Among
the
Moliere
specialists
of
some
years
ago
,
Louis_Jouvet
tried try%2:41:00::
to
humanize humanize%2:37:00::
some
of
the
clowns
,
while
Fernand_Ledoux
,
often
performing perform%2:36:01::
at
the
Comedie
,
made make%2:30:00::
them
more
gross
than
Moliere
may
have
intended intend%2:32:00::
.
Apparently
,
Jouvet
and
Ledoux
attempted attempt%2:36:00::
just
these
dissimilar
approaches
in
the
role
of
Arnolphe
in
``
The
School
for
Wives
''
.
I
say say%2:32:00::
``
apparently
''
although
I
saw see%2:39:03::
Jouvet
as
Arnolphe
when
he
visited visit%2:38:00::
this
country
shortly
before
his
death
;
by
that
time
,
he
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
have
dropped drop%2:30:01::
the
tragic
playing
of
the
last
moments
of
the
comedy
.
Arnolphe
,
it
will
be
recalled recall%2:31:00::
,
is be%2:42:06::
a
man
of
mature
years
who
tries try%2:41:00::
to
preserve preserve%2:42:00::
the
innocence
of
his
youthful
wife-to-be
.
The
part
can
lend lend%2:42:00::
itself
to
serious
treatment
;
one
influential
French
critic
remarked remark%2:32:00::
:
``
Pity
for
Arnolphe
comes_with come_with%2:42:00::
age
''
.
Accordingly
,
at
the
Comedie
last
year
,
Jean_Meyer
played play%2:36:02::
a
sympathetic
Arnolphe
and
drew draw%2:37:01::
criticism
for
turning turn%2:30:04::
the
comedy
into
a
tragedy
.
But
the
stuff
of
tragedy
was be%2:42:03::
not
truly
present
and
the
play
became become%2:42:01::
only
comedy
acted act%2:36:00::
rather
slowly
.
Wisely
,
the
Comedie
has
brought bring%2:38:00::
Moliere
's
``
Tartuffe
''
on
its
tour
and
has_left
``
The
School
for
Wives
''
at_home
.
Tartuffe
is be%2:42:06::
the
religious
hypocrite
who
courts court%2:41:00::
his
benefactor
's
wife
.
Jouvet
played play%2:36:02::
him
as
a
sincere
zealot
,
and
Ledoux
,
at
the
Comedie
,
made make%2:30:00::
him
a
gross
buffoon
,
or_so
the
historians
tell tell%2:32:00::
us
.
Louis_Seigner
,
who
formerly
played play%2:36:02::
the
deluded
benefactor
opposite
Ledoux
,
is be%2:42:06::
the
Tartuffe
of
the
present
production
,
which
he
himself
directed direct%2:36:00::
.
His
Tartuffe
observes observe%2:41:01::
the
golden_mean
.
His
red
face
,
his
coarse
gestures
,
and
his
lustful
stares
bespeak bespeak%2:32:01::
his
sensuality
.
But
his
heavenward
glances
and
his
pious
speeches
are be%2:42:03::
not
merely
perfunctory
;
of_course
,
they
do
not
reflect reflect%2:39:01::
sincerity
,
but
they
exhibit exhibit%2:39:01::
a
concern
to
make make%2:36:00::
a
good
job
out
of
his
pious
impersonation
.
Occasionally
,
Seigner
draws draw%2:37:01::
some
justly
deserved
laughs
by
his
quick
shifts
from
one
personality
to
another
.
The
whole
role
,
by_the_way
,
is be%2:42:03::
a
considerable
transformation
for
anyone
who
has
seen see%2:39:03::
Seigner
in
his
other
parts
.
His
normal
specialty
is be%2:42:06::
playing play%2:36:02::
the
good-natured
old_man
,
frequently
stupid
or
deluded
but
never
mean
or
sly
.
Here
,
he
is be%2:42:06::
,
quite
persuasively
,
the
very
embodiment
of
meanness
and
slyness
.
Seigner
is be%2:41:00::
the
dean
of
the
company
,
the
oldest
actor
in
point
of
continuous
service
.
In_that
function
,
he
helps help%2:41:00::
to
rebut rebut%2:31:00::
another
legend
about
the
Comedie
.
We
are
often
told tell%2:32:00::
that
the
Comedie
has have%2:40:00::
,
unfortunately
,
life-contracts
with
old
actors
who
are be%2:42:03::
both
mediocre
and
lazy
,
drawing draw%2:40:00::
their
pay
without
much
acting
but
probably
doing do%2:41:01::
real
service
to
the
Comedie
by
staying stay%2:30:00::
off_the_stage
.
Seigner
,
however
,
is be%2:42:03::
a
fine
actor
and
probably
the
busiest
man
in
the
company
;
among
his
other
parts
are be%2:42:04::
the
leads
in
``
The
Bourgeois
Gentleman
''
and
``
The
Imaginary_Invalid
''
.
In
Moliere
's
farce
,
``
The
Tricks
of
Scapin
''
,
Robert_Hirsch
undertakes undertake%2:36:00::
another
of
the
great
roles
.
Here
some
innovation
is
attempted attempt%2:36:00::
.
To_begin_with
,
Scapin
is be%2:42:06::
a
trickster
in
the
old
tradition
of
the
clever
servant
who
plots plot%2:31:00::
the
strategy
of
courtship
for
his
master
.
Hirsch
's
Scapin
is be%2:42:03::
healthy
,
cheerful
,
energetic
,
revelling revel%2:34:00::
in
his
physical
agility
and
his
obvious
superiority
to
the
young
gentlemen
whom
he
serves serve%2:41:01::
.
Hirsch
says say%2:32:00::
that
he
has
given give%2:40:03::
the
role
certain
qualities
he
has
observed observe%2:39:02::
in
the
city
toughs
of
the
real_world
.
And
surely
his
Scapin
has have%2:42:00::
a
fresh
directness
,
a
no-nonsense
quality
that
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
make make%2:30:00::
him
his
own
master
and
nobody
's
servant
.
