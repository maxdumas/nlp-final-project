America

Incapable_of
self-delusion
,
the
Founding
Fathers
found find%2:39:01::
the
crisis
of
their
time
to
be be%2:42:03::
equally
grave
,
and

they

Seven
Founders

George_Washington

Benjamin_Franklin

John_Adams

Thomas_Jefferson

Alexander_Hamilton

James_Madison

John_Jay
-
determined determine%2:31:02::
the
destinies
of
the
new
nation

In
certain
respects
,
their
task
was be%2:42:03::
incomparably
greater
than
ours
today
,
for
there
was be%2:42:00::
nobody
before
them
to
show show%2:32:01::
them
the
way
.
As
Madison
commented comment%2:32:00::
to
Jefferson
in
1789
,
``
We
are be%2:42:05::
in
a
wilderness
without

footstep
to
guide guide%2:38:00::
us
.
Our
successors
will
have have%2:40:00::
an

They
thought_of think_of%2:31:01::
themselves

Jefferson
's
words
,
as
``
the
Argonauts
''
who
had
lived live%2:42:00::
in

the
Heroic_Age

Accordingly
,
they
took take_pains%2:41:00::
special
pains
to
preserve preserve%2:40:01::
their
papers
as
essential
sources
for
posterity
.
Their
writings
assume assume%2:30:00::
more_than
dramatic
or
patriotic
interest
because
of
their
conviction
that
the
struggle
in_which
they
were
involved involve%2:42:04::
was be%2:42:03::
neither
selfish
nor
parochial
but
,
rather
,
as
Washington
in
his
last
wartime
circular
reminded remind%2:32:00::
his
fellow
countrymen
,
that
``
with
our
fate
will
the
destiny
of

millions
be
involved involve%2:42:01::

Strong
men
with
strong
opinions
,
frank
to_the_point
of
being be%2:42:03::
refreshingly
indiscreet
,
the
Founding
Seven
were be%2:42:03::
essentially
congenial
minds
,
and
their
agreements
with
each
other
were be%2:42:03::
more
consequential
than
their
differences
.
Even_though
in
most
cases
the
completion
of
the
definitive
