What

If

,
we
are
confronted confront%2:32:03::
with
two two%5:00:00:cardinal:00
problems problem%1:10:00::
.
First first%4:02:00::
,
T
may
not not%4:02:00::
have have%2:42:00::
a
single single%3:00:00::
characteristic characteristic%3:00:00::
value value%1:09:00::
;
this
is be%2:42:06::
really really%4:02:03::
a
deficiency deficiency%1:26:00::
in
the
scalar_field scalar_field%1:14:00::
,
namely namely%4:02:00::
,
that
it
is be%2:42:03::
not not%4:02:00::
algebraically algebraically%4:02:00::
closed closed%3:00:02::
.
Second second%4:02:00::
,
even even%4:02:00::
if
the
characteristic characteristic%3:00:00::
polynomial polynomial%1:09:00::
factors factor%2:31:00::
completely completely%4:02:03::
over
F
into
a
product product%1:09:00::
of
polynomials polynomial%1:09:00::
of
degree degree%1:09:00::
1 1%1:23:00::
,
there
may
not not%4:02:00::
be be%2:42:00::
enough enough%5:00:00:sufficient:00
characteristic characteristic%3:00:00::
vectors vector%1:09:00::
for
T
to
span span%2:42:00::
the
space space%1:14:00::
V
;
this
is be%2:42:02::
clearly clearly%4:02:00::
a
deficiency deficiency%1:26:00::
in
T
.
The
second second%5:00:00:intermediate:00
situation situation%1:26:00::
is
illustrated illustrate%2:32:00::
by
the
operator operator%1:24:00::
T
on

f

F

The
characteristic characteristic%3:00:00::
polynomial polynomial%1:09:00::
for
A
is be%2:42:06::
*
*
f
and
this
is be%2:42:06::
plainly plainly%4:02:00::
also also%4:02:00::
the
minimal minimal%3:00:00::
polynomial polynomial%1:09:00::
for
A
(
or
for
T
)
.
Thus thus%4:02:00::
T
is be%2:42:03::
not not%4:02:00::
diagonalizable diagonalizable%3:01:00::
.
One
sees see%2:31:01::
that
this
happens happen%2:30:02::
because
the
null_space null_space%1:14:00::
of
*
*
f
has have%2:42:00::
dimension dimension%1:07:00::

On_the_other_hand on_the_other_hand%4:02:00::

the
null_space null_space%1:14:00::
of

f
and
the
null_space null_space%1:14:00::

f
together together%4:02:04::
span span%2:42:00::
V

If

The

If

The

For

Since

Thus thus%4:02:00::
there

Note note%2:39:00::
also also%4:02:00::
that

We

Let let%2:41:00::

f

Since

f

we
have have%2:40:00::

f

Thus thus%4:02:00::
the

projections projection%1:09:01::
which

to

direct_sum
decomposition decomposition%1:09:00::

We
wish wish%2:31:00::
to
show show%2:31:00::
that
the

exactly exactly%4:02:01::
the

It
is
clear clear%3:00:00::
that
each each%5:00:00:all(a):00

in

for
if

then then%4:02:02::
*

f
and
so

f
because

f
is be%2:42:03::
divisible_by divisible_by%5:00:00:divisible:00
the

Conversely conversely%4:02:00::
,
suppose suppose%2:32:00::
that

If

f
is be%2:42:03::
divisible_by divisible_by%5:00:00:divisible:00

f
and
so

f
,
i.e. i.e.%4:02:00::
,
*

f
.
But
then then%4:02:02::
it
is be%2:42:03::
immediate immediate%5:00:00:present(a):01
that

f
,
i.e. i.e.%4:02:00::
,
that
|a
is be%2:42:05::
in
the
range range%1:15:03::

This
completes complete%2:30:02::
the
proof proof%1:10:00::
of

(
a

.
It
is be%2:42:03::
certainly certainly%4:02:00::
clear clear%3:00:00::
that

If

f
is be%2:42:06::
the
operator operator%1:24:00::
induced induce%2:36:00::

then then%4:02:02::
evidently evidently%4:02:00::

f

because
by

f
is be%2:42:07::
0 0%1:23:00::

This
shows show%2:31:00::
that
the
minimal minimal%3:00:00::

f
divides divide%2:31:00::

f

Conversely conversely%4:02:00::
,
let let%2:41:00::
g
be be%2:42:06::
any
polynomial polynomial%1:09:00::
such_that such_that%5:00:00:specified:00

Then then%4:02:02::
*
*
f
.
Thus thus%4:02:00::
*
*
f
is be%2:42:03::
divisible_by divisible_by%5:00:00:divisible:00
the
minimal minimal%3:00:00::

p
of

i.e. i.e.%4:02:00::
,
*
*
f
divides divide%2:31:00::

It
is
easily easily%4:02:01::
seen see%2:31:01::
that

f
divides divide%2:31:00::
g
.
Hence hence%4:02:00::
the
minimal minimal%3:00:00::

for

When

f
for

we
shall
have have%2:40:00::

f

because
the

be be%2:42:07::

Let
N
be be%2:42:06::
a
linear_operator linear_operator%1:24:00::
on
the

We
say say%2:32:01::
that
N
is be%2:42:03::
nilpotent nilpotent%3:01:00::
if
there

Let let%2:41:00::
T
be be%2:42:06::
a
linear_operator linear_operator%1:24:00::
on

Suppose suppose%2:32:00::
that
the

decomposes decompose%2:30:00::
over

into
a

Then then%4:02:02::
there
is be%2:42:00::
a
diagonalizable diagonalizable%3:01:00::
operator operator%1:24:00::
D
on

The

D
and
the

uniquely uniquely%4:02:00::
determined determine%2:31:01::
by
(

and
(

and
each
of
them
is be%2:42:06::
a
polynomial polynomial%1:09:00::
in

We
have
just just%4:02:01::
observed observe%2:39:02::
that
we
can
write write%2:36:00::
*
*
f
where
D
is be%2:42:03::
diagonalizable diagonalizable%3:01:00::
and
N

and
where
D

not_only not_only%4:02:00::
commute commute%2:30:04::
but
are be%2:42:06::
polynomials polynomial%1:09:00::
in

Now now%4:02:04::
suppose suppose%2:32:00::
that
we
also also%4:02:00::
have have%2:40:00::
*
*
f
where
D
'
is be%2:42:03::
diagonalizable diagonalizable%3:01:00::
,
N
'
is be%2:42:03::
nilpotent nilpotent%3:01:00::
,
and
*
*
f
.
We
shall
prove prove%2:31:02::
that
*
*
f
.
Since
D
'
and
N
'
commute commute%2:30:04::
with
one
another
and
*
*
f
,
we
see see%2:31:01::
that
D
'
and
N
'
commute commute%2:30:04::
with
T
.
Thus thus%4:02:00::
D
'
and
N
'
commute commute%2:30:04::
with
any
polynomial polynomial%1:09:00::
in
T
;
hence hence%4:02:00::
they
commute commute%2:30:04::
with
D
and
with
N
.
Now now%4:02:00::
we
have have%2:40:00::
*
*
f
or
*
*
f
and
all all%3:00:00::
four four%5:00:00:cardinal:00
of
these
operators operator%1:24:00::
commute commute%2:30:04::
with
one

.
Since
D
and
D
'
are be%2:42:03::
both
diagonalizable diagonalizable%3:01:00::

they
commute commute%2:30:04::
,
they
are be%2:42:03::
simultaneously simultaneously%4:02:00::
diagonalizable diagonalizable%3:01:00::

and
*
*
f
is be%2:42:03::
diagonalizable diagonalizable%3:01:00::

Since
N
and
N
'
are be%2:42:03::
both
nilpotent nilpotent%3:01:00::

they
commute commute%2:30:04::
,
the
operator operator%1:24:00::
*
*
f
is be%2:42:03::
nilpotent nilpotent%3:01:00::
;
for
,
using use%2:34:01::
the
fact fact%1:10:01::
that
N

commute commute%2:30:04::
*
*
f
and
so
when
r
is be%2:42:03::
sufficiently sufficiently%4:02:00::
large large%3:00:00::
every
term term%1:09:00::
in
this
expression expression%1:10:03::
for
*
*
f
will
be be%2:42:07::
0 0%1:23:00::
.
(
Actually actually%4:02:00::
,
a
nilpotent nilpotent%3:01:00::
operator operator%1:24:00::
on
an
n-dimensional
space space%1:14:00::
must
have have%2:40:00::
its
nth

0 0%1:23:00::
;
if
we
take take%2:31:03::
*

f
above above%4:02:00::
,
that
will
be be%2:42:03::
large large%3:00:00::
enough enough%5:00:00:sufficient:00
.
It
then then%4:02:02::
follows follow%2:42:05::
that
*
*
f
is be%2:42:03::
large large%3:00:00::
enough enough%5:00:00:sufficient:00
,
but
this
is be%2:42:03::
not not%4:02:00::
obvious obvious%3:00:00::
from
the
above above%5:00:00:preceding(a):00
expression expression%1:10:03::

)
Now now%4:02:00::
*
*
f
is be%2:42:03::
a
diagonalizable diagonalizable%3:01:00::
operator operator%1:24:00::
which
is be%2:42:03::
also also%4:02:00::
nilpotent nilpotent%3:01:00::
.
Such such%5:00:01:specified:00
an
operator operator%1:24:00::
is be%2:42:06::
obviously obviously%4:02:00::
the
zero zero%1:23:02::
operator operator%1:24:00::
;
for
since
it
is be%2:42:03::
nilpotent nilpotent%3:01:00::
,
the
minimal minimal%3:00:00::
polynomial polynomial%1:09:00::
for
this
operator operator%1:24:00::
is be%2:42:03::
of
the
form form%1:09:01::
*
*
f
for
some some%5:00:00:unspecified:00
*
*
f
;
but
then then%4:02:02::
since
the
operator operator%1:24:00::
is be%2:42:03::
diagonalizable diagonalizable%3:01:00::
,
the
minimal minimal%3:00:00::
polynomial polynomial%1:09:00::
cannot
have have%2:40:00::
a
repeated repeated%5:00:00:continual:00
root root%1:23:00::
;
hence hence%4:02:00::
*
*
f
and
the
minimal minimal%3:00:00::
polynomial polynomial%1:09:00::
is be%2:42:06::
simply simply%4:02:00::
x
,
which
says say%2:32:01::
the
operator operator%1:24:00::
is be%2:42:07::
0 0%1:23:00::

Thus thus%4:02:00::
we
see see%2:31:01::
that

f
and

f

Let let%2:41:00::

e.g. e.g.%4:02:00::
,
the
field field%1:14:00::

Then then%4:02:02::
every every%5:00:02:all(a):00

can
be
written write%2:36:00::

From
these

one
