You
can
build build%2:36:00::
this
vacation
cottage
yourself
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
a
full
scale
,
small
,
but
efficient
house
that
can
become become%2:42:01::
a
year
'
round
retreat
complete
in
every
detail
.
Because
of
the
unique
design
by
the
architect
Egils_Hermanovski
,
you
can
build build%2:36:00::
most_of
it
in
your
own
home
workshop
in
your
spare_time
.
Most_of
it
is be%2:42:03::
panelized
and
utilizes utilize%2:34:00::
standard
materials
,
and
requires require%2:42:00::
the
use
of
only
simple
tools
.
On
the
following
pages
and
in
the
following
issues
we
take take%2:38:09::
you
every
step
of
the
way
to
your
vacation
cottage
,
from
choosing choose%2:31:00::
the
proper
site
to
applying apply%2:35:00::
the
final
trim
.
In
recognition
of
the
growing
trend
for
second
homes
,
or
vacation
cottages
,
we
have
designed design%2:36:01::
this
one
specifically
with
the
family
handyman
in
mind
.
It
is be%2:42:06::
a
big
project
,
not
to
be
taken take%2:31:07::
lightly
.
But
each
step
has
been
broken_down break_down%2:31:00::
into
easy
stages
,
utilizing utilize%2:34:00::
standard
materials
and
simple
tools
,
well
within
the
capabilities
of
the
handyman
.
The
idea
behind
our
design
is be%2:42:06::
modular
units
,
or
panelization
.
Everything
possible
has
been
scaled scale%2:36:00::
to
standard
sizes
and
measurements
of
materials
.
Wall
panels
and
structural
timbers
are be%2:42:03::
standard
as
are be%2:42:03::
windows
and
doors
,
making_for make_for%2:36:00::
a
minimum
of
cutting
.
We
have
developed develop%2:36:00::
an
ingenious
method
of
interlocking interlock%2:30:00::
these
so_that
you
can
make make%2:36:00::
the
major
part
of
your
house
in
your
own
workshop
,
panel
by
panel
,
according
to
plan
.
Thus
,
when
you
have
prepared prepare%2:30:00::
your
foundation
and
laid lay%2:35:01::
the
floor
,
these
can
be
trucked truck%2:38:00::
to
the
site
and
erected erect%2:36:00::
with
a
small
crew
of
friends
in
a
weekend
.
The
roof
timbers
are be%2:42:03::
precut
and
the
panels
standard
so_that
the
house
can
be
completely
enclosed enclose%2:35:01::
in
a
matter
of
three
or
four
days
.
Then
you
can
do do%2:36:01::
the
finishing
touches
at
your
leisure
.
Due_to
the
fact
that
building_codes
and
regulations
vary vary%2:42:00::
so_much
throughout
the
country
,
the
first
thing
to
do do%2:41:01::
is be%2:42:06::
to
find_out find_out%2:32:00::
what
,
if
any
,
they
are be%2:42:06::
.
Close_to
a
large
city
they
might
even
specify specify%2:42:00::
the
size
of
the
nails
used use%2:34:01::
;
in
a
remote
section
there
might
be be%2:42:00::

This
can
usually
be be%2:42:03::
found_out find_out%2:32:00::
at

At_the_same_time
check check%2:31:00::

sanitary
requirements

possible
zoning
regulations

Whether
electricity

are be%2:42:03::
available

the
local
customs
in
the
use
of

Be be%2:42:03::
sure
that
this
information
is be%2:42:03::
reasonably
official
and
not
just

unfounded
opinion
.
If
there
are be%2:42:00::
any
major

,
they
usually
can
be
obtained obtain%2:40:00::
in

Where
a

find_out find_out%2:32:00::
what
you
must
present present%2:32:00::
when

for

In
many
cases
,
you
must
file file%2:32:02::
a
complete
set
of

with
the
local
building
inspector
.
These
will
be be%2:42:03::

With
modern
techniques
of
woodworking
and
the
multitude

the
drill

and
a

.
There
is be%2:42:00::
often
a

locking lock%2:35:00::
the
quill
and
,
on
larger
presses
,
the
table
can
be
tilted tilt%2:38:00::
.
The
size
of
the
press
is
usually
expressed express%2:32:01::
in_terms_of
chuck
capacity
(
the
maximum
diameter
tool
shank
it
will
hold hold%2:42:14::
)
or
distance
between
the
spindle
center
and
the
column
.
A
press
with
an
11
inch
capacity
lets let%2:41:00::
you
drill drill%2:35:00::
to
the
center
of
a
22
inch
board
or
circle
.
A
new
radial
drill
press
with
a
16
inch
capacity
has have%2:42:00::
a
tilting tilt%2:38:00::
head
that
allows allow%2:41:00::
drilling
to
be
done do%2:41:01::
at

The
head
is
mounted mount%2:35:00::
on

horizontal
arm
that
swivels swivel%2:38:00::
on
the
supporting
column
to
position position%2:38:00::
the
drill_bit
instead
of
the
work
.
The
drill
press
should
be
leveled level%2:36:00::
and
,
depending_on
whether
it
is be%2:42:03::
a
bench
or
floor
model

bolted bolt%2:35:00::
securely

This
will
reduce reduce%2:30:00::

increase increase%2:30:00::
accuracy
.
A
coat
of
paste
wax
or
a
rubdown
with
a_piece
of
wax_paper
will
protect protect%2:33:00::
the
polished
surface

table
;
wiping wipe%2:35:00::
with
a
slightly

cloth
will
discourage discourage%2:32:01::
rusting rust%2:30:00::
of

Presses
not

with
sealed
spindle
bearings
will
need need%2:42:00::
a
drop
of
oil
now_and_then
in
the
lubrication
holes
in
the
quill
.
The
rest
of
the
press
should
be
kept keep%2:42:00::
clean
by
dusting dust%2:35:00::
with
a
clean
rag
or
brush
.
Be be%2:42:03::
careful
to
keep keep%2:42:00::
the
drive
belt
free_of
oil
and
grease
.
Belt
tension
is
adjusted adjust%2:30:00::
by
manipulation
of
two
locking
bolts
and
a
movable
motor
mount
.
Keep keep%2:42:00::
the
belt
just
tight
enough
so
the
pulleys
won
n't
slip slip%2:38:05::
when
pulled pull%2:35:00::
by_hand
;
excess
tension
will
only
cause cause%2:36:00::
undue
wear
on
the
motor
and
spindle
bearings
.
Most
drill
presses
have have%2:42:00::
a
quill

spring
that
raises raise%2:38:00::
the
spindle

when
the
feed

holds hold%2:42:00::
the
quill
in

raised
position
.
The
return
spring
tension
may
be
adjusted adjust%2:30:00::
to
suit suit%2:42:05::
individual
requirements
by
gripping grip%2:35:00::
the
spring
housing
with
a

of
pliers
(
to

rotating rotate%2:38:01::
the
housing
until
the
desired

Turning turn%2:38:00::
the
housing
clockwise
will
reduce reduce%2:30:00::
tension
,
counter-clockwise
will
increase increase%2:30:00::
it
.
Some
manufacturers
have
had have%2:40:00::
the
foresight
to
provide provide%2:40:00::
a
socket
for
the
chuck
key
;
otherwise
,
you
'll
have_to
spend spend%2:42:00::
a_few
minutes
to
either
attach attach%2:35:01::
a
suitable
spring
clip
somewhere
on
the
press
head
or
fit fit%2:30:01::
the
key
to
a
length
of
light
chain
and
fasten fasten%2:35:00::
to
the
bottom
of
the
motor
mount
so_that
the
key
is be%2:42:03::
out_of_the_way
when
not
in_use
.
Drill
speeds
are be%2:42:03::
important
if
you
want want%2:37:00::
a
good
job
.
Each
cutting_tool
will
operate operate%2:41:00::
best
at
a
given
speed
,
depending_on
the
material
worked work%2:41:00::
.
On
most
drill
presses
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
impossible
to
get get%2:40:00::
the
exact
speed
,
but
you
can
come come%2:30:02::
close_by
adjusting adjust%2:30:00::
the
drive
belt
on
the
step-cone
pulleys
.
You
will
find find%2:39:02::
a
chart
giving give%2:40:05::
the
various
speed
ratios
available
with
your
particular
drill
press
somewhere
in
the
instruction
booklet
that
came_with come_with%2:42:00::
the
tool
.
See see%2:39:00::
the
table
on
page
34
for
exact
recommended
speeds
.
Generally
,
the
larger
the
tool
and
the
harder
the
material
,
the
slower
the
speed
.
Feed
pressure
is be%2:42:03::
also
of
major
importance
.
Too_much
pressure
will
force force%2:38:00::
the
tool
beyond
its
cutting
capacity
and
result result%2:42:02::
in
rough
cuts
and
jammed
or
broken
tools
.
Too
light
a
feed
,
particularly
with
metal
or
other
hard
material
,
causes cause%2:36:00::
overheating
of
the
tool
and
burning
of
the
cutting_edge
.
The
best
results
will
be
obtained obtain%2:40:00::
by
matching match%2:42:00::
the
correct
speed
with
a
steady
feed
pressure
that
lets let%2:41:00::
the
tool
cut cut%2:35:00::
easily
at
an
even
rate
.
There
are be%2:42:00::
numerous
types
and
styles
of
tools
to
drill drill%2:35:00::
holes
.
The_most
common
are be%2:42:06::
the
twist_drill
,
the
solid
center
shaft
with
interchangeable
cutting
blades
,
the
double
spur
bit
,
and
the
power
wood
bit
.
All
will
do do%2:36:01::
a
good
job
if
sharp
,
but
the
twist_drills
do
n't
cut cut%2:35:00::
quite
as
smoothly
as
the
others
,
since
they
do
not
have have%2:42:00::
the
outlining
spurs
that
sever sever%2:35:01::
the
fibers
before
actual
boring
starts start%2:30:00::
.
The
adjustable
fly
cutter
is be%2:42:03::
very
useful
for
cutting cut%2:35:00::
large
diameter
holes
and
can
be
used use%2:34:01::
to
cut cut%2:35:00::
exact-size
discs
by
reversing reverse%2:30:01::
the
cutter
blade
.
Since
fly
cutters
are be%2:42:03::
one
sided
and
not
balanced
,
they

When

all_the_way

,
always
place place%2:35:00::
a_piece

This
will
not_only

a

Another

a

hole
is be%2:42:02::
to
first
drill drill%2:35:00::
a

hole
all_the_way
through
,
then
drill drill%2:35:00::
half_way

turn turn%2:38:00::

In
soft

grain
,
there
is be%2:42:00::
sometimes
a
tendency
for
the
hole
to

,
due_to
the
varying

In_this
case
,
drilling drill%2:35:00::
a
small
pilot
hole
or
clamping clamp%2:35:00::
the
work
will
do do%2:41:01::
much

When
a
hole
is be%2:42:03::
to
be
bored bore%2:35:00::
to
a
predetermined
depth
,
mark mark%2:35:09::
the
depth
on_the_side

the
stock
,
then
run run%2:41:02::
the
bit
down

The

can
now
be
