The
North
and
the
South
were be%2:42:03::
in
greater
agreement
on
sovereignty
,
through
all
their
dispute
about
it
,
than
were be%2:42:03::
the
Founding
Fathers
.
The
truth
in
their
conflicting
concepts
was
expounded expound%2:32:00::
by
statesmen
of
the
calibre
of
Webster
and
Calhoun
,
and
defended defend%2:32:00::
in_the_end
by
leaders
of
the
nobility
of
Lincoln
and
Lee
.
The
people
everywhere
had
grown grow%2:30:00::
meanwhile
in
devotion
to
basic
democratic
principles
,
in
understanding
of
and
belief
in
the
federal
balance
,
and
in_love
of
their
Union
.
Repeated
efforts
-
beginning_with
the
Missouri_Compromise
of
1821
-
were
made make%2:41:00::
by
such
master
moderates
as
Clay
and
Douglas
to
resolve resolve%2:31:01::
the
difference
peacefully
by
compromise
,
rather_than
clear
thought
and
timely
action
.
Even_so
,
confusion
in_this
period
gained gain%2:40:03::
such
strength
(
from
compromise
and
other
factors
)
that
it
led lead%2:42:12::
to
the
bloodiest
war
of
the
Nineteenth
century
.
Nothing
can
show show%2:31:00::
more_than
this
the
immensity
of
the
danger
to
democratic
peoples
that
lies_in lie_in%2:42:00::
even
relatively
slight
deviation
from
their
true
concept
of
sovereignty
.
The
present
issue
in
Atlantica
-
whether
to
transform transform%2:30:00::
an
alliance
of
sovereign
nations
into
a
federal
union
of
sovereign
citizens
-
resembles resemble%2:42:00::
the
American
one
of
1787
-
89
rather_than
the
one
that
was
resolved resolve%2:31:01::
by
Civil_War
.
And
so
I
would
only
touch touch_on%2:42:00::
upon
it
now
(
much_as
I
have
long
wanted
to
write write%2:36:02::
a
book
about
it
)
.
I
think think%2:31:01::
it
is be%2:42:03::
essential
,
however
,
to
pinpoint pinpoint%2:40:00::
here
the
difference
between
the
two
concepts
of
sovereignty
that
went_to_war go_to_war%2:33:00::
in
1861
-
if
only
to
see see%2:31:01::
better
how
imperative
is be%2:42:03::
our
need
today
to
clarify clarify%2:31:00::
completely
our
far
worse
confusion
on
this
subject
.
The
difference
came_down come_down%2:30:00::
to
this
:
The
Southern
States
insisted insist%2:32:00::
that
the
United_States
was be%2:42:06::
,
in
last
analysis
,
what
its
name
implied imply%2:32:01::
-
a
Union
of
States
.
To
their
leaders
the
Constitution
was be%2:42:06::
a
compact
made make%2:36:00::
by
the
people
of
sovereign
states
,
who
therefore
retained retain%2:40:01::
the
right
to
secede secede%2:41:00::
from_it
.
This
right
of
the
State
,
its
upholders
contended contend%2:32:02::
,
was be%2:42:03::
essential
to
maintain maintain%2:42:00::
the
federal
balance
and
protect protect%2:33:00::
the
liberty
of
the
people
from
the
danger
of
centralizing centralize%2:30:00::
power
in
the
Union
government
.
The
champions
of
the
Union
maintained maintain%2:32:00::
that
the
Constitution
had
formed form%2:36:00::
,
fundamentally
,
the
united
people
of
America
,
that
it
was be%2:42:06::
a
compact
among
sovereign
citizens
rather_than
states
,
and
that
therefore
the
states
had have%2:40:00::
no
right
to
secede secede%2:41:00::
,
though
the
citizens
could
.
Writing write%2:32:08::
to
Speed
on
August
24
,
1855
,
Lincoln
made make%2:30:00::
the
latter
point
clear
.
In
homely
terms
whose
timeliness
is be%2:42:03::
startling
today
,
he
thus
declared declare%2:32:00::
his
own
right
to
secede secede%2:41:00::
.
``
We
began begin%2:30:00::
by
declaring declare%2:32:05::
that
all
men
are be%2:42:03::
created create%2:36:02::
equal
.
We
now
practically
read read%2:31:09::
it
,
all
men
are be%2:42:03::
created create%2:36:02::

When
the
Know-nothings
get get%2:40:00::
control
,
it
will
read read%2:42:00::
,
All
men

to
this
,
I
shall
prefer prefer%2:31:00::

to
some

they
make make%2:36:00::
no

where

base

''
.
[
His
emphasis
]
When
the
Southern
States
exercised exercise%2:34:00::
their
``
right
to
secede secede%2:41:00::
''
,
they
formed form%2:41:00::
what
they
officially
styled style%2:32:00::
``
The
Confederate_States_of_America
''
.
Dictionaries
,
as
we
have
seen see%2:39:00::
,
still
cite cite%2:32:00::
this
government
,
along
with
the
Articles
of
Confederation
of
1781
,
as
an
example
of
a
confederacy
.
The
fact
is be%2:42:06::
that
the
Southern_Confederacy
differed differ%2:42:00::
from
the
earlier
one
almost
as
much_as
the
Federal_Constitution
did
.
The
Confederate_Constitution
copied copy%2:36:00::
much
of
the
Federal_Constitution
verbatim
,
and
most_of
the
rest
in
substance
.
It
operated operate%2:41:00::
on
,
by
and
for
the
people
individually
just_as
did
the
Federal_Constitution
.
It
made make%2:36:00::
substantially
the
same
division
of
power
between
the
central
and
state_governments
,
and
among
the
executive
,
legislative
and
judicial
branches
.
Many
believe believe%2:31:00::
-
and
understandably
-
that
the
great
difference
between
the
Constitution
of
the
Southern_Confederacy
and
the
Federal_Constitution
was be%2:42:06::
that
the
former
recognized recognize%2:31:02::
the
right
of
each
state
to
secede secede%2:41:00::
.
But
though
each
of
its
members
had
asserted assert%2:32:01::
this
right
against
the
Union
,
the
final
Constitution
which
the
Confederacy
signed sign%2:41:00::
on
March
11
-
nearly
a
month
before
hostilities
began begin%2:30:00::
-
included include%2:42:00::
no
explicit
provision
authorizing authorize%2:32:00::
a
state
to
secede secede%2:41:00::
.
Its
drafters
discussed discuss%2:32:00::
this
vital
point
but
left leave_out%2:31:01::
it
out
of
their
Constitution
.
Their
President
,
Jefferson_Davis
,
interpreted interpret%2:32:00::
their
Constitution
to
mean mean%2:32:01::
that
it
``
admits admit%2:40:00::
of
no
coerced
association
''
,
but
this
remained remain%2:30:00::
so
doubtful
that
``
there
were be%2:42:04::
frequent
demands
that
the
right
to
secede secede%2:41:00::
be
put put%2:35:00::
into
the
Constitution
''
.
The
Constitution
of
the
Southern
``
Confederation
''
differed differ%2:42:00::
from_that
of
the
Federal_Union
only
in
two
important
respects
:
It
openly
,
defiantly
,
recognized recognize%2:31:02::
slavery
-
an
institution
which
the
Southerners
of
1787
,
even_though
they
continued continue%2:42:00::
it
,
found find%2:31:10::
so
impossible
to
reconcile reconcile%2:30:01::
with
freedom
that
they
carefully
avoided avoid%2:41:03::
mentioning mention%2:32:02::
the
word
in
the
Federal_Constitution
.
They
recognized recognize%2:31:01::
that
slavery
was be%2:42:06::
a
moral
issue
and
not
merely
an
economic
interest
,
and
that
to
recognize recognize%2:31:02::
it
explicitly
in
their
Constitution
would
be be%2:42:03::
in
explosive
contradiction
to
the
concept
of
sovereignty
they
had
set_forth set_forth%2:32:00::
in
the
Declaration
of
1776
that
``
all
men
are
created create%2:36:02::
equal
,
that
they
are
endowed endow%2:41:00::
by
their
Creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
,
that
among
them
are be%2:42:05::
life
,
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
''
.
The
other
important
difference
between
the
two
Constitutions
was be%2:42:06::
that
the
President
of
the
Confederacy
held hold%2:40:04::
office
for
six
(
instead
of
four
)
years
,
and
was be%2:42:03::
limited
to
one
term
.
These
are be%2:42:03::
not
,
however
,
differences
in
federal
structure
.
The
only
important
differences
from_that
standpoint
,
between
the
two
Constitutions
,
lies_in lie_in%2:42:00::
their
Preambles
.
The
one
of
1861
made make%2:30:00::
clear
that
in
making make%2:36:00::
their
government
the
people
were
acting act%2:33:00::;2:41:00::
through
their
states
,
whereas
the
Preamble
of
1787
-
89
expressed express%2:32:02::
,
as
clearly
as
language
can
,
the
opposite
concept
,
that
they
were
acting act%2:33:00::;2:41:00::
directly
as
citizens
.
Here
are be%2:42:05::
the
two
Preambles
:
``

People

''
.
One
is
tempted tempt%2:32:01::
to
say say%2:32:00::
that
,
on
the
difference
between
the
concepts
of
sovereignty
in
these
two
preambles
,
the
worst
war
of
the
Nineteenth
century
was
fought fight%2:33:00::
.
But
though
the
Southern
States
,
when
drafting draft%2:36:00::
a
constitution
to
unite unite%2:30:00::
themselves
,
narrowed narrow%2:31:00::
the
difference
to
this
fine
point
by
omitting omit%2:31:01::
to
assert assert%2:32:01::
the
right
to
secede secede%2:41:00::
,
the
fact
remained remain%2:42:05::
that
by
seceding secede%2:41:00::
from
the
Union
they
had
already
acted_on act_on%2:41:01::
the
concept
that
it
was
composed compose%2:42:00::
primarily
of
sovereign
states
.
If
the
Union
conceded concede%2:40:00::
this
to
them
,
the
same
right
must
be
conceded concede%2:40:00::
to
each
remaining
state
whenever
it
saw see%2:31:00::
fit
to
secede secede%2:41:00::
:
This
would
destroy destroy%2:36:00::
the
federal
balance
between
it
and
the
states
,
and
in_the_end
sacrifice sacrifice%2:40:00::
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
all
the
liberty
the
citizens
had
gained gain%2:40:03::
by
their
Union
.
Lincoln
saw see%2:31:01::
that
the
act
of
secession
made make%2:30:00::
the
issue
for
the
Union
a
vital
one
:
Whether
it
was be%2:42:06::
a
Union
of
sovereign
citizens
that
should
continue continue%2:42:01::
to
live live%2:42:04::
,
or
an
association
of
sovereign
states
that
must
fall fall%2:30:08::
prey
either
to
``
anarchy
or
despotism
''
.
Much_as
he
abhorred abhor%2:37:00::
slavery
,
Lincoln
was be%2:42:03::
always
willing
to
concede concede%2:40:00::
to
each
``
slave_state
''
the
right
to
decide decide%2:31:00::
independently
whether
to
continue continue%2:42:00::
or
end end%2:30:01::
it
.
Though
his
election
was
interpreted interpret%2:31:00::
by
many
Southerners
as
the
forerunner
of
a
dangerous
shift
in
the
federal
balance
in
favor
of
the
Union
,
Lincoln
himself
proposed propose%2:32:00::
no
such
change
in
the
rights
the
Constitution
gave give%2:40:00::
the
states
.
After
the
war
began begin%2:30:00::
,
he
long
refused refuse%2:32:00::
to
permit permit%2:32:00::
emancipation
of
the
slaves
by
Union
action
even
in
the
Border
States
that
stayed stay%2:30:00::
with
the
Union
.
He
issued issue%2:32:01::
his
Emancipation_Proclamation
only
when
he
felt feel%2:31:00::
that
necessity
left leave%2:42:01::
him
no
other
way
to
save save%2:41:01::
the
Union
.
In
his
Message
of
December
2
,
1862
,
he
put put%2:32:00::
his
purpose
and
his
policy
in
these
words
-
which
I
would
call call%2:32:02::
the
Lincoln_Law
of
Liberty-and-Union
:
``
In
giving give%2:40:00::
freedom
to
the
slave
,
we
assure assure%2:32:03::
freedom
to
the
free
''
.
What
Lincoln
could
not
concede concede%2:32:01::
was be%2:42:06::
that
the
states
rather_than
the
people
were be%2:42:03::
sovereign
in
the
Union
.
He
fought fight%2:33:00::
to
the
end
to
preserve preserve%2:42:00::
it
as
a
``
government
of
the
people
,
by
the
people
,
for
the
people
''
.
The
fact
that
the
Americans
who
upheld uphold%2:32:00::
the
sovereignty
of
their
states
did do%2:41:01::
this
in_order_to
keep keep%2:42:00::
many_of
their
people
more
securely
in
slavery
-
the
antithesis
of
individual
liberty
-
made make%2:30:00::
the
conflict
grimmer
,
and
the
greater
.
Out
of_this
ordeal
the
citizen
emerged emerge%2:30:02::
,
in
the
South
as
in_the_North
,
as
America
's
true
sovereign
,
in
``
a
new
birth
of
freedom
''
,
as
Lincoln
promised promise%2:32:00::
.
But
before_this
came_about come_about%2:30:00::
,
214938
Americans
had
given give%2:40:10::
their
lives
in
battle
for
the
two
concepts
of
the
sovereign
rights
of
men
and
of
states
.
On
their
decisive
battlefield
Lincoln
did
not
distinguish distinguish%2:31:00::
between
them
when
he
paid pay%2:32:00::
tribute
to
the
``
brave
men
,
living
and
dead
,
who
fought fight%2:33:00::
here
''
.
He
understood understand%2:31:01::
that
both
sides
were be%2:42:03::
at_fault
,
and
he
reached reach%2:38:00::
the
height
of
saying say%2:32:00::
so
explicitly
in
his
Second
Inaugural
.
To
my
knowledge
,
Lincoln
remains remain%2:42:05::
the
only
Head_of_State
and
Commander-in-Chief
who
,
while
fighting fight%2:33:00::
a
fearful
war
whose
issue
was be%2:42:03::
in
doubt
,
proved prove%2:42:00::
man
enough
to
say say%2:32:00::
this
publicly
-
to
give give%2:40:03::
his
foe
the
benefit
of
the
fact
that
in_all
human
truth
there
is be%2:42:05::
some
error
,
and
in_all
our
error
,
some
truth
.
So
great
a
man
could
not
but
understand understand%2:31:01::
,
too
,
that
the
thing
that
moves move%2:36:00::
men
to
sacrifice sacrifice%2:40:00::
their
lives
is be%2:42:06::
not
the
error
of
their
thought
,
which
their
opponents
see see%2:31:01::
and
attack attack%2:33:00::
,
but
the
truth
which
the
latter
do
not
see see%2:31:01::
-
any_more
than
they
see see%2:31:01::
the
error
which
mars mar%2:30:00::
the
truth
they
themselves
defend defend%2:33:00::
.
It
is
much
less
difficult
now
than
in
Lincoln
's
day
to
see see%2:31:01::
that
on
both
sides
sovereign
Americans
had
given give%2:40:10::
their
lives
in
the
Civil_War
to
maintain maintain%2:42:00::
the
balance
between
the
powers
they
had
delegated delegate%2:41:01::
to
the
States
and
to
their
Union
.
They
