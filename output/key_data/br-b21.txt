All
false
gods
resemble resemble%2:42:00::
Moloch
,
at_least
in
the
early
phases
of
their
careers
,
so
it
would
be be%2:42:03::
unreasonable
to
expect expect%2:31:00::
any
form
of
idol-worship
to
become become%2:42:00::
widespread
without
the
accompaniment
of
human
sacrifice
.
But
there
is
reason
in_all
things
,
and
in_this
country
the
heathenish
cult
of
the
motor-car
is
exceeding exceed%2:33:00::
all
bounds
in
its
demands
.
The
annual
butchery
of
40000
American
men
,
women
and
children
to
satiate satiate%2:34:00::
its
blood-lust
is be%2:42:03::
excessive
;
a
quota
of
25000
a
year
would
be be%2:42:03::
more_than
sufficient
.
No
other
popular
idol
is
accorded accord%2:40:00::
even
that_much
grace
.
If
the
railroads
,
for_example
,
regularly
slaughtered slaughter%2:30:00::
25000
passengers
each_year
,
the
high_priests
of
the
cult
would
have have%2:40:04::
cause
to
tremble tremble%2:29:00::
for
their
personal
safety
,
for
such
a
holocaust
would
excite excite%2:37:02::
demands
for
the
hanging
of
every
railroad
president
in
the
United_States
.
But
by
comparison
with
the
railroad
,
the
motor
car
is be%2:42:03::
a
relatively
new
object
of
popular
worship
,
so
it
is be%2:42:03::
too_much
to
hope hope%2:37:01::
that
it
may
be
brought bring%2:35:04::
within
the
bounds
of
civilized
usage
quickly
and
easily
.
Yet
it
is be%2:42:02::
plainly
time
to
make make%2:41:00::
a
start
,
and
to
be be%2:42:03::
effective
the
first
move
should
be be%2:42:03::
highly
dramatic
,
without
being be%2:42:03::
fanatical
.
Here
,
then
,
is
what
Swift
would
have
called call%2:32:02::
a
modest
proposal
by
way
of
a
beginning
.
From
next
New_Year

Day
let
us
keep keep%2:31:00::
careful
account
of
each
successive
fatality
on
the
highways
,
publicizing publicize%2:32:00::
it
on
all

To
avoid avoid%2:32:00::
suspicion
of
bigotry

let
the
hand
of
vengeance
be
stayed stay%2:30:01::
until
the
meat-wagon
has
picked_up pick_up%2:38:01::
the
twenty-five

but
let
the
twenty-five
thousand
and
first
butchery
be be%2:42:06::
the
signal
for
the
arrest
of
the
50
state_highway
commissioners
.
Then
let
the
whole
lot
be
hanged hang%2:41:00::
in
a
public
mass
execution
on
July

,
1963
.
The
scene
,
of_course
,
should
be be%2:42:04::
nine

northwest
of
Centralia

Illinois

the

A

Independence_Day

the

instituted institute%2:36:01::
among

secure secure%2:40:01::
to

,
the
first
of_which
is be%2:42:06::
life
,
and
when
any
government
becomes become%2:30:00::
subversive
of_that
end
,
it
is be%2:42:06::
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter alter%2:30:01::
or
abolish abolish%2:41:00::
it
.
The
highway_system
is be%2:42:03::
an

which
is be%2:42:03::
obviously
a
silly
thing
for
any
government
to
do do%2:41:01::
.
Hanging hang%2:41:00::
the
responsible
officials
would
not
abolish abolish%2:41:00::
the
government

but
would
emphasize emphasize%2:30:00::
its

lives
of
its
individual
citizens
,
which
would
certainly
alter alter%2:30:01::
it
,
and
definitely
for
the
better
.
Moreover
,
the
salubrious
effects
would
not
be be%2:42:03::
exclusively
political
,
but
at_least
partially
,
and
perhaps
primarily
social
.
It
would
challenge challenge%2:32:01::
sharply
not
the
cult
of
the
motor
car
itself
but
some
of
its
ancillary
beliefs
and
practices
-
for_instance
,
the
doctrine
that
the

merely

the
cardinal
sin
of
stasis

or
,
as_it_is
generally
termed term%2:32:00::
,
staying_put

True
,
the
adherents
of
staying_put
are
now
reduced reduce%2:41:00::
to
a

even
a
miniscule
sect

and
their
credo
,
``
Home-keeping
hearts
are be%2:42:03::
happiest
''
,
is be%2:42:03::
as
disreputable
as
Socinianism

Nonetheless
,
although
few
in
number
they
are be%2:42:03::
a
stubborn
crew
,
as
tenacious
of
life
as
the

which
suggests suggest%2:32:03::
that
there
is
some
kind_of

in
their

Perhaps
there
is
more
truth
than
we
are be%2:42:03::
wont_to

in
the
conviction
of_that

that
the

``

In_any_event
,
the
yearly
sacrifice
of
40000
victims
is be%2:42:03::
a
hecatomb

large
to

Somehow
our

reason

Since
appeals

have
had have%2:30:00::
such
small

perhaps
our

the
deterrent_example

If
we

that

the
lesson

To
hang hang%2:41:00::
50
Governors
might
be be%2:42:03::
preferable
except
that
they
are be%2:42:03::
not

so
,
all
things
considered consider%2:39:00::
,
the
highway
commissioners
would
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
be
elected elect%2:41:00::
.
As
the
new
clouds
of
radioactive
fallout
spread
silently
and
invisibly
around
the
earth
,
the
Soviet_Union
stands stand%2:42:04::
guilty
of
a
monstrous
crime
against
the
human_race
.
But
the
guilt
is
shared share%2:42:00::
by
the
United_States
,
Britain
and
France
,
the
other
members
of
the
atomic
club
.
Until
Moscow
resumed resume%2:30:00::
nuclear
testing
last
September
1
,
the
US
and
UK
had
released release%2:29:01::
more_than
twice_as
much
radiation
into
the
atmosphere
as
the
Russians
,
and
the
fallout
from
the
earlier
blasts
is
still
coming_down come_down%2:38:00::
.
As
it
descends descend%2:38:00::
,
the
concentration
of
radioactivity
builds_up build_up%2:30:01::
in
the
human_body
;
for
a
dose
of
radiation
is be%2:42:06::
not
like
a
flu
virus
which
causes cause%2:36:00::
temporary
discomfort
and_then
dies die%2:30:00::
.
The
effect
of
radiation
is be%2:42:03::
cumulative
over
the
years
-
and
on
to
succeeding
generations
.
So
,
while
we
properly
inveigh inveigh%2:32:00::
against
the
new
poisoning
,
history
is be%2:42:03::
not
likely
to
justify justify%2:32:01::
the
pose
of
righteousness
which
some
in
the
West
were be%2:42:03::
so
quick
to
assume assume%2:31:00::
when
Mr._Khrushchev
made make%2:41:00::
his
cynical
and
irresponsible
threat
.
Shock
,
dismay
and
foreboding
for
future
generations
were be%2:42:03::
legitimate
reactions
;
a
holier-than-thou
sermon
was be%2:42:03::
not
.
On
October
19
,
after
the
Soviets
had
detonated detonate%2:30:00::
at_least
20
nuclear
devices
,
Ambassador_Stevenson
warned warn%2:32:00::
the
UN
General_Assembly
that
this
country
,
in
``
self
protection
''
,
might
have
to
resume resume%2:30:01::
above-ground
tests
.
More
recently
,
the
chairman
of
the
Atomic_Energy
Commission
,
Dr._Glenn_T._Seaborg
,
``
admitted admit%2:32:00::
''
to
a
news_conference
in
Las_Vegas
,
Nevada
,
that
the
US
might
fall_behind fall_behind%2:33:00::
Russia
(
he
apparently
meant mean%2:32:01::
in
weapons
development
)
if
the
Soviets
continue continue%2:32:00::
to
test test%2:41:00::
in
the
atmosphere
while
we
abstain abstain%2:34:00::
.
The
trial_balloons
are be%2:42:03::
afloat
.
All_of
which
makes make%2:30:00::
it
more
imperative
than
ever
that
the
biological
and
genetic
effects
of
fallout
be be%2:42:03::
understood
.
But
for
the
average
citizen
,
unfortunately
,
this
is be%2:42:03::
one
of
science
's
worst-marked
channels
,
full_of
tricky
currents
and
unknown
depths
.
The
scientists
,
in
and
out
of
government
,
do
not
agree agree%2:32:00::
on
some
of
the_most
vital
points
,
at_least
publicly
.
On_the_one_hand
,
the
Public_Health_Service
declared declare%2:32:02::
as
recently
as
October
26
that
present
radiation
levels
resulting result%2:42:00::
from
the
Soviet
shots
``
do
not
warrant warrant%2:32:00::
undue
public
concern
''
or
any
action
to
limit limit%2:41:00::
the
intake
of
radioactive
substances
by
individuals
or
large
population
groups
anywhere
in
the
US
.
But
the
PHS
conceded concede%2:32:00::
that
the
new
radioactive
particles
``
will
add add%2:30:00::
to
the
risk
of
genetic
effects
in
succeeding
generations
,
and
possibly
to
the
risk
of
health
damage
to
some
people
in
the
United_States
''
.
Then
it
added add%2:32:01::
:
``
It
is be%2:42:03::
not
possible
to
determine determine%2:32:00::
how

-
nor
how
many
people
will
be
affected affect%2:29:00::
''
.
Having
hedged hedge%2:32:00::
its
bets
in_this_way
,
PHS
apparently
decided decide%2:31:00::
it
would
be be%2:42:03::
possible
to
make make%2:30:00::
some
sort_of
determination
after_all
:
``
At_present
radiation
levels
,
and
even
at

the
additional

slight

very_few
people
will
be
affected affect%2:29:00::
''
.
Then
,
to
conclude conclude%2:32:01::
on
an
indeterminate
note
:
``
Nevertheless
,
if
fallout
increased increase%2:30:00::
substantially
,
or
remained remain%2:30:00::
high
for
a
long_time
,
it
would
become become%2:42:01::
far
more
important
as
a
potential
health
hazard
in_this
country
and
throughout_the_world
''
.
Dr._Linus_Pauling
,
a
Nobel_Prize
winner
in
chemistry
,
has
been be%2:42:03::
less
ambiguous
,
whether
you
choose choose%2:31:01::
to
agree agree%2:32:00::
with
him
or
not
.
After
declaring declare%2:32:02::
,
in
an
article
last
month
in
Frontier
magazine
,
that
the
Russian
testing
``
carries carry%2:32:07::
with_it
the
possibility
of
the_most
tragic
consequences
of
any
action
in
the
history

world
''
,
he
gave give%2:40:05::
this
estimate
of
the
biologic
and
genetic
consequences
if
the
new
Soviet
shots
totaled total%2:42:00::
200
megatons
:
The
damage
to
human
germ_plasm
would
be be%2:42:03::
such_that
in
the
next
few
generations
160000
children
around
the
world
would
be_born be_born%2:30:00::
with
gross
physical
or
mental
defects
.
Long-lived
carbon-14
from
the
fusion
process
would
cause cause%2:36:00::
four
million
embryonic
,
neonatal
or
childhood
deaths
and
stillbirths
over
the
next
20
generations
,
and
between
200000
and
one
million
human_beings
now
living
would
have have%2:30:00::
their
lives
cut_short cut_short%2:30:02::
by
radiation-produced
diseases
such_as
leukemia
.
Most_of
these
would
be be%2:42:04::
in
the
Northern_Hemisphere
,
where
the
fallout
is
concentrating concentrate%2:30:01::
.
Pauling
's
estimate
of
200
megatons
yield
from
the
present
series
of
Russian
tests
will
probably
turn_out turn_out%2:42:00::
to
be be%2:42:03::
too
high
,
but
a
total
of
100
megatons
is be%2:42:03::
a
distinct
possibility
.
The
lack
of
scientific
unanimity
on
the
effects
of
radiation
is_due be_due%2:42:00::
in_part
to
insufficient
data
covering cover%2:42:02::
large
population
groups
,
from
which
agreed-on
generalizations
could
be
drawn draw%2:31:00::
.
But
more_than
one
conscientious
researcher
has
been
inhibited inhibit%2:30:00::
from
completely
frank
discussion
of
the
available
evidence
by
the
less
excusable
fact
that
fallout
has
been
made make%2:30:00::
a
political
issue
as_well
as
a
scientific
problem
.
Its
dangerous
effects
have
been
downgraded downgrade%2:31:00::
to
the
public
by
some
who
believe believe%2:31:04::
national
security
requires require%2:42:00::
further
testing
.
An
illustration
of_this
attitude
is
found find%2:40:02::
in
John_A._McCone
's
letter
to
Dr._Thomas_Lauritsen
,
reported report%2:32:00::
in
a
note
elsewhere
in_this
issue
of
The
New_Republic
.
To
this
day
the
Atomic_Energy
Commission
shies_away_from shy_away_from%2:32:00::
discussing discuss%2:32:01::
the
health
aspects
of
fallout
.
A
recent
study
on
radiation
exposure
by
the
AEC
's
division
of
biology
and
medicine
stated state%2:32:00::
:
``
The
question
of
the
biological
effect
of
[
radiation
]
doses
is
not
considered consider%2:39:00::
''
herein
.
Of_course
,
the
AEC
is be%2:42:03::
in
a
bind
now
.
If
it
comes_down come_down%2:38:00::
too
hard
on
the
potential
dangers
of
fallout
,
it
will
box
the
President
on
resuming resume%2:30:01::
atmospheric
tests
.
So
the
Commission
's
announcements
of
the
new
Soviet
shots
have
been
confined confine%2:35:03::
to
one
or
two
bleak
sentences
,
with
the
fission
yield
usually
left leave%2:42:01::
vague
.
Now
,
of_course
,
that
the
Russians
are be%2:42:03::
the
nuclear
villains
,
radiation
is be%2:42:03::
a
nastier
word
than
it
was be%2:42:03::
in
the
mid-1950s
,
when
the
US
was
testing test%2:41:00::
in
the
atmosphere
.
The
prevailing
official
attitude
then
seemed seem%2:39:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
that
fallout
,
if_not
exactly
good_for_you
,
might
not
be be%2:42:03::
much
worse
than
a
bad
cold
.
After
a
nuclear
blast
,
one
bureaucrat
suggested suggest%2:32:00::
in
those
halcyon
days
,
about
all
you
had
to
do do%2:41:01::
was
haul haul%2:35:01::
out
the
broom
and
sweep sweep%2:35:00::
off
your
sidewalks
and
roof
.
Things
are be%2:42:03::
n't
that
simple
anymore
.
Yet
if
Washington
gets get%2:30:00::
too
indignant
about
Soviet
fallout
,
it
will
have
to
do do%2:41:01::
a_lot_of

As
of
October
25
,
the
AEC
had
reported report%2:32:04::
24
shots
in
the
new
Soviet
series
,
12
of
them
in
a
megaton
range
,
including include%2:42:00::
a
super
bomb
with
a
yield
of
30
to
50
megatons
(
the
equivalent
of
30
million
to
50
million
tons
of
TNT
)
;
and

indicated indicate%2:32:03::
there
were be%2:42:04::
one

those
reported report%2:32:04::
.
Assuming assume%2:31:00::
the
lower
figure
for
the
big
blast
and
one_shot
estimated estimate%2:31:00::
by
the
Japanese
at
10
megatons
,
a
conservative
computation
is be%2:42:03::
that
the
24
announced
tests
produced produce%2:36:00::
a
total
yield
of
at_least
60
megatons
.
Some
government
scientists
say say%2:32:01::
privately
that
the
figure
probably
is be%2:42:07::
closer
to
80
megatons
,
and
that
the
full
50
-
megaton_bomb
that
Khrushchev
mentioned mention%2:32:02::
may
still
be
detonated detonate%2:30:00::
.
If
the
new
Soviet
series
has
followed follow%2:42:05::
the
general
pattern
of
previous
Russian
tests
,
the
shots
were be%2:42:03::
roughly
half
fission
and
half
fusion
,
meaning mean%2:42:00::
a
fission
yield
of
30
to
40
megatons
thus_far
.
To
this
must
be
added add%2:30:00::
the
90
to
92
megatons
of
fission
yield
produced produce%2:36:00::
between
