Rachel
steered steer%2:38:01::
me
along
toward
a
school
for
young
boys
beginning begin%2:30:00::
to
study study%2:31:00::
the
Torah
.
Bits
of
trash
lay lie%2:42:00::
in
the
roadway
.
The
air
smelled smell%2:39:00::
warmish
and
foul
.
A
young
man
appeared appear%2:30:00::
out
of
a
side
alley
and
walked walk%2:38:00::
toward
us
with
quick
strides
.
He
wore wear%2:29:00::
a
long
double-breasted
coat
of
a
heavy
material
,
dark
trousers
,
and
black
boots
with
buckles
.
His
black
hat
with
its
wide
brim
,
high
crown
,
and
fur
trim
rode ride%2:38:02::
high
.
With
his
head
erect
,
he
approached approach%2:38:00::
,
not
glancing glance%2:39:00::
at
us
,
and
passed_by pass_by%2:38:00::
with
his
clear
eyes
raised
and
fixed
straight
ahead
.
He
had have%2:42:00::
a
pinkish-white
complexion
,
a
small
straight
nose
,
a
short
black
beard
,
and
tightly
curled
paot
.
I
was be%2:42:03::
suddenly
conscious
of
my
bare
arms
.
The
girls
in
the
market
place
wore wear%2:29:00::
long-sleeved
dresses
and
covered cover%2:35:00::
their
legs
with
cloth
stockings
.
I
turned turn%2:38:00::
and
watched watch%2:39:00::
him
stride stride%2:38:04::
down
the
center
of
the
road
.
His
hands
were
swinging swing%2:38:00::
at
his
sides
,
and
he
passed_through pass_through%2:38:00::
the
dingy
market
place
with
his
back
straight
and
,
pivoting pivot%2:38:00::
on
his
heel
,
he
entered enter%2:38:00::
an
old
stone
building
.
Rachel
had
seen see%2:39:00::
me
watching watch%2:39:00::
the
young
man
.
She
smiled smile%2:29:00::
.
``
When
your
mother
was be%2:42:05::
here
he
must
have
been be%2:42:03::
a
young
boy
.
Like
the
ones
you
will
see see%2:39:00::
now
''
.
I
swallowed swallow%2:34:00::
hard
and
looked look%2:39:00::
down
at
my
feet
plodding plod%2:38:00::
along
beside
Rachel
.
She
led lead%2:38:01::
me
into
a
twisting
side
alley
.
The
dirty
,
discolored
buildings
looked look%2:39:01::
boarded_up
,
and
their
few
windows
stood stand%2:42:04::
high
above
our
heads
.
Rachel
said say%2:32:00::
that
schools
and
synagogues
occupied occupy%2:42:02::
most_of
the
buildings
.
We
entered enter%2:38:00::
one
where
the
front_door
stood stand%2:42:04::
ajar
and
climbed climb%2:38:00::
a
flight
of
steep
steps
to
the
main
floor
.
An
old_man
with
a
white
beard
and
dressed
in
a
long
shabby
coat
,
baggy
trousers
,
and
a
black
skullcap
greeted greet%2:32:00::
us
.
Rachel
talked talk%2:32:01::
to
him
.
He
nodded nod%2:32:01::
,
clasping clasp%2:35:00::
and
unclasping unclasp%2:35:00::
his
hands
over
his
paunch
,
and
flicked flick%2:38:00::
glances
at
me
.
I
thought think%2:31:03::
he
would
ask ask%2:32:01::
us
to
leave leave%2:38:01::
because
Rachel
and
I
were be%2:42:03::
bare-armed
,
but
he
looked look%2:39:00::
down
into
his
beard
and
preceded precede%2:38:00::
us
down
the
corridor
.
His
toes
pointed point%2:42:00::
out
toward
the
walls
.
He
stopped stop%2:38:00::
in_front
of
a
door
,
placed place%2:35:00::
a
finger
on
his
lips
,
and
,
still
peering peer%2:39:00::
down
into
his
beard
,
pushed push%2:38:00::
open
the
door
to
a
classroom
.
We
stepped step%2:38:00::
inside
.
He
left leave%2:38:00::
us
.
Little
boys
crowded_together crowd_together%2:38:00::
on
long
wooden
benches
,
and
in_the_center
of
the
room
sat sit%2:35:00::
the
teacher
.
His
black
beard
dripped drip%2:38:00::
down
over
the
front
of
his
coat
.
One
white
hand
poised poise%2:35:02::
a
stick
above
his
desk
.
He
turned turn%2:38:00::
his
surly
,
half-closed
eyes
toward
us
,
stared stare%2:39:00::
for
a
second
,
then
shouted shout%2:32:00::
in
Yiddish
,
``
One
,
two
,
three
''
!
rapping rap%2:35:00::
the
stick
against
the
desk
.
The
little
boys
shrilled shrill%2:32:00::
out
a
Yiddish
translation
or
interpretation
of
the
Five
Books
of
Moses
,
which
they
had
previously
chanted chant%2:32:00::
in
Hebrew
.
They
chanted chant%2:32:00::
a
fixed
tune
in
time
to
the
report
of
the
stick
.
Each
boy
opened open%2:35:00::
his
small
mouth
wide
and
rocked rock%2:38:01::
back_and_forth
on
the
bench
in
the
way
his
grandfather
and
great-grandfather
had
studied study%2:31:01::
and
prayed pray%2:32:00::
in
the
ghettos
of
Europe
.
The
boys
were be%2:42:03::
tiny
.
They
had have%2:40:00::
large
bright
eyes
,
the
small
upturned
noses
of
all
babies
everywhere
,
and
hair
cropped
short
except
for
the
long
ringlets
of
paot
framing frame%2:35:00::
their
little
white
faces
.
They
bent bend%2:38:00::
over
yellowed
prayerbooks
and
looked look%2:39:00::
up
only
to
watch watch%2:39:00::
the
teacher
.
Since
they
did
not
glance glance%2:39:00::
curiously
at
us
once
,
I
guessed guess%2:31:00::
that
there
was
a
penalty
for
distraction
.
The
guttural
language
from
the
ghetto
stopped stop%2:42:00::
.
The
teacher
plunged plunge%2:31:01::
the
children
into
a
new
portion
,
this
time
in
Hebrew
,
rapping rap%2:35:00::
the
stick
incessantly
.
One
boy
who
rocked rock%2:38:01::
back_and_forth
over
his
worn
book
had have%2:40:00::
bright
red
hair
and
freckles
.
His
tightly
curled
paot
hung hang%2:35:03::
down
to
his
narrow
shoulders
.
In_the_center
of
his
brilliant
curls
sat sit%2:42:00::
a
small
black
skullcap
.
His
head
barely
rose rise%2:42:00::
above
the
table
.
I
stared stare%2:39:00::
at
him
for
a
long_time
.
He
did
not
return return%2:40:08::
my
interest
.
My
eyes
traveled travel%2:38:00::
over
the
bare
walls
and
up_to
the
one
partially
open
window
high
above
the
little
figures
and
back
to
the
boys
.
Some
of
them
ignored ignore%2:39:00::
the
texts
and
had
apparently
memorized memorize%2:31:00::
the
words
long_ago
.
They
singsonged singsong%2:32:00::
the
portion
at
the
teacher
,
who
accompanied accompany%2:36:00::
them
in
an
off-key
baritone
and
spurred spur%2:37:00::
them
on
with
the
stick
.
The
tapping
defined define%2:42:00::
the
rhythm
and
kept keep%2:42:00::
the
boys
awake
.
I
could
not
keep keep%2:42:00::
my
eyes
away
from
the
boy
with
the
red
hair
.
His
body
pitched pitch%2:38:03::
back_and_forth
on
the
bench
.
His
front_teeth
were be%2:42:03::
missing
.
I
shuddered shudder%2:29:00::
and
backed_out back_out%2:38:00::
of
the
room
.
Rachel
followed follow%2:38:00::
,
looked look%2:39:00::
at
me
,
and
clucked cluck%2:32:00::
with
her
tongue
.
We
walked walk%2:38:00::
down
the
cool
hall
silently
.
From
behind
us
came come%2:38:00::
the
rapping
of
the
stick
and
the
high-pitched
voices
of
the
boys
who
would
grow grow%2:30:04::
to
devote devote%2:32:00::
their
lives
to
rigid
study
and
prayer
.
I
said say%2:32:00::
,
``
How
long
do
they
keep keep%2:42:07::
that
up
''
?
``
All
day
''
,
she
said say%2:32:00::
.
``
Except
for
Shabbat
,
when
they
are
praying pray%2:32:00::
all
day
''
.
I
rubbed rub%2:35:00::
my
hands
together
.
They
had
turned turn%2:30:04::
numb
and
prickly
in
the
classroom
.
The
old_man
in
the
baggy
clothes
waited wait%2:42:00::
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
.
He
glanced glance%2:39:00::
down
into
his
beard
and
muttered mutter%2:32:01::
something
in
Yiddish
.
Rachel
said say%2:32:00::
,
``
He
asks ask%2:32:01::
for
money
''
.
She
passed_by pass_by%2:38:00::
him
.
I
reached_into reach_into%2:42:00::
the
pocket
of
my
skirt
,
fingered finger%2:35:00::
ten
pruta
,
and
dropped drop%2:38:01::
the
coin
.
Then
I
picked pick_up%2:38:01::
it
up
again
and
handed hand%2:40:00::
it
to
the
old_man
.
He
thanked thank%2:32:00::
me
.
I
did
n't
look look%2:39:00::
at
him
.
I
grinned grin%2:29:00::
at
Rachel
.
``
Does
this
bother bother%2:37:00::

?
I
said say%2:32:00::

She
smiled smile%2:29:00::
to
herself

``

Rachel
