Since

been

generally

beautiful
of
all
translations

However
,

states
,
it
is
offered offer%2:40:02::
``

of_course

whether
the
new

will
have

its
purpose

,
even
more
so
than
good

,
grows grow%2:30:00::
in_depth
and

If
this
new
Bible
does
not
increase increase%2:30:02::
in
significance
by
repeated
readings
throughout
the
years
,
it
will
not
survive survive%2:42:01::
the
ages
as
has
the
King_James_Version
.
However
,
an
initial
perusal
and
comparison
of
some
of
the
famous
passages
with
the
same
parts
of
other
versions
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
speak speak%2:32:01::
well
of
the
efforts
of
the_British
Biblical
scholars
.
One
is be%2:42:03::
impressed
with
the
dignity
,
clarity
and
beauty
of_this
new
translation
into
contemporary
English
,
and
there
is be%2:42:03::
no_doubt
that
the
meaning
of
the
Bible
is be%2:42:03::
more
easily
understandable
to
the
general
reader
in
contemporary
language
than
in
the
frequently
archaic
words
and
phrases
of
the
King_James
.
For_example
,
in
the
third
chapter
of
Matthew
,
verses
13
-
16
,
describing describe%2:32:00::
the
baptism
of
Jesus
,
the
1611
version
reads read%2:42:00::
:
``
Then
cometh
Jesus
from
Galilee
to
Jordan
unto
John
,
to
be
baptized baptize%2:32:00::
of
him
.
``
But
John
forbad forbid%2:32:00::
him
,
saying say%2:32:00::
,
I
have
need
to
be
baptized baptize%2:32:00::
of
thee
,
and
comest
thou
to
me
?
``
And
Jesus
answering answer%2:32:00::
said say%2:32:00::
unto
him
,
Suffer suffer%2:37:00::
it
to
be be%2:42:03::
so
now
:
for
thus
it
becometh
us
to
fulfill fulfill%2:42:00::
all
righteousness
.
Then
he
suffered suffer%2:37:00::
him
.
``
And
Jesus
,
when
he
was
baptized baptize%2:32:00::
went_up go_up%2:38:00::
straightway
out
of
the
water
:
and
lo
,
the
heavens
were
opened open%2:35:06::
unto
him
,
and
he
saw see%2:39:00::
the
Spirit
of
God
descending descend%2:38:00::
like
a
dove
,
and
lighting light%2:38:00::
upon
him
''
.
Certainly
,
the
meaning
is be%2:42:03::
clearer
to
one
who
is be%2:42:03::
not
familiar_with
Biblical
teachings
,
in
the
New_English_Bible
which
reads read%2:42:00::
:
``
Then
Jesus
arrived_at arrive_at%2:38:00::
Jordan
from

and
he
came come%2:38:00::

;
'
I

Among
the_most
frequently
quoted quote%2:32:00::

sentences

the
Beatitudes

by

at
the
beginning
of
the
Sermon_on_the_Mount

To
illustrate illustrate%2:32:00::
,
the
first
blessing
in
the
King_James_Bible
reads read%2:42:00::
:

the
poor

.
Some
of
the
poetic
cadence
of
the
older
version
certainly
is be%2:42:03::
lost
in
the
newer
one
,
but
almost
anyone
,
with
a
fair
knowledge
of
the_English

,
can
understand understand%2:31:00::
the
meaning
,
without
the
necessity

interpretation
by
a
Biblical
scholar
