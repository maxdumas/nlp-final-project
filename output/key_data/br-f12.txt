From_time_to_time
the
medium
mentions mention%2:32:02::
other
people
``
around
him
''
,
who
were be%2:42:05::
``
on
the
other
side
''
,
and
reports report%2:32:00::
what
they
are
saying say%2:32:00::
.
After
a
while
there
come come%2:30:01::
initials
and
names
,
and
he
is be%2:42:03::
interested
to
hear hear%2:39:00::
some
rather
unusual
family
nicknames
.
As
the
hour
progresses progress%2:38:00::
,
the
sensitive
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
probe probe%2:32:00::
more
deeply
and
to
make
more
personal
and
specific
statements
.
There
are be%2:42:04::
a_few
prognoses
of
coming
events
.
Another
medium
,
another
sitter
,
would
produce produce%2:36:02::
a
somewhat
different
content
,
but
in_general
it
would
probably
sound sound%2:39:06::
much
like
the
foregoing
reading
.
Some
mediums
speak speak%2:32:00::
in
practical
,
down-to-earth
terms
,
while
others
may
stress stress%2:32:00::
the
spiritual
.
Not
all
,
as_a_matter_of_fact
,
consider consider%2:31:00::
themselves
``
mediums
''
in
the
sense
of
receiving receive%2:39:00::
messages
from
the
deceased
.
In_fact
,
some
sensitives
rule rule_out%2:33:00::
this
out
,
preferring prefer%2:31:00::
to
consider consider%2:31:00::
their
expression
as
strictly
extra-sensory
perception
(
ESP
)
,
on
this
side
of
the
``
veil
''
.
However
that
may
be
,
people
are be%2:42:03::
known
to
go_to go_to%2:32:00::
mediums
for
diverse
reasons
.
Perhaps
they
are
mourning mourn%2:37:01::
a
recent
death
and
want want%2:37:00::
comfort
,
to
feel feel%2:37:00::
in
touch
with
the
deceased
,
or
seek seek%2:40:00::
indications
for
future
plans
.
They
may
,
of_course
,
be be%2:42:06::
curiosity
seekers
-
or
they
may
just
be be%2:42:03::
interested
in
the
phenomenon
of
mediumship
.
The
mediums
with
whom
the
Parapsychology_Foundation
is
working work%2:41:02::
in_this
experiment
are be%2:42:03::
in
a
waking
or
only
slightly
dissociated
state
,
so_that
the
sitter
can
make
comments
,
ask ask%2:32:02::
and
answer answer%2:32:00::
questions
,
instead
of
talking talk%2:32:01::
with
a
``
control
''
who
speaks speak%2:32:00::
through
an
entranced
sensitive
.
What
we
have have%2:39:06::
here
is be%2:42:03::
in
some
ways
more
like
an
ordinary
conversation
.
But
it
is be%2:42:02::
not
really
only
a
conversation
.
Many_a
sitter
(
in
a
personal
sitting
)
has
been
amazed amaze%2:31:00::
to
realize realize%2:31:00::
that
the
medium
was
describing describe%2:32:00::
very
vividly
his
state_of_mind
.
He
himself
might_not
have
been be%2:42:03::
really
aware_of
his
own
mood
;
it
had
been be%2:42:03::
latent
,
unspecified
,
semi-conscious
and
only
partly
realized
-
until
she
described describe%2:32:00::
it
to
him
!
Most
striking
indeed
is be%2:42:03::
this
beyond-normal
ability
to
put_a_finger_on
``
pre-conscious
''
moods
and
to
clarify clarify%2:31:00::
them
.
However
,
in
the
next
visit
that
the
researcher
made make%2:41:00::
to
the
medium
,
he
did
not
receive receive%2:30:01::
a
personal
reading
.
Instead
he
brought bring%2:38:00::
with
him
the
names
of
some
people
he
had
never
met meet%2:38:01::
and
of
whom
the
medium
knew know%2:31:01::
nothing
.
For
this
was be%2:42:03::
to
be be%2:42:02::
a
``
proxy
sitting
''
.
As
was
noted note%2:32:00::
earlier
,
it
is be%2:42:03::
important
that
in
valid
,
objective
study
of_this
sort_of
communication
,
the
interested
sitter
should
be
separated separate%2:35:01::
from
the
sensitive
.
Dr._Karlis_Osis
,
Director_of_Research
at
the
Parapsychology_Foundation
,
described describe%2:32:01::
the
basis
for
the
experiment
in
a
Tomorrow
article
,
(
``
New_Research
on
Survival
After
Death
''
,
Spring
1958
)
.
He
remarked remark%2:32:00::
:
``
It
has
been
clearly
established establish%2:31:00::
that
in
a_number_of
instances
the
message
did
not
come come%2:42:04::
from
a
spirit
but
was
received receive%2:39:00::
telepathically
by
the
medium
from
the
sitter
''
.
The
possibility
has_to
be
ruled_out rule_out%2:42:00::
that
the
medium
's
ESP
may
tap tap%2:40:00::
the
memory
of
the
sitter
,
and
to
do do%2:41:01::
this
,
the
two
central
characters
in_this
drama
must
be
separated separate%2:35:01::
.
One
way
to
do do%2:41:01::
this
is be%2:42:03::
by
``
proxy
sittings
''
,
wherein
the
person
seeking seek%2:40:00::
a
message
does
not
himself
meet meet%2:41:01::
with
the
medium
but
is
represented represent%2:41:02::
by
a
substitute
,
the
proxy
sitter
.
If
the
latter
knows know%2:31:01::
nothing
about
the
absent
sitter
except
his
name
(
given give%2:40:07::
by
the
experimenter
)
,
he
cannot
possibly
give give%2:40:05::
any
clues
,
conscious
or
unconscious
,
far
less
ask ask%2:32:02::
leading
questions
.
All
he
can
do
is be%2:42:03::
to
be be%2:42:03::
an
objective
and
careful
questioner
,
seeking seek%2:41:00::
to
help help%2:41:00::
the
sensitive
in
clarifying clarify%2:30:00::
and
making make%2:30:00::
more
specific
her
paranormal
impressions
.
Sometimes
in
these
experiments
``
appointment
sittings
''
are
used use%2:34:01::
.
Here
the
absent
sitter
makes
a
``
date
''
with
a
communicator
(
someone
close_to
him
who
is be%2:42:03::
deceased
)
,
asking ask%2:32:01::
him
to
``
come_in come_in%2:38:02::
''
at
a
certain
hour
,
when
a
channel
will
be be%2:42:03::
open
for
him
.
In_this
case
the
proxy
sitter
will
know know%2:31:01::
only
the
name
of
the
communicator
,
nothing
else
.
He
gives give%2:40:07::
this
to
the
medium
at
the
appointed
time
,
and
the
reading
then
will
be
concerned concern%2:42:00::
with
material
about
or
messages
from
the
communicator
.
As
always
,
a
tape_recording
or
detailed
notes
are
made make%2:36:00::
,
and
a
typescript
of_this
is
sent send%2:32:02::
to
the
absent
sitter
.
So
this
proxy
situation
has
set_up set_up%2:36:01::
at_least
a
partial
barrier
between
the
medium
's
ESP
and
the
absent
sitter
's
mind
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
now
harder
to
assume assume%2:31:00::
telepathy
as
a
basis
for
the
statements
-
though
research
still
does
not
know know%2:31:01::
how
far
afield
ESP
can
range range%2:42:03::
.
Now
the
original
absent
sitter
must
decide decide%2:31:00::
whether
the
statements
are be%2:42:03::
meaningful
to
him
.
Here
again
laboratory
approaches
are
being
evolved evolve%2:30:02::
,
for
it
is
recognized recognize%2:31:02::
how
``
elastic
''
these
readings
can
be be%2:42:03::
,
how
they
can
apply apply%2:42:00::
to
many
people
,
and
are
often
stated state%2:32:00::
in_general
terms
all_too
easily
applied apply%2:34:00::
to
any
individual
's
own
case
.
If
you
look_at look_at%2:39:01::
a
reading
meant
for
someone
else
,
you
will
probably
see see%2:31:01::
that
many_of
the
items
could
be
considered consider%2:31:00::
as
applicable
to
you
,
even
when
you
were be%2:42:04::
not
in
the
picture
at_all
!
An
interested
sitter
may
think think%2:31:01::
the
sensitive
has
made make%2:41:00::
a
``
hit
''
,
describing describe%2:32:01::
something
accurately
for
him
,
but
can
he
really
be be%2:42:03::
sure
that
another
sitter
,
hearing hear%2:39:00::
the
same
statement
,
would
not
apply apply%2:34:00::
it
subjectively
to
his
own
circumstances
?
It
is be%2:42:03::
,
of_course
,
easy
to
see see%2:31:01::
how
``
J
''
will
mean mean%2:32:03::
Uncle_Jack
to
one
person
and
little
Jane
to
another
.
``
A
journey
''
,
``
a_little
white_house
''
,
``
a
change
of
outlook
''
,
can
apply apply%2:42:00::
to
many
people
.
And
even
more
complex
items
can
be
interpreted interpret%2:32:00::
to
conform_to conform_to%2:42:01::
one
's
own
point_of_view
,
which
is be%2:42:03::
by
nature
so
personal
.
One
sitter
may
think think%2:31:01::
``
a
leather
couch
''
identifies identify%2:31:00::
a
reading
as
surely
directed direct%2:33:01::
to
him
;
to
another
,
it
seems seem%2:39:01::
that
nobody
but
his
father
ever
used use%2:34:01::
the
phrase
,
``
Atta
boy
''
!
To
get_around get_around%2:32:01::
this
quite
difficult
corner
,
there
is be%2:42:00::
one
first_aid
to
objectiveness
:
prevent prevent%2:41:00::
the
distant
sitter
from
knowing know%2:31:01::
which
reading
was be%2:42:03::
for
him
.
If
he
is
not
told tell%2:32:00::
which
of
four
or
five
readings
was
meant
for
him
,
he
can
more
readily
assess assess%2:31:00::
each
item
in
a
larger
frame
:
``
Does
that
statement
really
sound sound%2:39:06::
as
if
it
were be%2:42:03::
for
me
,
significant
in
my
particular
life
?
Or
am
I
taking take%2:31:03::
something
that
could
really
apply apply%2:42:00::
to
almost
anybody
,
and
forgetting forget%2:31:01::
that
many
other
people
probably
have
had have%2:39:06::
a
similar
experience
''
?
Conversely
,
experimenters
would
consider consider%2:31:00::
as
impressive
such
statements
as
the
following
,
which
,
if
they
turned_out turn_out%2:42:00::
to
be be%2:42:06::
hits
,
are be%2:42:03::
so
unusual
as
to
be be%2:42:03::
really
significant
:
``
He
had have%2:40:00::
four
children
,
two
sets
of
twins
.
After
being be%2:41:00::
a
lawyer
for
twenty-five
years
he
started start%2:30:00::
studying study%2:31:00::
for
the
ministry
.
Part
of
his
house
had
been
moved move%2:38:01::
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
.
He
died die%2:30:00::
of
typhoid
in
1921
''
.
Methods
have
been
developed develop%2:36:00::
of
assigning assign%2:40:01::
``
weights
''
to
statements
;
that_is
,
it
is
known know%2:31:06::
empirically
that
names
beginning begin%2:42:00::
with
R
are be%2:42:03::
more
common
than
those
beginning begin%2:42:00::
with
Z
;
that
fewer
women
are be%2:42:03::
named
Miranda
than
Elizabeth
;
that
in
the
United_States
more
people
die die%2:30:00::
of
heart_disease
than
of
smallpox
.
So
each
reading
can
be
given give%2:40:03::
a
weight
and
each
reading
a
score
by
adding_up add_up%2:32:00::
these
weights
.
Specific
dates
would
be be%2:42:03::
important
,
as
would
double
names
.
Various
categories
have
been
explored explore%2:31:00::
to
find_out find_out%2:31:00::
about
these
``
empirical
probabilities
''
against
which
to
measure measure%2:30:00::
the
readings
.
In
The
Parapsychology_Foundation
's
long-range
experiment
,
readings
are
made make%2:41:00::
by
a
variety
of
sensitives
for
a
large_number
of
cooperating
sitters
,
trying try%2:41:00::
to
throw throw%2:35:07::
light
on
this
question
of
the
significance
of
mediumistic
statements
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
very
important
indeed
,
in
the
field
of
extra-sensory
perception
and
its
relation_to
the
survival
hypothesis
,
to
know know%2:31:01::
whether
the
statements
are be%2:42:03::
actually
only
those
which
any
intuitive
person
might
venture venture%2:32:00::
and
an
eager
sitter
attach attach%2:35:01::
to
himself
.
Or
,
on_the_other_hand
,
are
unlikely
facts
being
stated state%2:32:00::
,
facts
which
are be%2:42:03::
in
themselves
significant
and
not
easily
applicable
to
everybody
?
That
is be%2:42:02::
one
thing
the
experiments
are
designed design%2:36:02::
to
find_out find_out%2:32:00::
.
So
,
after
the
sitting
has
been
held hold%2:36:00::
,
several
readings
at_one_time
are
mailed mail%2:35:00::
,
and
the
distant
sitter
(
whose
name
or
whose
communicator
's
name
was
given give%2:40:07::
to
the
medium
)
must
mark mark%2:35:09::
each
little
item
as
Correct
(
Hit
)
,
Incorrect
(
Miss
)
,
Doubtful
,
or
Especially
Significant
(
applying apply%2:42:00::
to
him
and
,
he
feels feel%2:31:00::
,
not
to
anyone
else
)
.
He
is
required require%2:32:01::
to
mark mark%2:35:09::
every
item
and
to
indicate indicate%2:32:03::
which
reading
he
feels feel%2:31:00::
is be%2:42:03::
actually
his
.
All
these
evaluations
are
then
totted_up tot_up%2:32:00::
and
tabulated tabulate%2:36:00::
,
by
adding_up add_up%2:32:00::
the
Hits
and
Significants
,
with
the
weight
placed place%2:35:00::
on
those
in
the
sitter
's
own
reading
.
That_is
,
if
he
marks mark%2:35:09::
as
most
correct
a
reading
not
meant
for
him
,
the
total
experimental
score
falls fall%2:30:06::
.
Conversely
,
if
he
gives give%2:40:03::
a
heavy
rating
to
his
own
reading
,
and
finds find%2:40:02::
more
accurate
facts
in
it
than
in
the
others
,
a
point
is
chalked_up chalk_up%2:32:00::
for
the
intrinsic
,
objective
meaningfulness
of_this
type
of
mediumistic
material
.
And
there
are be%2:42:00::
some
positive
results
,
though
the
final
findings
will
not
be
known know%2:31:02::
for
a
long_time
-
and_then
further
research
can
be
formulated formulate%2:32:03::
.
In
another
approach
to
the
same
procedure
,
the
content
of
the
readings
is
analyzed analyze%2:31:00::
so_as_to
see see%2:31:02::
how
the
particular
medium
is be%2:42:03::
likely
to
slant slant%2:31:00::
her
statements
.
Does
she
often
speak speak%2:32:00::
of
locations
,
of
cause
of
death
?
Does
she
accurately
give give%2:40:07::
dates
,
ages
,
kind_of
occupation
?
It
is be%2:42:03::
possible
to
find_out find_out%2:32:00::
in_which
categories
most_of
her
correct
statements
fall fall%2:42:03::
,
and
where
she
makes make%2:41:00::
most_of
her
``
hits
''
.
Now
when
,
so_to_speak
,
the
cream
has
been
skimmed_off skim_off%2:35:00::
,
and
the
items
in
the
successful
categories
separated_out separate_out%2:35:00::
,
the
sitter
can
be
asked ask%2:32:01::
to
consider consider%2:32:00::
and
rate rate%2:31:00::
only
this
concentrated
``
cream
''
,
where
the
sensitive
is be%2:42:03::
at
her
best
.
Mediumistic
impressions
are be%2:42:03::
evidently
of
all
sorts
and
seem seem%2:39:00::
to
involve involve%2:42:04::
all
the
senses
.
``
I
feel feel%2:29:00::
cold
''
,
the
medium
says say%2:32:00::
,
or
``
My
leg
aches ache%2:39:00::
''
,
``
My
head
is be%2:42:03::
heavy
''
.
Or
perhaps
she
hears hear%2:39:00::
words
or
sounds
:
``
There
's
such
a
noise
of
loud
machinery
''
,
or
``
I
hear hear%2:39:00::
a
child
crying cry%2:29:00::

He
says say%2:32:00::

're be%2:42:05::

.
Maybe
an
entire
scene
comes come%2:42:01::
into
consciousness
,
with
action
and
motion
,
or
a
static
view
:
``
a
house
under
a
pine_tree
,
with
a_little
stone
path
going go%2:42:00::
up
to
the
door
''
.
The
sensitive
often
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
smell smell%2:39:01::
definite
odors
,
too
,
or
subjectively
feels feel%2:37:00::
emotions
.
Sometimes
she
displays display%2:39:00::
amazing
eidetic
imagery
and
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
see see%2:39:00::
all
details
in
perspective
,
as
if
the
scene
were be%2:42:04::
actually
there
.
If
pressed press%2:32:00::
by
the
sitter
for
more
detail
,
she
may
be be%2:42:03::
able
to
bring bring%2:35:04::
the
picture
more
into
focus
and
see see%2:39:00::
more
sharply
,
almost
as
if
she
were
physically
going go%2:38:00::
closer
.
If
asked ask%2:32:00::
how
she
gets get%2:30:03::
her
impressions
,
she
probably
can
only
say say%2:32:00::
that
she
``
just
gets get%2:30:03::
them
''
-
some
more
vividly
than
others
.
Perhaps
this
is be%2:42:03::
not
so
extraordinary
after_all
.
Even
in
normal
experience
one
gets get%2:30:03::
impressions
without
knowing know%2:31:01::
exactly
how
-
of
atmosphere
,
of
one
another
's
personalities
,
moods
,
intentions
.
Of_course
,
there
is be%2:42:00::
an
element
of
training
here
:
these
gifted
people
,
by
concentration
,
study
,
guidance
,
have
learned learn%2:31:00::
to
develop develop%2:30:06::
their
power
.
Simply
using use%2:34:01::
it
increases increase%2:30:02::
its
intensity
,
I
was
told tell%2:32:00::
by
one
sensitive
.
Nor
does
a
medium
automatically
know know%2:31:01::
how
to
interpret interpret%2:31:00::
her
imagery
.
Impressions
often
appear appear%2:30:00::
in
a
symbolic
form
and
cannot
be
taken take%2:31:07::
at
face_value
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
apparently
by
symbols
that
the
unconscious
speaks_to speak_to%2:32:00::
the
conscious
,
and
the
medium
has_to
translate translate%2:31:00::
these
into
meaning
.
If
communication
with
an
entity
on
the
``
other
side
''
is
taking_place take_place%2:30:00::
,
this
too
may
assume assume%2:30:00::
the
form
of
clairvoyant
symbolism
.
During
one
reading
an
image
appeared appear%2:30:00::
of
a
prisoner
in
irons
.
But
this
did
not
necessarily
refer refer%2:42:00::
to
an
actual
jail
;
taken take%2:31:07::
with
other
details
it
could
have
referred refer%2:42:00::
to
a
state
of
mental
or
spiritual
confinement
.
In_this
connection
it
is be%2:42:03::
worth
noting note%2:32:00::
how
names
are
sometimes
obtained obtain%2:40:00::
.
Though
they
are
often
heard hear%2:39:00::
clairaudiently
,
as
if
a
voice
were
speaking speak%2:32:00::
them
,
in
other
cases
they
are
apprehended apprehend%2:31:00::
visually
as
symbols
:
a
slope
to
signify signify%2:32:02::
the
name
``
Hill
''
,
for_instance
.
One
medium
saw see%2:39:00::
two
sheets
flapping flap%2:38:01::
on
a
line
and
found find%2:36:00::
that
the
name
Shietz
was be%2:42:03::
significant
to
the
sitter
.
