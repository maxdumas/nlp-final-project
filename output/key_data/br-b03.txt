Sam_Rayburn
was be%2:42:03::
a
good
man
,
a
good
American
,
and
,
third
,
a
good
Democrat
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
all_of
these
rolled
into
one
sturdy
figure
;
Mr._Speaker
,
Mr._Sam
,
and
Mr._Democrat
,
at
one_and_the_same
time
.
The
House
was be%2:42:06::
his
habitat
and
there
he
flourished flourish%2:30:01::
,
first
as
a
young
representative
,
then
as
a
forceful
committee
chairman
,
and
finally
in
the
post
for
which
he
seemed seem%2:39:00::
intended
from
birth
,
Speaker
of
the
House
,
and
second
most
powerful
man
in
Washington
.
Mr._Rayburn
was be%2:42:03::
not
an
easy
man
to
classify classify%2:31:00::
or
to
label label%2:32:00::
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
no
flaming
liberal
,
yet
the
New_Deal
,
the
Fair_Deal
and
the
New_Frontier
needed need%2:42:00::
him
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
not
a
rear-looking
conservative
,
yet
partisans
of_that
persuasion
will
miss miss%2:38:00::
him
as
much_as
any
.
Two
of
the
vital
qualities
demanded demand%2:42:00::
of
a
politician
by
other
politicians
are be%2:42:06::
that
he
always
keep keep%2:41:03::
a
confidence
and
that
he
keep keep%2:41:03::
his
word
.
Sam_Rayburn
took take%2:38:10::
unnumbered
secrets
with
him
to
the
grave
,
for
he
was be%2:42:03::
never
loquacious
,
and
his
word
,
once
given give%2:40:07::
,
was be%2:42:03::
not
subject_to
retraction
.
It
might
be
added add%2:32:01::
that
as
he
kept keep%2:41:03::
his
word
so
he
expected expect%2:32:00::
that
others
keep keep%2:41:03::
theirs
.
The
demonstration
of
his
power
was be%2:42:03::
never
flamboyant
or
theatrical
.
His
leadership
was be%2:42:03::
not
for
audiences
.
A
growl
,
a
nod
,
was be%2:42:03::
usually
enough
.
When
it
was be%2:42:03::
not
,
one
of
the
great
dramas
of
Washington
would
be
presented present%2:36:00::
.
He
would
rise rise%2:38:05::
in
the
well
of
the
House
,
his
chin
upon
his
chest
,
his
hands
gripping grip%2:35:00::
the
side
of
a
desk
,
and
the
political
and
legislative
chatter
would
subside subside%2:30:00::
into
silence
.
He
spoke speak%2:32:03::
briefly
,
sensibly
,
to_the_point
and
without
oratorical
flourishes
He
made make_sense%2:42:00::
good
,
plain
American
common_sense
and
the
House
usually
recognized recognize%2:31:02::
it
and
acted act%2:41:00::
upon
it
.
These
public
efforts
were be%2:42:03::
rare
because
Mr._Rayburn
normally
did do%2:41:04::
his
counseling
,
persuading
and
educating
long
before
an
issue
reached reach%2:38:01::
its
test
on
the
House
floor
.
He
expected expect%2:32:00::
Democrats
to
do do%2:41:04::
their
duty
when
it
had
been
patiently
pointed_out point_out%2:32:02::
to
them
.
With
his
long
service
he
had have%2:40:00::
a
long
memory
,
an
excellent
thing
in
a
political_leader
.
He
was be%2:42:05::
,
of_course
,
in
the
House
for
a_very_long_time
.
There
are be%2:42:05::
only
two
men
remaining remain%2:42:03::
in
Congress
who
,
with
Rayburn
,
voted vote%2:41:13::
for
the
declaration
of
war
against
Germany
in
1917
.
To
almost
two
generations
of
Americans
it
must
have
seemed seem%2:39:00::
as
though
the
existence
of
Mr._Sam
coincided coincide%2:42:00::
with_that
of
the
House
.
And
it
was be%2:42:06::
the
House
he
loved love%2:37:02::
.
To
be be%2:42:06::
presiding_officer
of_it
was be%2:42:06::
the
end
of
his
desire
and
ambition
.
The
Senate
to
him
was be%2:42:03::
not
the
``
upper
body
''
and
he
corrected correct%2:32:00::
those
who
said say%2:32:01::
he
served serve%2:33:00::
``
under
''
the
president

He
served serve%2:33:00::
``
with

Sound sound%2:39:02::
the
roll
of
those
with
whom
he
served serve%2:33:00::
and
who
preceded precede%2:41:00::

in
death

Woodrow_Wilson

And
those
still
with

,
Herbert_C._Hoover
,
Harry_S._Truman
,
Dwight_D._Eisenhower
and
John_F._Kennedy
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
a
fighter
for
those
of
his
own
party
.
Mr._Truman
has have%2:42:05::
only
to
recall recall%2:31:00::
the
``
hopeless
''
campaign
of
1948
to
remember remember%2:31:00::
what
a
loyal
partisan
he
was be%2:42:03::
and
the
first
experience
of
Mr._Kennedy
with
Congress
would
have
been be%2:42:03::
sadder
than
it
was be%2:42:03::
had
not
Mr._Sam
been be%2:42:05::
there
.
As
it
was
,
his
absence
because
of
his
final
illness
was be%2:42:06::
a
blow
to
the
administration
.
With
Republican
presidents
,
he
fought fight%2:33:00::
fair
.
He
was be%2:42:03::
his
own
man
,
not
an
automatic
obstructionist
.
He
kept keep%2:42:07::
his
attacks
on
Republicanism
for
partisan
campaigns
,
but
that
is be%2:42:06::
part
of
the
game
he
was_born be_born%2:30:00::
to
play play%2:33:00::
.
Under
any
name
-
Mr._Speaker
,
Mr._Democrat
,
Mr._Sam
-
he
was be%2:42:03::
a
good
man
.
Thirteen

In
18
months
,
no_more
grisly
incident
has
been
reported report%2:32:04::
from_that
jungle

Simply
out
of
bloodlust
,
their
murderers
dismembered dismember%2:35:00::
the
bodies

tossed toss%2:35:05::

The
excuse
was
offered offer%2:40:02::
for
them
that
they
had

the
Italians
for
Belgian
mercenaries

In_other_words
,
atrocities

the

condoned condone%2:32:00::
,
had
the
victims
been
serving serve%2:42:03::
the
cause
of
dissident
Katanga
.
Does
this
suggest suggest%2:32:03::
that
the
Congo
is be%2:42:03::
fit
for
nationhood
or
that
UN
is
making make%2:41:00::
any
progress
whatever
toward
its
goal
of
so
making_it make_it%2:42:00::
?
To_the_contrary
,
through
the
past
six
weeks
violence
has
been
piled pile%2:35:00::
upon
violence
.
Mass
rapes
,
troop
mutinies
,
uncontrolled
looting
and
pillage
and
reckless
military
adventures
,
given give%2:32:01::
no
sanction
by
any
political
authority
,
have
become become%2:30:00::
almost
daily
occurrences
.
Yet
this
basic
condition
of
outlawry
and
anarchy
is be%2:42:06::
not
the
work
of
Katanga
.
It
happens happen%2:30:00::
in
the
territory
of
the
Leopoldville
government
,
which
is be%2:42:03::
itself
a
fiction
,
demonstrably
incapable_of
governing
,
and
commanding command%2:32:02::
only
such
limited
credit
abroad
as
UN
support
gives give%2:32:01::
it
.
The
main
question
raised raise%2:32:00::
by
the
incident
is be%2:42:06::
how
much
longer
will
UN
bury
its
head
in
the
sand
on
the
Congo
problem
instead
of
facing face%2:32:00::
the
bitter
fact
that
it
has have%2:40:00::
no
solution
in
present
terms
?
The
probable
answer
is be%2:42:06::
that
it
will
do
so
just_as
long
as
Russia
can
exercise exercise%2:41:00::
a
veto
in
favor
of
chaos
and
until
young
African_nations
wake_up wake_up%2:29:00::
to
the
truth
that
out
of
false
pride
they
are
visiting visit%2:32:01::
ruin
on
Central_Africa
.
Right_now
,
they
are
pushing push%2:32:00::
a
resolution
which
would
have
UN
use use%2:34:01::
its
forces
to
invade invade%2:33:00::
and
subjugate subjugate%2:41:01::
Katanga
.
That
notion
is be%2:42:03::
fantastically
wrong-headed
from
several
points_of_view
.
The
UN
army
is be%2:42:03::
too
weak
,
too
demoralized
for
the
task
.
Further
,
it
has have%2:40:00::
its
work
cut_out
stopping stop%2:41:00::
anarchy
where
it
is
now
garrisoned garrison%2:33:00::
.
Last
,
it
makes make_sense%2:42:00::
no
sense
to
deliver deliver%2:40:01::
Katanga
,
the
one
reasonably
solid
territory
,
into
the
existing
chaos
.
The
Congo
should
have
been
mandated mandate%2:41:00::
,
because
it
was be%2:42:03::
not_ready
for
independence
.
The
idea
was
not
even
suggested suggest%2:32:00::
because
political
expediency
prevailed prevail%2:33:00::
over
wisdom
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
perhaps
too
late
now
to
talk talk%2:32:01::
of
mandate
because
it
is be%2:42:03::
inconsistent
with
what
is
termed term%2:32:00::
political
realism
.
But
if
any
realism
and
feeling
for
truth
remain remain%2:30:00::
in
the
General_Assembly
,
it
is be%2:42:06::
time
for
men
of
courage
to
measure measure%2:31:00::
the
magnitude
of
the
failure
and
urge urge%2:32:03::
some
new
approach
.
Otherwise
,
UN
will
march march%2:38:00::
blindly
on
to
certain
defeat
.
A
recent
editorial
discussing discuss%2:32:01::
a
labor-management
agreement
reached reach%2:41:00::
between
the
Southern_Pacific_Co.
and
the
Order
of
Railroad
Telegraphers
has
been
criticized criticize%2:32:00::
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
based base%2:31:00::
on
complete
information
.
The
editorial
was
based base%2:31:00::
on
a
news
association
dispatch
which
said say%2:32:00::
that
the
telegraphers
had
secured secure%2:40:00::
an
agreement
whereby
they
were
guaranteed guarantee%2:32:00::
40
hours
'
pay
per
week
whether
they
worked work%2:41:02::
or
not
and
that
a
reduction
in
their
number
was
limited limit%2:30:01::
to
2
per_cent
per_year
.
Our
comment
was be%2:42:06::
that
this
was be%2:42:03::
``
featherbedding
''
in
its
ultimate
form
and
that
sympathy
for
the
railroad
was
misplaced misplace%2:35:00::
since
it
had
entered enter%2:33:00::
into
such
an
agreement
.
The
statement
was
also
made make%2:36:08::
that
undoubtedly
the
railroad
had
received receive%2:40:00::
some
compensating
benefit
from
the
telegraphers
,
but
that
it
was be%2:42:03::
difficult
to
imagine imagine%2:36:00::
what
could
balance balance%2:42:00::
a
job
for
life
.
Additional
information
supplied supply%2:40:00::
to
us
discloses disclose%2:32:00::
that
the
railroad
gained gain%2:40:03::
a
stabilized
supply
of
telegraphers
of_which
it
was be%2:42:03::
in
need
.
Also
,
normal
personal
attrition
would
make make%2:30:00::
the
job
reduction
provision
more_or_less
academic
.
The
situation
with
regard_to
the
Southern_Pacific
was be%2:42:03::
therefore
a
special
one
and
not
necessarily
applicable
to
other
situations
in
other
industries
.
The
solution
reached reach%2:41:00::
in
the
agreement
was be%2:42:03::
more
acceptable
to
the
railroad
than
that
originally
included include%2:31:00::
in_a_series
of
union

Time
was be%2:42:00::
when
the
house
of

common_sense
side

But
the
internationalists
have
taken_over take_over%2:40:07::
the
governing
body
of
the
bar
,
and
when
the
lads
met meet%2:41:01::
in
St._Louis
,
it
was
not
to
grumble grumble%2:32:01::
about
the
humidity
but
to
vote vote%2:41:13::
unanimously
that
the
United_Nations
was be%2:42:03::
scarcely
less_than
wonderful

despite
an

It
was be%2:42:06::

Meanwhile

in

adding add%2:30:00::
his

A

Another
