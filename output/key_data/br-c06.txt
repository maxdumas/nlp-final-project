West

Tsarism

is be%2:42:03::
the

piece

diplomatic

in
many
years

It
combines combine%2:42:00::
qualities
that
are
seldom

in

work
:
Scrupulous
scholarship
,
a
fund
of
personal
experience
,
a
sense
of
drama
and
characterization
and
a
broad
grasp
of
the
era
's
great
historical
issues

In_short
,
the
book
,
based base%2:31:00::
largely
on
lectures
delivered deliver%2:32:00::
at
Harvard_University
,
is be%2:42:03::
both
reliable
and
readable
;
the
author
possesses possess%2:42:00::
an
uncommonly
fine
English
style
,
and
he
is
dealing deal%2:32:08::
with
subjects
of
vast
importance
that
are be%2:42:03::
highly
topical
for
our
time
.
If
Mr._Kennan
is be%2:42:03::
sometimes
a_little
somber
in
his
appraisals
,
if
his
analysis
of
how
Western
diplomacy
met meet%2:34:00::
the
challenge
of
an
era
of
great_wars
and
social
revolutions
is be%2:42:03::
often
critical
and
pessimistic
-
well
,
the
record
itself
is be%2:42:03::
not
too
encouraging
.
Mr._Kennan
takes take%2:41:04::
careful
account
of
every
mitigating
circumstance
in
recalling recall%2:31:00::
the
historical
atmosphere
in_which
mistaken
decisions
were
taken
.
But
he
rejects reject%2:31:00::
,
perhaps
a_little
too
sweepingly
,
the
theory
that
disloyal
and
pro-Communist
influences
may
have
contributed contribute%2:41:12::
to
the
policy
of
appeasing appease%2:32:00::
Stalin
which
persisted persist%2:42:00::
until
after
the
end
of
the
war
and
reached reach%2:38:00::
its
high
point
at
the
Yalta_Conference
in
February
,
1945
.
After_all
,
Alger_Hiss
,
subsequently
convicted convict%2:32:00::
of
perjury
in
denying deny%2:32:00::
that
he
gave give%2:40:00::

agents

at
Yalta
.
And
Harry_Dexter_White
,
implicated
in
F._B._I.
reports
in
Communist
associations
,
was be%2:42:06::
one
of
the
architects
of
the
Morgenthau_Plan
,
which
had
it
ever
been
put put%2:35:05::
into
full
operation
,
would
have
simply
handed hand%2:40:00::
Germany
to
Stalin

One
item
in_this
unhappy
scheme
was be%2:42:06::
to
have have%2:30:00::
Germany
policed police%2:41:00::
exclusively
by
its
continental
neighbors
,
among
whom
only
the
Soviet_Union
possessed possess%2:42:00::
real
military
strength
.
It
is be%2:42:03::
quite
probable
,
however
,
that
stupidity
,
inexperience
and
childish
adherence
to
slogans
like
``
unconditional
surrender
''
had have%2:42:12::
more
to
do do%2:42:00::
with
the
unsatisfactory
settlements
at
the
end
of
the
war
than
treason
or
sympathy

Communism

Mr._Kennan
sums_up sum_up%2:32:00::

judgment

went_wrong go_wrong%2:41:00::

``
You
see see%2:31:01::

as
the
source

the
unshakeable
American
commitment
to
the
principle
of
unconditional

The
tendency

as

with

result
that

war
had
absolutely
to

.
Recognizing recognize%2:31:01::
that
there
could
have
been be%2:42:04::
no
effective
negotiated
peace
with
Hitler
,
he
points_out point_out%2:32:01::
the
shocking
failure
to
give give%2:40:03::
support
to
the
anti-Nazi
underground
,
which
very_nearly
eliminated eliminate%2:30:01::
Hitler
in
1944
.
A
veteran
diplomat
with
an
extraordinary
knowledge
of
Russian
language
,
history
and
literature
,
Kennan
recalls recall%2:31:00::
how
,
at_the_time
of
Hitler
's
attack
on
the
Soviet_Union
in
1941
,
he
penned pen%2:36:00::
a
private
note
to
a
State_Department
official
,
expressing express%2:32:01::
the
hope
that
``
never
would
we
associate associate%2:41:00::
ourselves
with
Russian
purposes
in
the
areas
of
eastern
Europe
beyond
her
own
boundaries
''
.
The
hope
was be%2:42:03::
vain
.
With
justified
bitterness
the
author
speaks speak%2:32:01::
of
``
what
seems seem%2:39:00::
to
me
to
have
been be%2:42:03::
an
inexcusable
body
of
ignorance
about
the
nature
of
the
Russian_Communist
movement
,
about
the
history
of
its
diplomacy
,
about
what
had
happened happen%2:30:00::
in
the
purges
,
and
about
what
had
been
going_on go_on%2:30:00::
in
Poland
and
the
Baltic_States
''
.
He
also
speaks speak%2:32:01::
of
Franklin_D._Roosevelt
's
``
puerile
''
assumption
that
``
if
only
he
(
Stalin
)
could
be
exposed expose%2:39:02::
to
the
persuasive
charm
of
someone
like
F._D._R.
himself
,
ideological
preconceptions
would
melt melt%2:30:04::
and
Russia
's
co-operation
with
the
West
could
be
easily
arranged arrange%2:36:03::
''
.
No
wonder
Khrushchev
's
first
message
to
President_Kennedy
was be%2:42:06::
a
wistful
desire
for
the
return
of
the
``
good
old
days
''
of
Roosevelt
.
This
fascinating
story
begins begin%2:42:00::
with
a
sketch
,
rich_in
personal
detail
,
of
the
glancing
mutual
impact
of
World_War
1
,
and
the
two
instalments
of
the
Russian_Revolution
.
The
first
of
these
involved involve%2:42:01::
the
replacement
of
the
Tsar
by
a
liberal
Provisional_Government
in
March
,
1917
;
the
second
,
the
seizure
of
power
by
the
Bolsheviks
(
who
later
called call%2:32:02::
themselves
Communists
)
in
November
of
the
same
year
.
As
Kennan
shows show%2:32:00::
,
the
judgment
of
the
Allied
governments
about
what
was
happening happen%2:30:00::
in
Russia
was
warped warp%2:32:00::
by
the
obsession
of
defeating defeat%2:33:00::
Germany
.
They
were be%2:42:03::
blind_to
the
evidence
that
nothing
could
keep keep%2:42:07::
the
Russian
people
fighting fight%2:33:00::
.
They
attributed attribute%2:31:00::
everything
that
went_wrong go_wrong%2:41:00::
in
Russia
to
German
influence
and
intrigue
.
This
,
more_than
any
other
factor
,
led lead%2:42:12::;2:41:12::
to
the
fiasco
of
Allied
intervention
.
As
the
author
very
justly
says say%2:32:00::
:
``
Had
a
world_war
not
been be%2:42:03::
in_progress
,
there
would
never
,
under
any
conceivable
stretch
of
the
imagination
,
have
been be%2:42:04::
an
Allied
intervention
in
North_Russia
''
.
The
scope
and
significance
of_this
intervention
have
been
grossly
exaggerated exaggerate%2:32:00::
by
Communist
propaganda
;
here
Kennan
,
operating operate%2:33:00::
with
precise
facts
and
figures
,
performs perform%2:41:02::
an
excellent
job
of
debunking
.
Of
many
passages
in
the
book
that
exemplify exemplify%2:42:00::
the
author
's
vivid
style
,
the
characterizations
of
the
two
plebeian
dictators
whose
crimes
make make%2:30:00::
those
of
crowned
autocrats
pale
by
comparison
may
be
selected select%2:31:00::
.
On
Stalin
:
``
This
was be%2:42:03::
a
man
of
incredible
criminality
,
of
a
criminality
effectively
without
limits
;
a
man
apparently
foreign
to
the
very
experience
of
love
,
without
mercy
or
pity
;
a
man
in
whose
entourage
none
was be%2:42:03::
ever
safe
;
a
man
whose
hand
was
set set%2:35:00::
against
all
that
could
not
be be%2:42:03::
useful
to
him
at
the
moment
;
a
man
who
was be%2:42:03::
most
dangerous
of
all
to
those
who
were be%2:42:03::
his
closest
collaborators
in
crime
''
.
And
here
is be%2:42:05::
Kennan
's
image
of
Hitler
,
Stalin
's
temporary
collaborator
in
the
subjugation
and
oppression
of
weaker
peoples
,
and
his
later
enemy
:
``
Behind
that
Charlie_Chaplin
moustache
and
that
truant
lock
of
hair
that
always
covered
his
forehead
,
behind
the
tirades
and
the
sulky
silences
,
the
passionate
orations
and
the
occasional
dull
evasive
stare
,
behind
the
prejudices
,
the
cynicism
,
the
total
amorality
of
behavior
,
behind
even
the
tendency
to
great
strategic
mistakes
,
there
lay lie%2:42:01::
a
statesman
of
no
mean
qualities
:
Shrewd
,
calculating
,
in
many
ways
realistic
,
endowed
-
like
Stalin
-
with
considerable
powers
of
dissimulation
,

cards
very

power

.
Two
criticisms
of_this
generally
admirable
and
fascinating
book
involve involve%2:42:01::
the
treatment
of
wartime
diplomacy
which
is be%2:42:03::
jagged
at
the
edges
-
there
is be%2:42:04::
no
mention
of
the
Potsdam_Conference
or
the
Morgenthau_Plan
.
And
in
a
concluding
chapter
about
America
's
stance
in
the
contemporary_world
,
one
senses sense%2:39:00::
certain
misplacements
of
emphasis
and
a
failure
to
come_to_grips come_to_grips%2:41:00::
with
the
baffling
riddle
of
our
time
:
How
to
deal deal%2:41:04::
with
a
wily
and
aggressive
enemy
without
appeasement
and
without
war
.
But
one
should
not
ask ask%2:32:01::
for
everything
.
Mr._Kennan
,
who
has
recently
abandoned abandon%2:31:00::
authorship
for
a
new
round
of
diplomacy
as
the
recently
appointed
American
ambassador
to
Yugoslavia
,
is be%2:42:03::
not
the
only
man
who
finds find%2:31:10::
it
easier
to
portray portray%2:32:00::
the
past
than
to
prescribe prescribe%2:32:00::
for
the
future
.
The
story
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
of
Soviet-Western
relations
is be%2:42:03::
vitally
important
,
and
it
is
told tell%2:32:01::
with
the
fire
of
a
first-rate
historical
narrator
.
The
Ireland
we
usually
hear hear%2:31:00::
about
in
the
theater
is be%2:42:03::
a
place
of
bitter
political
or
domestic
unrest
,
lightened
occasionally
with
flashes
of
native
wit
and
charm
.
In
``
Donnybrook
''
,
there
is be%2:42:04::
quite
a
different
Eire
,
a
rural
land
where
singing
,
dancing
,
fist-fighting
and
romancing
are be%2:42:02::
the
thing
.
There
is be%2:42:00::
plenty
of
violence

to_be_sure
,
but
it
is be%2:42:03::
a
nice
violence

no

gets
killed kill%2:35:00::
