I
was
giving
the
parked
cars
the
once-over

The
Oldsmobile
with
the
license_number
JYJ
114
was be%2:42:05::
in
stall
number

.
``
Okay

,
I
said say%2:32:00::
to
the

,
``

.
I
walked walk%2:38:00::
with
him
back
to
the
entrance
.
He
gave give%2:40:00::
me
a
ticket
on
the
agency
car
and
parked park%2:35:00::
it
.
I
was be%2:42:03::
back
in
ten
minutes

``
Forgot forget%2:31:03::

,
I
told tell%2:32:00::
him
,
showing show%2:39:02::
him
my
ticket
.
He
started start%2:30:00::
to
say say%2:32:00::
something
as
I
walked walk%2:38:00::
in
and_then
suddenly
grinned grin%2:29:00::
and
said say%2:32:00::
,
``
Oh
,
yes

You
're be%2:42:06::

him

He
consulted consult%2:32:01::
the

then
looked look%2:39:00::
at
a
notation

said say%2:32:00::

?
``
Sure

,
I
told tell%2:32:04::
him
.
I
went_back go_back%2:38:00::
to
the
agency
car
and
got_out get_out%2:35:00::
an
electric
bug
,
one
of
the
newest
devices
for
electronic
shadowing
.
I
always
keep keep%2:40:00::
a
set
in
the
car

I
put_in put_in%2:30:00::
new
batteries

be be%2:42:03::
certain
I
'd
have have%2:40:00::
plenty
of
power
and
on
my
way_out
walked walk%2:38:00::
over
to
the
regular
parking
stalls
and
stood stand%2:35:00::
looking look%2:39:00::
at
them
thoughtfully
.
I
waited wait%2:42:01::
until
the
parking
attendant
was be%2:42:03::
busy
with
a
customer
,
then
slipped slip%2:38:01::
around
the
back
of
the
car
with
license_number
JYM
114
,
attached attach%2:35:01::
the
electronic
bug
to_the_rear
bumper
and
walked_out walk_out%2:38:00::
.
The
attendant
waved wave%2:32:00::
me
on
.
One
of
the
hardest
chores
a
detective
has have%2:40:00::
is be%2:42:06::
hanging_around hang_around%2:42:00::
on
a
city
street
,
trying try%2:41:00::
to
make make%2:30:00::
himself
inconspicuous
,
keeping_an_eye_on keep_an_eye_on%2:39:00::
the
entrance
of
an
office_building
and
waiting wait%2:42:00::
.
For
the
first
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
it
's be%2:42:03::
possible
to
be be%2:42:03::
more_or_less
interested
in
window
displays
,
then
in
people
passing_by pass_by%2:38:00::
.
After
a
while
,
however
,
a
person
's
mind
gets get%2:30:00::
fed_up
and
that
magnifies magnify%2:30:00::
all_of
the
disagreeable
physical
symptoms
which
go_with go_with%2:42:01::
that
sort_of
an
assignment

You
want want%2:34:00::
to
sit_down sit_down%2:38:00::

Your
leg
muscles
and
back
muscles
feel feel%2:29:00::

You

conscious_of
the
fact
that
your
feet
hurt hurt%2:39:00::
,
that
the
city

hard

I
waited wait%2:42:00::
a
solid
two
hours
before
my
man
came_out come_out%2:30:00::
of
the
office_building
.
He
came_out come_out%2:30:00::

I
hurried hurry%2:38:00::
over
to
the
agency
heap
,
jumped jump%2:38:00::
in
,
started start%2:30:01::
the
motor
and
was be%2:42:03::
just_in_time

see see%2:39:00::
the
car
I
wanted want%2:37:00::

shadow shadow%2:38:00::
turn turn%2:38:03::
to

I
was
held_up hold_up%2:30:00::
a_bit
trying try%2:41:00::
to

a
left
turn

By
the
time
I
'd
made make%2:41:00::
it
he
was be%2:42:03::
gone

Traffic
was be%2:42:03::
pretty
heavy

I
turned_on turn_on%2:35:00::
the
electric
bug
,
and
the
signal
came_in come_in%2:38:01::
loud
and
clear
.
I
made
time
and
picked pick_up%2:38:00::
him
up
within
ten
blocks
.
I
stayed stay%2:30:00::
half
a
block
behind
him
,
letting let%2:41:00::
lots_of
cars
keep keep%2:42:07::
in
between
us
,
listening listen%2:39:00::
to
the
steady
beep
beep
beep
.
After
fifteen
minutes
of
traffic
driving
he
turned turn%2:38:00::
to
the
left
.
I
could
n't
see see%2:39:00::
him
,
but
the
electric
bugging
device
gave give%2:40:05::
steady
beeps
when
it
was be%2:42:05::
straight
ahead
,
short
half
beeps
when
the
car
I
was
following follow%2:38:00::
was be%2:42:05::
to
the
left
,
and
long
drawn-out
beeps
when
it
turned turn%2:38:00::
to
the
right
.
If
it
ever
got get%2:30:00::
behind
me
,
the
beep
turned turn%2:42:00::
to
a
buzz
.
I
turned turn%2:38:00::
left
too_soon
and
got get%2:40:00::
a
signal
showing show%2:39:02::
that
I
was be%2:42:05::
still
behind
him
but
he
was be%2:42:05::
to
the
right
.
After
a
while
the
signal
became become%2:42:01::
a
buzz
and
I
knew know%2:31:02::
he
was be%2:42:05::
behind
me
.
That
meant mean%2:42:00::
he
'd
parked park%2:35:00::
someplace
.
I
made
a
big
circle
until
I
located locate%2:40:00::
the
car
parked park%2:35:00::
at
the
curb
in_front
of
an
apartment
house
.
I
found find%2:40:02::
a
parking
place
half
a
block
away
,
sat sit%2:35:00::
in
the
car
and
waited wait%2:42:00::
.
My
quarry
was be%2:42:05::
in
the
apartment
house
for
two
hours
.
Then
he
came_out come_out%2:30:00::
and
started start%2:30:00::
driving drive%2:38:01::
toward
the
beach
.
By
this
time
it
was be%2:42:03::
dark
.
I
could
get get%2:30:00::
up
close_to
him
where
there
was be%2:42:04::
traffic
but
had have%2:42:05::
to
drop drop_behind%2:38:00::
far
behind
when
there
was be%2:42:04::
n't
traffic
.
My
lights
would
have
been be%2:42:06::
a
giveaway
if
I
'd
tried try%2:41:00::
to
shadow shadow%2:38:00::
him
in
the
conventional
manner
.
Moreover
,
I
'd
have
lost lose%2:40:01::
him
if
it
had
n't
been be%2:42:03::
for
the
electronic
shadowing
device
.
His
signal
was
coming come%2:38:02::
loud
and
clear
and_then
all_of_a_sudden
it
turned turn%2:42:00::
to
a
buzz
.
I
circled circle%2:38:01::
the
block
and
found find%2:39:02::
he
was be%2:42:05::
in
the
parking_lot
of
a
high-class
restaurant
.
I
sat sit%2:35:00::
where
I
could
watch watch%2:41:00::
the
exit
and
realized realize%2:31:01::
I
was be%2:42:03::
hungry
.
I
sat sit%2:35:00::
there
with
the
faint
odor
of
charcoal-broiled
steaks
tantalizing tantalize%2:32:00::
my
nostrils
and
occasionally
catching catch%2:39:01::
the
aroma
of
coffee
.
My
man
came_out come_out%2:30:00::
an
hour
later
,
drove drive%2:38:01::
to
the
beach
,
turned turn%2:38:00::
right
and
after
half
a
mile
went go%2:38:00::
to
the
Swim
and
Tan_Motel
.
It
was be%2:42:06::
a
fairly
modern
motel
with
quite
a_bit
of
electrical
display
in_front
.
I
remembered remember%2:31:00::
it
was be%2:42:06::
the
Peeping_Tom
place
.
I
waited wait%2:42:00::
until
my
man
was
coming_out come_out%2:30:00::
of
the
office
with
the
key
to
a
cabin
before
I
went_in go_in%2:38:00::
to
register register%2:41:01::
.
The
card
the
man
I
was
shadowing shadow%2:38:00::
had
filled_out fill_out%2:32:00::
was be%2:42:05::
still
on
the
counter
.
I
noticed notice%2:39:00::
that
he
was be%2:42:05::
in
Unit
12
and
that
he
had
registered register%2:41:00::
under
the
name
of
Oscar_L._Palmer
and
wife
,
giving give%2:40:07::
a
San_Francisco
address
.
He
had
written write%2:32:00::
out
the
license_number
of
his
car
but
had
transposed transpose%2:30:00::
the
last
two
figures
,
an
old
dodge
which
is be%2:42:03::
still
good
.
Ninety-nine
times_out
of
a_hundred
the
motel
manager
does
n't
check check%2:41:04::
the
license_number
on
the
plates
against
the
license_number
the
tenant
writes write%2:32:00::
out
.
If
he
does
,
it
's
still
better
than
an
even_chance
he
won
n't
notice notice%2:39:04::
the
transposition
of
the
numbers
,
and
if
he
should
notice notice%2:39:04::
it
,
the
thing
can
be
passed_off pass_off%2:39:00::
as
an
honest
mistake
.
I
used use%2:34:01::
the
alias
of
Robert_C._Richards
,
gave give%2:40:07::
the
first
three
letters
and
the
first_and_last
figure
of
the
license_number
on
the
agency
heap
,
but
a_couple_of
phony
numbers
in_between
.
I
could
have
written write%2:32:00::
anything
.
The
manager
of
the
motel
was be%2:42:06::
a
woman
who
apparently
did
n't
care care%2:37:02::
.
She
was
complying comply%2:42:00::
with
the
law
in
regard_to
registrations
but
she
certainly
was
n't
checking check%2:41:04::
license_numbers
or
bothering bother%2:37:00::
the
tenants
.
``
You
mean mean%2:32:01::

?
``

``

``
Any

I
asked ask%2:32:00::

``

she
said say%2:32:00::
smiling smile%2:29:00::
.
``

``
Thank_you

I
told tell%2:32:04::
her
.
I
took take%2:41:04::
another
sidelong
glance
at
the
other
registration
card
,
then
took take%2:35:00::
the
key
to
Unit
13
that
she
had
given give%2:40:00::
me
and
went_down go_down%2:38:02::
long
enough
to
park park%2:35:00::
the
car
.
The
construction
was be%2:42:03::
reasonably
solid
;
not
like
the
cracker-box
construction
of
so
many_of
the
motel
units
that
have have%2:42:00::
stucco
all_over
the
outside
but
walls
that
are be%2:42:03::
thin
enough
so
you
can
hear hear%2:39:00::
every
movement
of
the
people
in
the
adjoining
apartment
.
I
put put%2:35:00::
a
small
electric
amplifier
against
the
wall
on_the_side
I
wanted want%2:37:00::
to
case case%2:39:00::

With
the
aid
of_that
I
could
hear hear%2:39:00::
my
man
moving move%2:38:03::
around
,
heard hear%2:39:00::
him
cough cough%2:29:00::
a_couple_of
times

heard hear%2:39:00::
the
toilet
flush flush%2:30:00::

He
did

I
was be%2:42:03::
so
hungry
my
stomach
felt feel%2:39:00::
all
