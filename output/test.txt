That
's
what
the
man
had
said
.
Haney
peered
doubtfully
at
his
drinking
companion
through
bleary
,
tear-filled
eyes
.
He
had
no
ready
answer
,
as
much
from
surprise
as
from
the
fit
of
coughing
.
Was
the
man
drunk
or
crazy
or
both
?
?
But
his
new-found
buddy
had
matched
him
drink
for
drink
until
he
lost
count
,
and
the
man
's
eyes
were
still
clear
.
The
guy
is
off
his
rocker
,
Haney
thought
to
himself
0
,
and
looked
from
those
eyes
.
Eyes
that
were
clear
,
but
also
bright
with
a
strange
intensity
,
a
sort
of
cold
fire
burning
behind
them
.
Why
had
n't
he
noticed
it
before
?
?
No
,
the
man
was
not
drunk
He
wondered
how
he
got
tied
up
with
this
stranger
.
But
,
course
,
he
remembered
now
.
It
was
blurred
,
after
two
hours
of
steady
drinking
,
but
the
occasion
of
it
came
to
him
.
The
stranger
,
his
head
seemingly
sunk
in
thought
,
started
to
cross
the
street
against
the
light
just
as
a
huge
moving
roared
through
the
intersection
.
Brakes
howled
and
a
horn
blared
furiously
,
but
the
man
would
have
been
hit
if
Phil
had
n't
called
to
him
a
second
before
.
His
shout
had
been
involuntary
,
something
0
anybody
might
have
done
without
thinking
,
spur
.
matter
,
he
would
n't
have
cared
at
all
if
the
guy
had
been
hit
.
Actually
,
he
regretted
having
opened
his
mouth
when
the
truck
came
a
stop
and
the
angry
driver
jumped
down
from
the
cab
and
walked
back
toward
them
.
By
then
,
the
stranger
was
thanking
Haney
profusely
and
had
one
arm
around
his
shoulders
as
if
he
were
an
old
friend
.
So
the
driver
started
to
curse
at
both
of
them
as
if
they
had
been
in
a
plot
together
to
ruin
his
safe-driving
record
.
Then
the
man
0
he
saved
turned
and
looked
squarely
into
the
truck
's
face
,
without
saying
a
word
.
Very
suddenly
,
the
driver
stopped
swearing
at
them
,
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
to
his
truck
.
Haney
had
n't
given
it
much
thought
at
the
time
.
Now
he
recalled
it
very
clearly
,
and
wondered
what
the
truck
driver
had
seen
in
those
eyes
to
make
him
back
off
.
It
must
have
been
the
sort
of
look
that
can
call
a
bluff
without
saying
a
word
.
When
the
light
went
their
way
,
they
went
across
the
street
.
And
when
the
stranger
found
that
Phil
was
way
to
one
of
his
favorite
bars
,
he
insisted
on
offering
to
buy
drinks
for
both
of
them
.
Phil
usually
went
alone
and
kept
,
sitting
in
a
corner
and
passing
the
time
by
nursing
his
favorite
grudges
.
But
he
decided
0
he
would
n't
mind
company
return
for
free
drinks
,
even
though
he
made
good
money
at
his
job
.
Phil
was
like
that
.
Now
he
wondered
if
it
was
worth
it
,
having
a
screwball
for
company
.
He
really
did
n't
take
the
offer
seriously
,
but
he
began
to
feel
uneasy
.
When
he
finally
got
the
coughing
control
,
he
realized
that
Pete
-LRB-
all
0
he
gave
was
his
name
-RRB-
was
still
waiting
for
an
answer
--
he
did
n't
even
seem
to
wink
as
he
continued
to
stare
.
Haney
managed
a
weak
laugh
.
''
Guess
0
I
ca
n't
think
of
anyone
,
Pete
.
Thanks
anyhow
''
.
A
faint
crease
appeared
between
the
man
's
eyebrows
.
''
I
think
0
you
are
n't
taking
me
seriously
,
Phil
.
I
meant
it
.
And
everybody
has
some
kind
of
grudge
.
I
might
have
got
hit
by
that
truck
if
it
was
n't
for
you
.
I
believe
returning
favors
.
I
'll
do
anything
for
somebody
0
I
like
.
It
wo
n't
cost
you
a
cent
,
Phil
.
Go
and
try
me
''
!
!
Phil
rubbed
his
forehead
wearily
.
He
was
beginning
to
feel
woolly
.
Maybe
it
would
be
better
to
humor
the
guy
and
then
make
an
exit
.
He
really
did
n't
expect
anything
to
come
of
it
,
and
there
were
a
few
people
''
right
''
,
he
conceded
finally
0
,
''
if
you
must
know
,
I
do
n't
get
the
landlord
.
He
keeps
riding
me
because
I
like
to
listen
to
the
radio
and
sing
while
I
'm
taking
a
bath
.
He
says
0
the
neighbors
complain
,
but
I
do
n't
believe
it
.
Why
do
n't
they
tell
me
themselves
if
it
bothers
them
''
?
?
The
man
closed
his
eyes
and
nodded
.
When
he
looked
up
again
,
he
seemed
almost
contented
.
''
Fine
.
Give
me
your
address
.
It
will
take
little
time
.
I
want
to
study
your
landlord
's
habits
and
movements
first
.
You
see
,
I
always
make
it
look
like
an
accident
.
Maybe
suicide
,
if
it
looks
reasonable
.
In
that
way
there
's
no
trouble
for
the
customer
''
.
Haney
's
eyebrows
flew
up
.
''
Customer
''
?
?
Pete
smiled
modestly
.
''
It
's
my
line
''
,
he
said
Five
minutes
later
,
before
Haney
could
make
his
break
,
the
stranger
stood
and
nodded
farewell
.
Haney
watched
the
small
but
wiry
man
slip
out
the
door
quickly
and
silently
,
and
felt
relieved
to
see
that
nobody
else
seemed
to
notice
his
departure
.
Phil
decided
to
stay
a
little
longer
,
and
as
time
passed
it
seemed
as
if
the
strange
little
man
had
never
been
there
,
but
for
the
other
glass
on
the
table
.
Some
time
before
midnight
he
returned
to
his
apartment
and
hit
,
putting
the
whole
incident
out
of
mind
before
he
fell
.
The
next
day
,
Sunday
,
the
hangover
reminded
Haney
where
he
had
been
the
night
before
.
The
hangover
turn
reminded
him
of
his
conversation
with
the
weirdy
,
and
he
groaned
.
He
went
for
more
aspirin
later
in
the
day
,
and
passed
the
surly
landlord
way
--
he
was
still
alive
and
scowling
usual
,
as
if
tenants
were
a
burden
in
his
life
.
Phil
shrugged
and
ignored
him
.
He
went
to
work
Monday
.
By
Wednesday
the
landlord
was
still
alive
.
course
On
Thursday
,
Haney
mailed
the
monthly
check
for
separate
maintenance
to
his
wife
Lolly
,
and
wished
0
the
stranger
could
do
something
about
her
Coming
home
from
work
,
he
was
startled
to
see
a
police
car
parked
in
front
of
the
apartment
building
.
Inside
the
lobby
,
people
were
standing
around
,
talking
excitedly
.
His
spine
crawled
with
a
foreboding
premonition
as
he
asked
one
of
his
fellow
tenants
what
had
happened
.
The
landlord
had
died
.
Late
that
afternoon
,
it
seemed
,
he
had
fallen
off
the
roof
while
on
some
obscure
errand
or
inspection
.
He
had
apparently
been
alone
.
Nobody
witnessed
the
fall
--
just
the
sickening
impact
when
his
body
smashed
on
the
pavement
just
outside
the
basement
delivery
entrance
.
Haney
hoped
that
nobody
noticed
his
sudden
pallor
,
as
he
felt
the
blood
drain
from
his
cheeks
.
He
muttered
something
about
how
terrible
it
was
,
and
walked
with
deliberate
slowness
to
the
elevator
.
Once
inside
his
apartment
,
he
poured
a
drink
with
trembling
hands
and
flopped
limply
in
a
chair
.
After
a
while
he
began
to
feel
better
about
it
,
especially
when
no
one
bothered
to
ask
any
questions
.
But
after
all
,
why
should
they
?
?
Still
later
,
he
finally
convinced
himself
that
it
was
an
accident
--
just
a
coincidence
.
The
stranger
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
of
course
Haney
went
,
happy
that
at
least
he
was
rid
of
that
lousy
landlord
.
After
all
,
the
man
had
no
family
,
so
no
one
suffered
,
and
everybody
was
better
off
for
it
.
Really
,
he
said
to
himself
,
nobody
kills
a
man
just
as
a
favor
!
!
So
you
thought
0
I
did
n't
mean
what
I
said
.
The
stranger
's
eyes
were
large
and
sad
,
as
if
Phil
Haney
had
hurt
his
feelings
.
It
was
like
a
recurrent
,
annoying
dream
,
but
now
the
dream
was
beginning
to
take
overtones
of
a
nightmare
.
However
,
Haney
knew
0
it
was
not
a
dream
.
He
might
be
very
tight
,
but
he
knew
where
he
was
.
It
was
the
same
bar
,
and
it
was
two
weeks
later
--
Saturday
night
,
when
he
had
an
excuse
to
drink
heavier
than
usual
.
He
had
been
sitting
in
the
usual
corner
at
the
little
table
,
possible
from
any
talkative
,
friendly
lushes
.
He
was
enjoying
the
weekly
ritual
of
washing
his
pet
grievance
with
bourbon
slightly
moistened
with
water
.
This
favorite
grievance
was
not
the
landlord
.
He
had
already
quite
forgotten
about
him
.
fact
,
he
had
only
mentioned
him
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
.
His
real
grievance
was
Lolly
.
Toward
the
end
of
his
fourth
hairy
highball
,
while
he
was
moodily
making
wet
rings
on
the
table-top
with
the
bottom
of
the
glass
,
he
became
aware
that
he
was
not
alone
.
He
looked
up
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
beheld
the
stranger
sitting
across
the
table
,
smiling
a
secret
smile
at
him
,
as
if
they
were
fellow
conspirators
.
He
had
n't
even
noticed
--
what
was
his
name
?
?
Pete
?
?
--
he
had
n't
seen
him
sit
.
The
man
was
uncanny
,
like
a
shadow
,
and
made
as
much
noise
as
a
shadow
.
Haney
felt
shrinking
sight
,
but
he
was
already
trapped
in
the
corner
with
the
wiry
,
dark
little
man
.
He
began
to
wish
that
he
had
n't
shouted
that
other
evening
when
the
truck
bore
through
the
crossing
.
Was
he
going
to
be
saddled
from
now
on
with
a
creep
for
a
bar-buddy
?
?
He
'd
have
to
start
going
to
some
of
the
other
places
again
.
In
a
low
voice
,
almost
whispering
,
the
man
had
asked
Phil
if
he
was
happy
with
the
way
the
landlord
had
been
taken
his
back
.
He
made
the
mistake
of
answering
in
an
offhand
way
,
and
instantly
realized
that
his
skepticism
must
have
showed
in
his
face
or
voice
.
Pete
frowned
slightly
,
then
became
sad
and
moody
.
Haney
did
n't
want
to
encourage
his
company
,
but
felt
0
he
ought
to
buy
him
a
drink
anyhow
,
to
prevent
possible
trouble
.
But
there
was
no
trouble
.
The
guy
sulked
over
his
drink
,
obviously
upset
by
Haney
's
lack
of
appreciation
.
To
break
the
uncomfortable
silence
,
Haney
began
to
talk
.
time
,
and
two
drinks
later
,
he
was
complaining
bitterly
about
his
wife
,
He
was
on
the
subject
for
ten
minutes
or
so
when
he
noticed
the
renewed
interest
in
his
listener
--
it
showed
in
the
alert
face
and
the
suddenly
bright
eyes
.
When
he
paused
to
moisten
his
throat
,
the
stranger
broke
.
''
But
why
pay
her
bills
?
?
If
she
runs
with
other
men
,
and
if
you
hate
her
as
you
say
,
why
not
just
divorce
her
''
?
?
Haney
scowled
.
''
That
bitch
would
love
a
divorce
''
,
he
growled
.
''
Then
she
'd
get
half
of
everything
0
I
have
.
Community
deal
--
you
know
.
I
'd
have
to
sell
my
business
to
pay
her
with
her
share
.
She
can
drop
''
!
!
Pete
nodded
understandingly
.
''
Oh
yes
.
Now
I
see
.
You
must
understand
,
I
have
n't
been
in
this
state
too
long
.
I
came
out
here
to
retire
.
That
's
why
I
--
why
I
do
a
free
job
now
and
then
.
You
should
have
told
me
about
her
before
''
.
Haney
felt
a
twinge
of
annoyance
when
he
heard
the
now
familiar
line
again
.
Then
a
wild
thought
ran
circles
through
his
clouded
brain
.
Suppose
--
just
suppose
0
this
guy
was
really
what
he
said
0
he
was
T
!
!
A
retired
professional
killer
If
he
was
just
a
nut
,
no
harm
was
done
.
But
if
he
was
the
real
,
he
could
do
something
about
Lolly
.
He
felt
very
cunning
,
very
proud
of
himself
as
he
played
on
the
other
man
's
soft
.
''
No
offense
intended
''
,
he
said
gently
.
''
But
it
's
just
that
--
well
,
you
know
.
The
cops
did
n't
suspect
a
thing
,
and
I
thought
0
it
was
a
coincidence
.
After
all
,
I
did
n't
know
you
,
Pete
.
It
could
have
been
an
accident
''
.
He
shrugged
casually
.
''
But
if
you
say
0
you
managed
it
''
The
stranger
was
hooked
.
His
eyes
burned
feverishly
.
''
Yes
,
yes
''
,
he
muttered
impatiently
.
''
course
it
looked
like
an
accident
.
I
always
work
it
that
way
--
and
always
at
a
time
when
the
customer
has
an
alibi
.
Let
me
prove
it
,
Phil
.
I
think
0
I
can
manage
one
more
favor
for
you
''
.
He
waited
eagerly
.
Haney
swished
the
liquor
in
the
bottom
of
his
glass
.
Tuesday
's
rout
of
a
GOP
congressional
hopeful
in
a
Mississippi
district
that
has
n't
backed
a
Democratic
presidential
candidate
since
Adlai
Stevenson
is
another
reminder
that
,
at
least
at
the
federal
level
,
political
''
ticket
splitting
''
has
been
on
the
rise
over
the
past
half
.
In
only
one
presidential
election
year
prior
to
1948
did
more
than
20
%
of
the
nation
's
congressional
districts
choose
a
different
party
's
candidate
for
the
White
House
than
for
the
House
of
Representatives
.
Now
that
percentage
routinely
equals
a
third
and
twice
has
been
above
40
%
.
As
we
know
,
voters
tend
to
favor
Republicans
more
in
races
for
president
than
in
those
for
Congress
.
In
every
presidential
election
over
the
past
half
,
except
for
the
Goldwater
presidential
candidacy
,
the
GOP
has
captured
a
greater
percentage
of
the
major-party
popular
vote
for
president
than
it
has
of
congressional
seats
or
the
popular
vote
for
Congress
.
Prior
to
1932
,
the
pattern
was
nearly
the
opposite
.
What
accounts
for
the
results
of
recent
decades
?
A
simple
economic
theory
may
provide
at
least
a
partial
explanation
for
the
split
displayed
by
Americans
in
the
voting
.
The
theory
relies
on
three
assumptions
:
1
-RRB-
Voters
can
''
buy
''
one
of
two
brands
when
they
select
their
political
agents
--
a
Republican
brand
that
believes
in
the
minimalist
state
and
in
the
virtues
of
private
markets
over
the
vices
of
public
action
,
and
a
Democratic
brand
that
believes
in
big
government
and
in
public
intervention
to
remedy
the
excesses
attendant
to
the
pursuit
of
private
interest
.
2
-RRB-
Congressional
representatives
have
two
basic
responsibilities
while
voting
in
office
--
dealing
with
national
issues
-LRB-
programmatic
actions
such
casting
roll
votes
on
legislation
that
imposes
costs
and\/or
confers
benefits
on
the
population
large
-RRB-
and
attending
to
local
issues
-LRB-
constituency
service
and
pork

Republican
congressional
representatives
,
because
of
their
belief
in
a
minimalist
state
,
are
less
willing
to
engage
in
local
benefit-seeking
than
are
Democratic
members
of
Congress
.
If
these
assumptions
hold
,
voters
in
races
for
Congress
face
what
in
economic
theory
is
called
a
prisoner
's
dilemma
and
have
an
incentive
,
at
the
margin
,
to
lean
Democratic
.
If
they
put
a
Republican
into
office
,
not
only
will
they
acquire
less
terms
local
benefits
but
their
selected
legislator
will
be
relatively
powerless
to
prevent
other
legislators
from
''
bringing
home
the
bacon
''
to
their
respective
constituencies
.
Each
legislator
,
after
all
,
is
only
one
out
of
535
when
it
comes
to
national
policy
making
.
In
races
for
the
White
House
,
a
voter
's
incentive
,
at
the
margin
,
is
to
lean
Republican
.
Although
a
GOP
president
may
limit
local
benefits
to
the
voter
's
particular
district/state
,
such
a
president
is
also
likely
to
be
more
effective
at
preventing
other
districts/states
and
their
legislators
from
bringing
the
local
benefits
.
The
individual
voter
's
standing
consequently
will
be
enhanced
through
lower
taxes
.
While
this
theory
is
exceedingly
simple
,
it
appears
to
explain
several
things
.
First
,
why
ticket
splitting
has
increased
and
taken
the
peculiar
pattern
that
it
has
over
the
past
half
:
Prior
to
the
election
of
Franklin
Roosevelt
as
president
and
the
advent
of
the
New
Deal
,
government
occupied
a
much
smaller
role
in
society
and
the
prisoner
's
dilemma
problem
confronting
voters
in
races
for
Congress
was
considerably
less
severe
.
Second
,
it
explains
why
voters
hold
Congress
in
disdain
but
generally
love
their
own
congressional
representatives
:
Any
individual
legislator
's
constituents
appreciate
the
specific
benefits
that
the
legislator
wins
for
them
but
not
the
overall
cost
associated
with
every
other
legislator
doing
likewise
for
his
own
constituency
.
Third
,
the
theory
suggests
why
legislators
who
pay
too
much
to
national
policy
making
relative
to
local
benefit-seeking
have
lower
security
in
office
.
example
,
first-term
members
of
the
House
,
once
the
most
vulnerable
of
incumbents
,
have
become
virtually
immune
to
defeat
.
The
one
exception
to
this
recent
trend
was
the
defeat
of
13
of
the
52
freshman
Republicans
brought
into
office
in
1980
by
the
Reagan
revolution
and
running
for
re-election
in
1982
.
Because
these
freshmen
placed
far
more
emphasis
on
their
partisan
role
--
spreading
the
Reagan
revolution
--
in
national
policy
making
,
they
were
more
vulnerable
to
defeat
.
Fourth
,
the
theory
indicates
why
the
Republican
Party
may
have
a
difficult
time
attracting
viable
candidates
for
congressional
office
.
Potential
candidates
may
be
discouraged
from
running
less
by
the
congressional
salary
than
by
the
prospect
of
defeat
at
the
hands
of
a
Democratic
opponent
.
To
the
extent
that
potential
Republican
candidates
and
their
financial
backers
realize
that
the
congressional
prisoner
's
dilemma
game
works
to
their
disadvantage
,
the
Republican
Party
will
be
hindered
in
its
attempts
to
field
a
competitive
slate
of
congressional
candidates
.
Fifth
,
the
theory
may
provide
at
least
a
partial
reason
for
why
ticket
splitting
has
been
particularly
pronounced
in
the
South
.
To
the
extent
that
Democratic
legislators
from
the
South
have
held
a
disproportionate
share
of
power
in
Congress
since
1932
and
have
been
able
to
translate
such
clout
into
relatively
more
local
benefits
for
their
respective
constituencies
,
voters
in
the
South
have
had
an
especially
strong
incentive
to
keep
such
Democrats
in
office
.
Finally
,
the
theory
suggests
why
Republicans
generally
have
fared
better
in
Senate
races
than
in
campaigns
for
the
House
.
Since
local
benefit-seeking
matters
more
and
national
policy
making
matters
less
in
the
lower
chamber
of
Congress
,
this
is
precisely
the
pattern
0
one
would
expect
if
Republicans
are
less
willing
to
engage
in
local
benefit-seeking
than
their
Democratic
counterparts
.
Is
there
any
empirical
support
for
this
theory
?
Three
pieces
of
evidence
corroborate
the
key
assumption
that
Democratic
legislators
are
more
willing
to
engage
in
local
benefit-seeking
than
their
Republican
colleagues
.
First
,
economists
James
Bennett
and
Thomas
DiLorenzo
find
that
GOP
senators
turn
roughly
10
%
more
of
their
allocated
personal
staff
budgets
than
Democrats
do
.
To
the
extent
that
the
primary
duty
of
personal
staff
involves
local
benefit-seeking
,
this
indicates
that
political
philosophy
leads
congressional
Republicans
to
pay
less
to
narrow
constituent
concerns
.
Second
,
if
the
key
assumption
is
valid
,
Democrats
should
have
lower
attendance
rates
on
roll-call
votes
than
Republicans
do
to
the
extent
that
such
votes
reflect
national
policy
making
and
that
participating
in
such
votes
takes
from
the
time
0
a
legislator
could
otherwise
devote
to
local
benefit-seeking
.
This
is
indeed
what
the
data
indicate
,
particularly
in
the
case
of
the
House
.
The
Democratic
House
attendance
rate
has
not
exceeded
the
Republican
House
attendance
rate
since
1959
.
Finally
,
as
shown
in
the
table
,
Democrats
allocate
a
higher
proportion
of
their
personal
staffs
to
district
offices
--
where
local
benefit-seeking
duties
matter
more
and
national
policy
making
activities
matter
less
relative
to
Washington
offices
.

examination
of
changes
in
personal
staffing
decisions
in
the
Senate
between
1986
and
1987
-LRB-
when
control
of
that
body
changed

hands
-RRB-
,
moreover
,
reveals
that
the
personal
staffing
differences
noted
in
the
table
can
not
be
attributed
to
the
disproportionate
control
0
Democrats
exercise
,
due
their
majority-party
status
,
over
other
resources
such
committee
staff
.
An
additional
piece
of
evidence
from
the
Senate
:
Holding
other
factors
constant
,
such
incumbency
advantages
and
regional
factors
,
the
difference
between
popular
votes
for
Republican
presidential
and
senatorial
candidates
in
states
conducting
a
Senate
election
turns
to
be
a
positive
function
of
how
onerous
the
federal
's
tax
burden
is
per
state
-LRB-
a
progressive
tax
hits
higher-income
states
harder
-RRB-
.
Put
more
simply
,
GOP
candidates
for
president
are
looked
more
kindly
by
voters
than
Republican
candidates
for
the
Senate
when
the
prisoner
's
dilemma
is
more
severe
.
Moreover
,
ticket
splitting
appears
to
take
the
same
peculiar
pattern
at
the
state
government
level
as
it
does
at
the
federal
level
.
State
government
is
more
typically
split
along
Republican-governor/Democratic-legislature
lines
than
the
reverse
.
A
cross-state
econometric
investigation
,
furthermore
,
reveals
that
,
holding
other
factors
constant
,
the
difference
between
a
state
's
major-party
vote
going
to
the
Republican
gubernatorial
candidate
and
the
Republican
share
of
the
lower
state
house
is
a
positive
function
of
the
state
tax
.
In
sum
,
at
both
the
federal
and
state
government
levels
at
least
part
of
the
seemingly
irrational
behavior
0
voters
display
in
the
voting
may
have
an
exceedingly
rational
explanation

HLR
:
Judy
and
I
were
in
our
back
when
the
lawn
started
rolling
like
ocean
waves
.
We
ran
into
the
house
to
get
Mame
,
but
the
next
tremor
threw
me
in
the
air
and
bounced
me
as
I
tried
to
get
to
my
feet
.
We
are
all
fine
here
,
although
Mame
was
extremely
freaked
.
Kitchen
full
of
broken
crystal
.
Books
and
tapes
all
over
my
room
.
Not
one
thing
in
the
house
is
where
it
is
supposed
to
be
,
but
the
structure
is
fine
.
While
I
was
standing
on
the
lawn
with
Mame
,
waiting
for
another
tremor
,
I
noticed
that
all
the
earthworms
were
emerging
from
the
ground
and
slithering
across
the
lawn
!

It
's
amazing
how
one
second
can
so
completely
change
your
life
.

FIG
:
I
guess
0
we
're
all
living
very
tentatively
here
,
waiting
for
the
expected
but
dreaded
aftershock
.
It
's
hard
to
accept
that
it
's
over
and
only
took
15
seconds
.
I
wonder
when
we
'll
be
able
to
relax
.

PANDA
:
Flesh
goes
to
total
alert
for
flight
or
fight
.
Nausea
seems
a
commonplace
symptom
.
Berkeley
very
quiet
right
now
.
I
walked
along
Shattuck
between
Delaware
and
Cedar
at
a
few
minutes
before
eight
this
morning
.
Next
to
Chez
Panisse
a
homeless
couple
,
bundled
into
a
blue
sleeping
,
sat
,
said
,
''
Good
''
and
then
the
woman
smiled
,
said
,
''
Is
n't
it
great
just
to
be
alive
?
''
I
agreed
.
It
is
.
Great
.
