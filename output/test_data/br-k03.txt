Mickie
sat
over
his
second
whisky-on-the-rocks
in
a
little
bar
next
to
the
funeral_parlor
on
Pennsylvania_Avenue
.
Al_'s_Little_Cafe
was
small
,
dark
,
narrow
,
and
filled
with
the
mingled
scent
of
beer
,
tobacco
smoke
,
and
Italian
cooking
.
Hanging
over
the
bar
was
an
oil_painting
of
a
nude
Al
had
accepted
from
a
student
at
the
Corcoran_Gallery
who
needed
to
eat
and
drink
and
was
broke
.
The
nude
was
small
and
black-haired
and
elfin
,
and
was
called
``
Eloise
''
.
This
was
one
place
where
Moonan
could
go
for
a
drink
in
a
back
booth
without
anyone
noticing
him
,
or
at_least
coming_up
and
hanging_around
and
wanting
to
know
all
the
low-down
.
The
other
patrons
were
taxi_drivers
and
art_students
and
small
shopkeepers
.
The
reporters
had
not_yet
discovered
that
this
was
his
hideaway
.
His
friend
Jane
was
with
him
.
She
was
wise
enough
to
realize
a
man
could
be
good
company
even
if
he
did
weigh
too_much
and
did
n't
own
the
mint
.
She
was
the
widow
of
a
writer
who
had
died
in
an
airplane
crash
,
and
Mickie
had
found
her
a
job
as
head
of
the
historical
section
of
the
Treasury
.
This
meant
sorting_out
press_clippings
and
the_like
.
Jane
sat
receptive
and
interested
.
Mickie
had
a
pleasant
glow
as
he
said
,
``
You
see
,
both
of
them
,
I
mean
the
President
and
Jeff_Lawrence
,
are
romantics
.
A
romantic
is
one
who
thinks
the
world
is
divinely
inspired
and
all
he
has_to
do
is
find
the
right
key
,
and
then
divine
justice
and
altruism
will
appear
.
It
's
like
focusing
a
camera
;
the
distant
ship
is
n't
there
until
you
get
the
focus
.
You
know
what
I'm
talking_about
.
I'm
sure
all
girls
feel
this
way
about
men
until
they
live
with
them
.
``
But
when
it
comes_to
war
,
the
Colonel
knows
what
it
is
and
Jeff
does
n't
.
Mr._Christiansen
knows
that
a
soldier
will
get
the
Distinguished_Service_Medal
for
conduct
that
would
land
him
in
prison
for
life
or
the
electric_chair
as
a
civilian
.
He
had
a
mean
,
unbroken
sheer
bastard
in
his
outfit
,
and
someone
invented
the
name
Trig
for
him
.
That
's
to
say
,
he
was
trigger_happy
.
He
'd
shoot
at
anything
if
it
was
the
rear_end
of
a
horse
or
his
own
sentry
.
He
was
a
wiry
,
inscrutable
,
silent
country
boy
from
the
red_clay
of
rural
Alabama
,
and
he
spoke
with
the
broad
drawl
that
others
normally
make_fun
of
.
But
not
in_front_of
Trig
.
I
heard
of
some
that
tried
it
back
in
the
States
,
and
he
'd
knock
them
clear
across
the
room
.
There
'd
been
a
pretty
bad
incident
back
at
the
Marine
base
.
A
New_York
kid
,
a
refugee
from
one
of
the
Harlem
gangs
,
made_fun
of
Trig
's
accent
,
and
drew
a
knife
.
Before
the
fight
was
over
,
the
Harlem
boy
had
a
concussion
and
Trig
was
cut_up
badly
.
They
caught
Trig
stealing
liquor
from
the
officers
'
mess
,
and
he
got
a_couple_of
girls
in_trouble
.
The
fear
of
punishment
just
did
n't
bother
him
.
It
was
n't
there
.
It
was
left_out
of
him
at_birth
.
This
is
why
he
made
such
a
magnificent
soldier
.
He
was
n't
troubled
with
the
ordinary
,
rank-and-file
fear
that
overcomes
and
paralyzes
and
sends
individual
soldiers
and
whole
companies
under_fire
running
in
panic
.
It
just
did
n't
occur
to
Trig
that
anything
serious
would
happen
to
him
.
Do
you
get_the_picture
of
the
kind
of
fellow
he
was
''
?
Jane
nodded
with
a
pleasant
smile
.
``
All_right
.
There
was
a
sniper
's
nest
in
a
mountain
cave
,
and
it
was
picking_off
our
men
with
devilish
accuracy
.
The
Colonel
ordered
that
it
be
wiped_out
,
and
I
suggested
,
'
You
ask
for
volunteers
,
and
promise
each
man
on
the
patrol
a
quart
of
whisky
,
ten
dollars
and
a
week-end
pass
to
Davao
'
.
Trig
was
one
of
the
five
volunteers
.
The
patrol
snaked
around
in
back
of
the
cave
,
approached
it
from
above
and
dropped
in
suddenly
with
wild
howls
.
You
could
hear
them
from
our
outpost
.
There
was
a_lot
of
shooting
.
We
knew
the
enemy
was
subdued
,
because
a
flare
was
fired
as
the
signal
.
So
we
hurried
over
.
Two
of
our
men
were
killed
,
a
third
was
wounded
.
Trig
and
a
very
black
colored
boy
from
Detroit
had
killed
or
put
out_of
action
ten
guerrillas
by
grenades
and
hand-to-hand
fighting
.
When
we
got
there
,
Trig
and
the
Negro
were
quarreling
over
possession
of
a
gold
crucifix
around
the
neck
of
a
wounded
Filipino
.
The
colored
boy
had
it
,
and
Trig
lunged
at
him
with
a
knife
and
said
,
'
Give
that
to
me
,
you
black
bastard
.
We
do
n't
'
low
nigras
to
walk
on
the
same
sidewalk
with
white_men
where
I
come
from
'
.
``
The
Negro
got
a
bad
slice
on
his
chest
from
the
knife
wound
''
.
``
What
did
the
Colonel
do
about
the
men
''
?
Jane
asked
in
her
placid
,
interested
way
.
Mickie
laughed
.
``
He
recommended
both
of
them
for
the
DSM
and
the
Detroit
fellow
for
the
Purple_Heart
,
too
,
for
a
combat
inflicted
wound
.
So
you
see
Mr._Christiansen
knows
what
it
's
all
about
.
But
not
Jeff_Lawrence
.
When
he
was
in
the
war
,
he
was
in
Law
or
Supplies
or
something
like
that
,
and
an
old
buddy
of
his
told
me
he
would
come
down
on
Sundays
to
the
Pentagon
and
read
the
citations
for
medals
-
just
like
the
one
we
sent_in
for
Trig
-
and
go_away
with
a
real
glow
.
These
were
heroes
nine
feet
tall
to
him
''
.
Jefferson_Lawrence
was
alone
at
the
small
,
perfectly
appointed
table
by
the
window
looking_out_over
the
river
.
He
had
dinner
and
sat
there
over
his
coffee
watching
the
winding
pattern
of
traffic
as
it
crossed
the
bridge
and
spread_out
like
a
serpent
with
two
heads
.
Open
beside
him
was
Mrs._Dalloway
.
He
thought
how
this
dainty
,
fragile
older
woman
threading
her
way
through
the
streets
of
Westminster
on
a
day
in
June
,
enjoying
the
flowers
in
the
shops
,
the
greetings
from
old
friends
,
but
never
really
drawing
a
deep
,
passionate
breath
,
was
so
like
himself
.
He
,
and
Mrs._Dalloway
,
too
,
had
never
permitted
themselves
the
luxury
of
joys
that
dug_into
the
bone_marrow
of
the
spirit
.
He
had
not
because
he
was
both
poor
and
ambitious
.
Poverty
imposes
a
kind
of
chastity
on
the
ambitious
.
They
cannot
stop
to
grasp
and
embrace
and
sit
in
the
back
seat
of
cars
along
a
dark
country
lane
.
No
,
they
must
look_the_other_way
and
climb
one
more
painful
step
up
the
ladder
.
He
made
the
decision
with
his
eyes
open
,
or
so
he
thought
.
At
any
cost
,
he
must
leave
the
dreary
Pennsylvania
mining
town
where
his
father
was
a
pharmacist
.
And
so
he
had
,
so
he
had
.
At
State_College
,
he
had
no
time
to
walk
among
the
violets
on
the
water
's
edge
.
From
his
room
he
could
look
out
in
springtime
and
see
the
couples
hand_in_hand
walking
slowly
,
deliciously
,
across
the
campus
,
and
he
could
smell
the
sweet
vernal
winds
.
He
was
not
stone
.
He
was
not
unmoved
.
He
had
to
teach
himself
patiently
that
these
traps
were
not
for
him
.
He
must
mentally
pull
the
blinds
and
close
the
window
,
so
that
all
that
existed
was
in
the
books
before
him
.
At
law_school
,
the
same
.
More
of
this
stamping_down
of
human
emotion
as
a
young
lawyer
in
New_York
.
By
the
time
he
was
prosperous
enough
-
his
goals
were
high
-
he
was
bald
and
afraid
of
women
.
The
only
one
who
would
have
him
was
his
cripple
,
the
strange
unhappy
woman
who
became
his
wife
.
Perhaps
it
was
right
;
perhaps
it
was
just
.
He
had
dared
to
defy
nature
,
to
turn
his
back
to
the
Lorelei
,
and
he
was
punished
.
Like
Mrs._Dalloway
,
with
her
regrets
about
Peter_Walsh
,
he
had
his
moments
of
melancholy
over
a
youth
too
well
spent
.
If
he
had
had
a
son
,
he
would
tell
him
,
``
Gather
ye
rosebuds
while
ye
may
.
This
same
flower
that
smiles
today
tomorrow
will
be
dying
''
.
But
then
his
son
could
afford
it
.
Lawrence
was
waiting
for
Bill_Boxell
.
The
Vice_President
had
called
and
asked
if
he
could
see
the
Secretary
at
his
home
.
He
said
the
matter
was
urgent
.
The
Secretary
was
uneasy
about
the
visit
.
He
did
not
like
Boxell
.
He
suspected
something
underhanded
and
furtive
about
him
.
Lawrence
could
not
put
his
finger
on_it
precisely
,
and
this
worried
him
.
When
you
disliked
or
distrusted
a
man
,
you
should
have
a
reason
.
Human
nature
was
not
a
piece
of
meat
you
could
tell
was
bad
by
its
smell
.
Lawrence
stared
a
minute
at
the
lighted
ribbon
of
traffic
,
hoping
that
a
clue
to
his
dislike
of
the
Vice_President
would
appear
.
It
did
not
.
Therefore
,
he
decided
he
was
unfair
to
the
young_man
and
should
make
an
effort
to
understand
and
sympathize
with
his
point_of_view
.
A
half_hour
later
the
Vice_President
arrived
.
He
looked
very
carefully
at
every
piece
of
furnishing
,
as
though
hoping
to
store
this
information
carefully
in
his
mind
.
He
observed
the
Florentine
vase
in
the
hall
,
the
Renoir
painting
in
the
library
,
as_well_as
the
long
shelves
of
well-bound
volumes
;
the
pattern
of
the
Oriental
rug
,
the
delicate
cut-glass
chandelier
.
He
said
to
the
Secretary
,
``
I
understand
you
came
from
a
little
Pennsylvania
town
near
Wilkes-Barre
.
How
did
you
find_out
about
this
''
?
He
waved
his
arm
around
at
the
furnishings
.
It
was
not
a
discourteous
question
,
Lawrence
decided
.
This
young_man
had
so
little
time
to
learn
he
had
to
be
curious
;
he
had
to
find_out
.
The
Secretary
did
not
tell
him
at
what
cost
,
at
what
loneliness
,
he
learned
these
things
.
He
merely
said
,
``
Any
good
decorator
these
days
can
make
you
a
tasteful
home
''
.
The
Vice_President
said
,
``
If
you
hear
of
any
names
that
would
fix_me_cheap
in_return_for
advertising
they
decorated
the
Vice_President
's
home
,
let
me
know
.
I
can
do
business
with
that
kind
''
.
Again
,
Lawrence
thought
a_little
sadly
,
these
were
the
fees
of
poverty
and
ambition
.
Boxell
did
not
have
the
chance
to
grow_up
graciously
.
He
had
to
acquire
everything
he
was
going_to
get
in
four
years
.
They
had
brandy
in
the
library
.
Boxell
looked
at
Lawrence
with
a
searching
glance
,
the
kind
that
a
prosecuting_attorney
would
give
a
man
on
trial
.
What
are
your
weaknesses
?
Where
will
you
break
?
How
best
to
destroy
your
peace
?
The
Vice_President
said
with
a
slight
bluster
,
``
There
is
n't
anyone
who
loves
the
President
more_than
I
do
.
Old_Chris
is
my
ideal
.
At_the_same_time
,
you
have_to
face
facts
and
realize
that
a
man
who
's
been
in
the
Marine_Corps
all
his
life
does
n't
understand
much
about
politics
.
What
does
a
monk
know
about
sex
''
?
Lawrence
listened
with
the
practiced
,
deceptive
calm
of
the
lawyer
,
but
his
face
was
in
the
shadow
.
``
So
,
we
have_to
protect
the
old_man
for
his
own
good
.
You
see
what
I
mean
.
Congress
is
full
of
politicians
,
and
if
you
want
to
get_along_with
them
,
you
have_to
be
politic
.
This
is
why
I
say
we
just
can't
go_ahead
and
disarm
the
Germans
and
pull_down
our
own
defenses
.
Let
me
tell
you
what
happened
to
me
today
.
A
fellow
came_up_to
me
,
a
Senator
,
I
do
n't
have_to
tell
you
his
name
,
and
he
told
me
,
'
I
love
the
President
like
a
brother
,
but
God_damn_it
,
he
's
crucifying
me
.
I
've
got
a
quarter
of
a_million
Germans
in
my
state
,
and
those
krautheads
tune_in
on
Father_Werther
every_night
,
and
if
he
tells
them
to
go_out
and
piss
in
the
public_square
,
that
's
what
they
do
.
He
's
telling
them
now
to
write
letters
to
their
Congressmen
opposing
the
disarmament
of
Germany
'
.
And
another
one
comes
to
me
and
he
says
,
'
Look_here
,
there
's
a
mill
in
my
state
employs
five
thousand
people
making
uniforms
for
the
Navy
.
