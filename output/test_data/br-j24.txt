Overwhelmed
with
the
care
of
five
young
children
and
concerned
about
persistent
economic
difficulties
due_to
her
husband
's
marginal
income
,
her
defense
of
denial
was
excessively
strong
.
Thus
the
lack
of
effective
recognition
of
the
responsibilities
involved
in
caring
for
two
babies
showed
signs
of
becoming
a
disabling
problem
.
The
result
,
dramatically
visible
in
a
matter
of
days
in
the
family
's
disrupted
daily
functioning
,
was
a
phobic-like
fear
that
some
terrible
harm
would
befall
the
second
twin
,
whose
birth
had
not
been
anticipated
.
Soon
Mrs._B
.
's
fears
threatened
to
burst
into
a
full-blown
panic
concerning
the
welfare
of
the
entire
family
.
Inability
to
care
for
the
other
children
,
difficulty
in
feeding
the
babies
,
who
seemed
colicky
,
bone-weary
fatigue
,
repeated
crying
episodes
,
and
short_tempers
reflected
the
family
's
helplessness
in
coping_with
the
stressful
situation
.
Clearly
,
this
was
a
family
in
crisis
.
Mrs._B.
compared
her
feelings
of
weakness
to
her
feelings
of
weakness
and
helplessness
at_the_time
of
her
mother
's
death
when
she
was
eight
,
as_well
as
her
subsequent
anger
at
her
father
for
remarrying
.
Her
previous
traumatic
experiences
flashed
through
her
mind
as
if
they
had
happened
yesterday
.
On
the
anniversary
of
her
father
's
death
she
poured_out
with
agonized
tears
her
feelings
of
guilt
about
not
having
attended
his
funeral
.
In
the
family
's
own
words
(
during
the
third
of
twelve
visits
)
,
they
had
``
reached
the
crisis
peak
-
either
the
situation
will
give
or
we
will
break
''
!
Direct
confrontation
and
acceptance
of
Mrs._B
.
's
anger
against
the
second
baby
soon
dissipated
her
fears
of
annihilation
.
Abreaction
of
her
anxiety
and
guilt
concerning
the
death
of
her
parents
,
when
linked
up
with
her
current
feelings
of
anger
and
her
fears
of
loss
,
abandonment
,
and
annihilation
,
produced
further
relief
of
tension
.
In
a
joint
interview
Mr.
and
Mrs._B.
were
helped
to
understand
the
meaning
of
a
younger
son
's
wandering
away_from_home
in_terms_of
his
feelings
of
displacement
in
reaction
to
the
arrival
of
the
twins
.
The
father
,
accurately
perceiving
the
child
's
needs
,
not_only
respected
them
as
worthy
of
his
attention
,
but
immediately
satisfied
them
by
taking
him
on
his
lap
along
with
the
twins
,
saying
,
``
I
have
a
big
lap
;
there
is
room
for
you
,
too
,
Johnnie
''
.
Simultaneously
,
a
variety
of
environmental
supports
-
a
calm
but
not
too
motherly
homemaker
,
referral
for
temporary
economic
aid
,
intelligent
use
of
nursing_care
,
accompaniment
to
the
well-baby
clinic
for
medical
advice
on
the
twins
'
feeding
problem
-
combined
to
prevent
further
development
of
predictable
pathological
mechanisms
.
Follow-up
visits
of
the
nurse
and
social_worker
indicated
continued
success
in
the
care
of
the
new
babies
as_well
as
a
marked
improvement
in
the
family
's
day-to-day
mental_health
and
social
functioning
.
As
seen
in
the
B.
family
,
there
must
be
an
attempt
to
help
the
client
develop
conscious
awareness
of
the
problem
,
especially
in
the
absence
of
a
formal
request
for
assistance
.
The
lack
of
awareness
usually
springs
from
deep
but
disguised
anxiety
,
often
assuming
the
superficial
guise
of
``
not
knowing
''
or
``
not
caring
''
.
The
unhealthy
use
of
denial
in
the
initial
reaction
to
a
stress
must
be
handled
through
the
medium
of
a
positive
controlled
transference
.
In_general
,
the
approach
is
more
active
than
passive
,
more
out-reaching
than
reflective
.
While
some
regression
is
inevitable
,
it
is
discouraged
rather_than
encouraged
so_that
the
transference
does
not
follow
the
stages
of
planned
regression
associated
with
certain
casework
adaptations
of
the
psychoanalytic
model
for
insight
therapy
.
To
establish
an
emotionally
meaningful
relationship
the
worker
must
demonstrate
actual
or
potential
helpfulness
immediately
,
preferably
within
the
first
interview
,
by
meeting
the
client
's
specific
needs
.
These
needs
usually
concern
the
reduction
of
guilt
and
some
relief
of
tension
.
The
initial
interview
must
be
therapeutic
rather_than
purely
exploratory
in
an
information-seekingsense
.
In_this
relationship-building
stage
the
worker
must
communicate
confidence
in
the
client
's
ability
to
deal
with
the
problem
.
In
so
doing
he
implicitly
offers
the
positive
contagion
of
hope
as
a
kind_of
maturational
dynamic
to
counteract
feelings
of
helplessness
and
hopelessness
generally
associated
with
the
first
stages
of
stress
impact
.
Thus
,
the
client
receives
enough
ego
support
to
engage
in
constructive
efforts
on_his_own
behalf
.
Here
there
is
a
specific
preventive
component
which
applies
in
a
more
generalized
sense
to
any
casework
situation
.
We
are
preventing
or
averting
pathogenic
phenomena
such_as
undue
regression
,
unhealthy
suppression
and
repression
,
excessive
use
of
denial
,
and
crippling
guilt
turned
against
the
self
.
While
some
suppression
and
some
denial
are
not_only
necessary
but
healthy
,
the
worker
's
clinical
knowledge
must
determine
how
these
defenses
are
being
used
,
what
healthy
shifts
in
defensive
adaptation
are
indicated
,
and
when
efforts
at
bringing_about
change
can
be
most
effectively
timed
.
In
steering
the
family
toward
ego-adaptive
and
away
from
maladaptive
responses
,
the
worker
uses
time-honored
focused
casework
techniques
of
specific
emotional
support
,
clarification
,
and
anticipatory
guidance
.
Over
a
relatively
short
period_of_time
,
usually
about
four
to
twelve
weeks
,
the
worker
must
be
able
to
shift
the
focus
,
back_and_forth
,
between
immediate
external
stressful
exigencies
(
``
precipitating
stress
''
)
and
the
key
,
emotionally
relevant
issues
(
``
underlying
problem
''
)
which
are
,
often
in
a
dramatic
preconscious
breakthrough
,
reactivated
by
the
crisis
situation
,
and
hence
once_again
amenable
to
resolution
.
Though
there
is
obviously
nothing
new
about
these
techniques
,
they
do
challenge
the
worker
's
skill
to
articulate
them
precisely
on_the_spot
and
on
the
basis
of
quick
and
accurate
diagnostic
assessments
.
Then
,
too
,
the
utmost
clinical
flexibility
is
necessary
in
judiciously
combining
carefully
timed
family-oriented
home
visits
,
single
and
group
office
interviews
,
and
appropriate
telephone
follow-up
calls
,
if
the
worker
is
to
be
genuinely
accessible
and
if
the
predicted
unhealthy
outcome
is
to
be
actually
averted
in_accordance_with
the
principles
of
preventive
intervention
.
In_addition
,
in
many
cases
,
a
variety
of
concrete
social
resources
-
homemaker
,
day_care
,
medical
and
financial_aid
-
must
be
reasonably
available
for
the
reality
support
needed
to
bolster
the
family
in
its
individual
and
collective
coping
and
integrative
efforts
.
At
certain
critical
stages
,
and
only
for
sound
diagnostic
reasons
,
it
may
be
important
to
accompany
family
members
in
their
use
of
these
resources
if
their
problem-solving
behavior
is
to
be
constructive
rather_than
defeating
.
While
expensive
in_time
and
involving
a
great_deal
of
adaptation
on
the
part
of
the
worker
(
in_terms_of
his
willingness
to
leave
the
sanctity
of
his
office
and
enter
actively
into
the
client
's
life
)
,
techniques
of
accompaniment
were
found
to
be
of
tremendous
value
when
in
the
service
of
specific
preventive
objectives
.
Finally
,
whatever
the
techniques
used
,
a
twin
goal
is
common
to
all
preventive
casework
service
:
to
cushion
or
reduce
the
force
of
the
stress
impact
while
at_the_same_time
to
encourage
and
support
family
members
to
mobilize
and
use
their
ego
capacities
.
Having
outlined
an
approach
to
the
theory
and
practice
of
preventive
casework
,
we
now
address
ourselves
to
our
final
question
:
What
place
should
brief
,
crisis-oriented
preventive
casework
occupy
in
our
total
spectrum
of
services
?
We
should
first
recognize
our
tendency
to
develop
a
hierarchy
of
values
,
locating
brief
treatment
at
the
bottom
and
long-term
intensive
service
at
the
top
,
instead
of
seeing
the
services
as
part
of
a
continuum
,
each
important
in
its
own
right
.
This
problem
is
perhaps
as
old
as
social
casework
itself
.
Almost
three
decades
ago
Bertha_Reynolds
undertook
a
study
of
short-contact
interviewing
because
of
her
conviction
that
short-term
casework
had
an
important
but
neglected
place
in
our
network
of
social_services
.
Her
conclusion
has
been
borne_out
in
the
experience
of
many
practitioners
:
``
short-contact
interviewing
is
neither
a
truncated
nor
a
telescoped
experience
but
is
of
the
same
essential
quality
as
the
so-called
intensive
case
work
''
.
Thus
,
casework
involving
a
limited
number
of
interviews
is
still
to
be
regarded
in_terms_of
the
quality
of
service
rendered
rather_than
of
the
quantity
of
time
expended
.
That
we
are
experiencing
an
upsurge
of
interest
in
the
many
formulations
and
preventive
adaptations
of
brief
treatment
in
social
casework
is
evident
from
even
a
small
sampling
of
current
literature
.
Especially
noteworthy
is
Levinger
's
finding
that
the
length
of
treatment
per_se
is
not
a
reliable
indicator
of
successful
outcome
.
According
to
a_number_of
studies
,
the
important
predictors
are
the
nature
and
management
of
the
client
's
anxiety
as_well
as
the
accessibility
of
the
helping
person
.
For_example
,
the
level
of
improvement
noted
in
a
recent
experiment
with
a
short
course
of
immediate
treatment
for
parent-child
relationship
problems
compared
favorably
with
the
results
reported
by
typical
child
guidance
clinics
where
the
hours
spent
in
purely
diagnostic
study
may
equal
or
exceed
the
number
of
hours
devoted
to
actual
treatment
interviews
in
the
experimental
project
.
Of
startling
significance
,
too
,
is
the
assertion
that
it
was
possible
to
carry_out
this
program
with
only
a
6
percent
attrition_rate
as
compared
with
a
rate
of
59
percent
reported
for
a
comparable
group
of
families
who
were
receiving
help
in
traditionally
operated
child
guidance
services
.
These
reports
refer
to
a_level
of
secondary
prevention
in
a
child
guidance
clinic
approached
by
the
customary
route
of
voluntary
referral
by
the
family
or
by
other
professional
people
.
Similarities
to
the
approach
which
I
have
described
are
evident
in
the
prompt
establishment
of
a
helping
relationship
,
quick
appraisal
of
key
issues
,
and
the
immediate
mobilization
of
treatment
plans
as
the
essential
dynamics
in
helping
to
further
the
ego
's
coping
efforts
in
dealing
with
the
interplay
of
inner
and
outer
stresses
.
While
there
are
many
different
possibilities
for
the
timing
of
casework
intervention
,
the
experiments
recently
reported
from
a
variety
of
traditional
settings
all
point_up
the
importance
of
an
immediate
response
to
the
client
's
initial
need
for
help
.
In
some
programs
,
treatment
is
concentrated
over
a
short
period_of_time
,
while
in
others
,
after
the
initial
contact
is
established
,
flexible
spacing
of
interviews
has
been
experimentally
used
with
apparent
success
.
Willingness
to
take
the
risk
of
early
and
direct
interpretation
(
with
the
proviso
that
if
the
interpretation
is
too
threatening
,
the
worker
can
withdraw
)
is
another
prominent
feature
in
these
efforts
.
My
aim
in
mentioning
this
factor
obviously
is
not
to
give
license
to
``
wild
therapy
''
but
rather
to
encourage
us
to
use
the
time-honored
clinical
casework
skills
we
already
possess
,
and
to
use
them
with
greater
confidence
,
precision
,
and
professional
pride
.
Though
there
is
obviously
great
need
for
continued
experimentation
with
various
types
of
short-term
intervention
to
further
efforts
in
developing
an
operational
definition
of
prevention
at
the
secondary
-
or
perhaps
,
in
some
instances
,
primary
-
level
,
the
place
of
short-term
intervention
has
already
been
documented
by
a_number_of
investigators
in
a
wide
variety
of
settings
.
Woodward
,
for_example
,
has
emphasized
the
``
need
for
a
broad
spectrum
of
services
,
including
very
brief
services
in
connection
with
critical
situations
''
.
Ideally
,
brief
treatment
should
be
arrived_at
as
a
treatment
of
choice
rather_than
as
a
treatment
of
chance
.
Moreover
,
the
shortage
of
treatment
resources
and
the
chronically
persistent
shortage
of
mental_health
manpower
force
us
to
innovate
additional
refinements
of
preventive
intervention
techniques
to
make
services
more
widely
available
-
and
on
a
more
effective
basis
to
more
people
.
Further
research
in
the
meaning
of
crises
as
experienced
by
the
consumers
of
traditional
social
casework
services
-
including
attempts
to
develop
a
typology
of
family
structures
,
crisis
problems
,
reaction
mechanisms
,
and
differential
treatment
approaches
-
and
the
establishment
of
new
experimental
programs
are
imperative
social
needs
which
should
command
the
best
efforts
of
caseworkers
in_collaboration
with
community
planners
.
our
literature
is
already
replete
with
a
fantastic
number
of
suggestions
for
preventive
agency
programming
ranging
from
the
immediately
practical
to
the
globally
utopian
.
Probably
,
in
the
immediate
future
,
we
will
have
to
settle
for
middle-range
efforts
that
fall_short_of
utopian
models
.
Increased
experimentation
with
multipurpose
agencies
,
especially
those
that
combine
afresh
the
traditional
functions
of
family
and
child_welfare_services
,
holds
rich
promise
for
the
future
.
For_example
,
child
welfare
experience
abounds
with
cases
in_which
the
parental
request
for
substitute
care
is
precipitated
by
a
crisis
event
which
is
meaningfully
linked
with
a
fundamental
unresolved
problem
of
family_relationships
.
