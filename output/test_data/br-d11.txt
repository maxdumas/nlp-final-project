When
they
say
that
under
no
circumstances
would
it
ever
be
right
to
``
permit
''
the
termination
of
the
human_race
by
human_action
,
because
there
could
not
possibly
be
any
proportionate
grave
reason
to
justify
such
a
thing
,
they
know
exactly
what
they
mean
.
Of_course
,
in
prudential
calculation
,
in
balancing
the
good
directly
intended
and
done
against
the
evil
unintended
and
indirectly
done
,
no
greater
precision
can
be
forthcoming
than
the
subject
allows
.
Yet
it
seems
clear
that
there
can
be
no
good
sufficiently
great
,
or
evil
repelled
sufficiently
grave
,
to
warrant
the
destruction
of
mankind
by
man
's
own
action
.
I
mean
,
however
,
that
the
moral
theologian
knows
what
he
means
by
``
permit
''
.
He
is
not
talking
in_the_main
about
probabilities
,
risks
and
danger
in_general
.
He
is
talking_about
an
action
which
just_as
efficaciously
does
an
evil
thing
(
and
is
known
certainly
and
unavoidably
to
lead
to
this
evil
result
)
as
it
efficaciously
does
some
good
.
He
is
talking_about
double
effects
,
of_which
the
specific
action
causes
directly
the
one
and
indirectly
the
other
,
but
causes
both
;
of_which
one
is
deliberately
willed
or
intended
and
the
other
not
intended
or
not
directly
intended
,
but
still
both
are
done
,
while
the
evil
effect
is
,
with
equal
consciousness
on
the
part
of
the
agent
,
foreknown
to
be
among
the
consequences
.
This
is
what
,
in
a
technical
sense
,
to
``
only
permit
''
an
evil
result
means
.
It
means
to
do
it
and
to
know
one
is
doing
it
,
but
as
only
a
secondary
if
certain
effect
of
the
good
one
primarily
does
and
intends
.
Of_course
,
grave
guiltiness
may
be
imputed
to
the
military_action
of
any
nation
,
or
to
the
action
of
any
leader
or
leaders
,
which
for
any
supposed
good
``
permits
''
,
in_this
sense
,
the
termination
of
the
human_race
by
human_action
.
Certainly
,
in
analyzing
an
action
which
truly
faced
such
alternatives
,
``
it
is
never
possible
that
no
world
would
be
preferable
to
some
worlds
,
and
there
are
in_truth
no
circumstances
in_which
the
destruction
of
human
life
presents
itself
as
a
reasonable
alternative
''
.
Naturally
,
where
one
or
the
other
of
the
effects
of
an
action
is
uncertain
,
this
has
to
be
taken_into_account
.
Especially
is
this
true
when
,
because
the
good
effect
is
remote
and
speculative
while
the
evil
is
certain
and
grave
,
the
action
is
prohibited
.
Presumably
,
if
the
reverse
is
the
case
and
the
good
effect
is
more
certain
than
the
evil
result
that
may
be
forthcoming
,
not_only
must
the
good
and
the
evil
be
prudentially
weighed
and
found
proportionate
,
but
also
calculation
of
the
probabilities
and
of
the
degree
of
certainty
or
uncertainty
in
the
good
or
evil
effect
must
be
taken_into_account
.
There
must_not
only
be
greater
good
than
evil
objectively
in_view
,
but
also
greater
probability
of
actually
doing
more
good
than
harm
.
If
an
evil
which
is
certain
and
extensive
and
immediate
may
rarely
be
compensated
for
by
a
problematic
,
speculative
,
future
good
,
by
the
same
token
not
every
present
,
certain
,
and
immediate
good
(
or
lesser
evil
)
that
may
have
to
be
done
will
be
outweighed
by
a
problematic
,
speculative
,
and
future
evil
.
Nevertheless
,
according
to
the
traditional
theory
,
a
man
begins
in_the_midst
of
action
and
he
analyzes
its
nature
and
immediate
cosequences
before
or
while
putting
it
forth
and
causing
these
consequences
.
He
does
not
expect
to
be
able
to
trammel_up
all
the
future
consequences
of
his
action
.
Above_all
,
he
does
not
debate
mere
contingencies
,
and
therefore
,
if
these
are
possibly
dreadful
,
find
himself
forced
into
inaction
.
He
does
what
he
can
and
may
and
must
,
without
regarding
himself
as
lord
of
the
future
or
,
on_the_other_hand
,
as
covered
with
guilt
by_accident
or
unforeseen
consequences
or
by
results
he
did
not
``
permit
''
in
the
sense
explained
.
By
contrast
,
a
good_deal
of
nuclear
pacifism
begins
with
the
contingencies
and
the
probabilities
,
and
not
with
the
moral
nature
of
the
action
to
be
done
;
and
by
deriving
legitimate
decision
backward
from
whatever
may
conceivably
or
possibly
or
probably
result
,
whether
by
anyone
's
doing
or
by_accident
,
it
finds
itself
driven
to
inaction
,
to
non-political
action
in
politics
and
non-military
action
in
military
affairs
,
and
to
the
not
very
surprising
discovery
that
there
are
now
no
distinctions
on_which
the
defense
of
justice
can
possibly
be
based
.
Mr._Philip_Toynbee
writes
,
for_example
,
that
``
in_terms_of
probability
it
is
surely
as
likely
as
not
that
mutual
fear
will
lead
to
accidental
war
in
the
near
future
if
the
present
situation
continues
.
If
it
continues
indefinitely
it
is
nearly
a
statistical
certainty
that
a
mistake
will
be
made
and
that
the
devastation
will
begin
''
.
Against
such
a
termination
of
human
life
on
earth
by
human_action
,
he
then
proposes
as_an_alternative
that
we
``
negotiate
at_once
with
the
Russians
and
get
the
best
terms
which
are
available
''
,
that
we
deliberately
``
negotiate
from
comparative
weakness
''
.
He
bravely
attempts
to
face
this
alternative
realistically
,
i.
e.
,
by
considering
the
worst
possible
outcome
,
namely
,
the
total
domination
of
the
world
by
Russia
within
a_few
years
.
This
would
be
by_far
the
better
choice
,
when
``
it
is
a
question
of
allowing
the
human_race
to
survive
,
possibly
under
the
domination
of
a
regime
which
most_of
us
detest
,
or
of
allowing
it
to
destroy
itself
in
appalling
and
prolonged
anguish
''
.
Nevertheless
,
the
consequence
of
the
policy
proposed
is
everywhere
subtly
qualified
:
it
is
``
a
possible
result
,
however
improbable
''
;
``
the
worst
,
and
least
probable
''
result
;
``
if
it
did
n't
prevail
mankind
would
still
be
given
the
opportunity
of
prevailing
''
;
for
``
surely
anything
is
better
than
a
policy
which
allows_for
the
possibility
of
nuclear
war
''
.
If
we
have
not
thought
and
made
a
decision
entirely
in
these
terms
,
then
we
need
to
submit
ourselves
to
the
following
``
simple
test
''
:
``
Have
we
decided
how
we
are
to
kill
the
other
members
of
our
household
in
the
event
of
our
being
less
injured
than
they
are
''
?
Thus
,
moral
decision
must
be
entirely
deduced
backward
from
the
likely
eventuality
;
it
is
no_longer
to
be
formulated
in_terms_of
the
nature
of
present
action
itself
,
its
intention
,
and
proximate
effect
or
the
thing
to
be
done
.
Several
of
the
replies
to
Mr._Toynbee
,
without
conscious
resort
to
the
traditional
terminology
with
regard_to
the
permission
of
evil
,
succeed
in
restoring
the
actual
context
in_which
present
moral
and
political
decisions
must
be
made
,
by
distinguishing
between
choosing
a
great
evil
and
choosing
in
danger
of_this
evil
.
``
It
is
worse
for
a
nation
to
give_in
to
evil
than
to
run
the
risk
of
annihilation
''
.
``
I
am
consciously
prepared
to
run
the
continued
risk
of
'
race
suicide
by_accident
'
rather_than
accept
the
alternative
certainty
of
race
slavery
by_design
.
But
I
can
only
make
this
choice
because
I
believe
that
the
risk
need
not
increase
,
but
may
be
deliberately
reduced
''
[
by
precautions
against
accidents
or
by
limiting
war
?
]
``
Quoting
Mr._Kennan
's
phrase
that
anything
would
be
better
than
a
policy
which
led
inevitably
to
nuclear
war
,
he
[
Toynbee
]
says
that
anything
is
better
than
a
policy
which
allows_for
the
possibility
of
nuclear
war
''
.
``
If
asked
to
choose
between
a
terrible
probability
and
a
more
terrible
possibility
,
most
men
will
choose
the
latter
''
.
``
If
Philip_Toynbee
is
claiming
that
the
choice
lies
between
capitulation
and
the
risk
of
nuclear
war
,
I
think
he
is
right
.
I
do
not
accept
that
the
choice
is
between
capitulation
and
the
certainty
of
nuclear
war
''
.
Even
Professor_Arnold_Toynbee
,
agreeing
with
his
son
,
does
so
in
these
terms
:
``
Compared
to
continuing
to
incur
a
constant
risk
of
the
destruction
of
the
human_race
,
all
other
evils
are
lesser
evils
.
Let
us
therefore
put
first
things
first
,
and
make_sure
of
preserving
the
human_race
at
whatever
the
temporary
price
may
be
''
.
Mr._Philip_Toynbee
affirms
at
one
point
that
if
he
shared
the
anticipations
of
Orwell
in
Nineteen
Eighty-Four
,
if
he
believed
Communism
was
not_only
evil
but
``
also
irredeemably
evil
''
,
then
he
might
``
think
it
right
to
do
anything
rather_than
to
take
the
risk
of
a
communist
world
.
Even
a
nuclear
holocaust
is
a_little
less
frightful
to
contemplate
than
a
race
of
dehumanised
humans
occupying
the
earth
until
doomsday
''
.
No
political
order
or
economic_system
is
so
clearly
contrary
to
nature
.
But
one
does
not
have
to
affirm
the
existence
of
an
evil
order
irredeemable
in_that
sense
,
or
a
static
order
in_which
no
changes
will
take_place
in_time
,
to
be
able
truthfully
to
affirm
the
following
fact
:
there
has
never
been
justitia
imprinted
in
social
institutions
and
social
relationships
except
in
the
context
of
some
pax-ordo
preserved
by
clothed
or
naked
force
.
On
their
way
to
the
Heavenly_City
the
children
of
God
make
use
of
the
pax-ordo
of
the
earthly
city
and
acknowledge
their
share
in
responsibility
for
its
preservation
.
Not
to
repel
injury
and
uphold
and
improve
pax-ordo
means
not
simply
to
accept
the
misshapen
order
and
injustice
that
challenges
it
at
the
moment
,
but
also
to
start
down
the
steep
slope
along
which
justice
can
find
no
place
whereon
to
stand
.
Toynbee
seems
to
think
that
there
is
some
other
way
to
give
justice
social
embodiment
.
``
I
would
far
rather
die
after
a
Russian
occupation
of_this
country
-
by
some
deliberate
act
of
refusal
-
than
die
uselessly
by
atomisation
''
.
Would
such
an
act
of
refusal
be
useful
?
He
does
not
mean
,
in_fact
he
addresses
himself
specifically
to
reject
the
proposition
,
that
``
if
we
took
the
risk
of
surrendering
,
a
new
generation
in
Britain
would
soon
begin
to
amass
its
strength
in_secret
in_order_to
reverse
the
consequences
of_that
surrender
''
.
He
wants
to
be
``
brutally
frank
and
say
that
these
rebellions
would
be
hopeless
-
far
,
far
more
hopeless
than
was
the
Hungarian
revolution
of
1956
''
.
This
is
not
a
project
for
regaining
the
ground
for
limited_war
,
by
creating
a
monopoly
in
one
power
of
the
world
's
arsenal
of
unlimited
weapons
.
It
is
a
proposal
that
justice
now
be
served
by
means
other_than
those
that
have
ever
preconditioned
the
search
for
it
,
or
preconditioned
more
positive
means
for
attaining
it
,
in_the_past
.
``
It
is
no
good
recommending
surrender
rather_than
nuclear
warfare
with
the
proviso
that
surrender
could
be
followed
by
the
effective
military
resistance
by
occupied
peoples
.
Hope
for
the
future
would
lie_in
the
natural
longing
of
the
human_race
for
freedom
and
the
right
to
develop
''
.
This
is
to
surrender
in_advance
to
whatever
attack
may
yet
be
mounted
,
to
the
very
last
;
it
is
to
stride
along
the
steep
slope
downward
.
The
only
contrary
action
,
in_the_future
as
in_the_past
,
runs
the
risk
of
war
;
and
,
now
and
in_the_future
unlike
in_the_past
,
any
attempt
to
repel
injury
and
to
preserve
any
particular
civilized
attainment
of
mankind
or
its
provisional
justice
runs
some
risk
of
nuclear
warfare
and
the
danger
that
an
effect
of_it
will
,
by
human_action
,
render
this
planet
less
habitable
by
the
human_race
.
That
is
why
it
is
so_very
important
that
ethical
analysis
keep
clear
the
problem
of
decision
as
to
``
permitted
''
effects
,
and
not
draw_back
in
fright
from
any
conceivable
contingency
or
suffer
paralysis
of
action
before
possibilities
or
probabilities
unrelated
,
or
not
directly
morally
related
,
to
what
we
can
and
may
and
must
do
as
long
as
human
history
endures
.
Finally
,
just_as
no
different
issues
are
posed
for
thoughtful
analysis
by
the
foreshortening
of
time
that
may
yet
pass
before
the
end
of
human
life
on
this
earth
,
but
only
stimulation
and
alarm
to
the
imagination
,
the
same
thing
must
be
said
in
connection
with
the
question
of_what
we
may
perhaps
already
be
doing
,
by
human_action
,
to
accelerate
this
end
.
We
should
not
allow
the
image
of
an
immanent
end
brought_about
indirectly
by
our
own
action
in
the
continuing
human
struggle
for
a
just
endurable
order
of
existence
to
blind
us
to
the
fact
that
in
some
measure
accelerating
the
end
of
our
lease
may
be
one
consequence
among
others
of
many
other
of
mankind
's
thrusts
toward
we
know
not
what
future
.
