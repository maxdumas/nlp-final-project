One_hundred
years
ago
there
existed
in
England
the
Association_for_the_Promotion_of_the_Unity_of_Christendom
.
Representing
as_it_did
the
efforts
of
only
unauthorized
individuals
of
the
Roman
and
Anglican_Churches
,
and
urging
a
communion
of
prayer
unacceptable
to
Rome
,
this
association
produced
little
fruit
,
and
,
in_fact
,
was
condemned
by
the
Holy_Office
in
1864
.
Now
again
in
1961
,
in
England
,
there
is
perhaps
nothing
in
the
religious
sphere
so
popularly
discussed
as
Christian
unity
.
The
Church_Unity_Octave
,
January
18
-
25
,
was
enthusiastically
devoted
to
prayer
and
discussion
by
the
various
churches
.
Many
people
seem
hopeful
,
yet
it
is
difficult
to
predict
whether
or
not
there
will
be
any
more
real
attainment
of
Christian
unity
in
1961
than
there
was
in
1861
.
But
it
must
be
readily
seen
that
the
religious
picture
in
England
has
so
greatly
changed
during
these
hundred
years
as
to
engender
hope
,
at_least
on
the
Catholic
side
.
For
``
the_tide_is_well_on_the_turn
''
,
as
the
London_Catholic_weekly_Universe
has
written
.
I
came
to
England
last
summer
to
do
research
on
the
unpublished
letters
of
Cardinal_Newman
.
As
an
American
Catholic
of
Irish
ancestry
,
I
came
with
certain
preconceptions
and
expectations
;
being
intellectually
influenced
by
Newman
and
the
general
19th
century
literature
of
England
,
I
knew
only
a
Protestant
dominated
country
.
Since
arriving
here
,
however
,
I
have
formed
a
far
different
religious
picture
of
present-day
England
.
In
representing
part
of
this
new
picture
,
I
will
be
recounting
some
of
my
own
personal
experiences
,
reactions
and
judgments
;
but
my
primary
aim
is
to
transcribe
what
Englishmen
themselves
are
saying
and
writing
and
implying
about
the
Roman
and
Anglican_Churches
and
about
the
present
religious
state
of
England
.
Since
the
Protestant
clergy
for_the_most_part
wear
gray
or
some
variant
from
the
wholly
black
suit
,
my
Roman_collar
and
black
garb
usually
identify
me
in
England
as
a
Roman_Catholic
cleric
.
In_any_case
,
I
have
always
been
treated
with
the
utmost
courtesy
by
Englishmen
,
even
in
Devonshire
and
Cornwall
,
where
anti
Catholic
feeling
has
supposedly
existed
the
strongest
and
longest
.
Nowhere
have
I
seen
public
expression
of
anti-Catholicism
.
On
my
first
Guy_Fawkes_Day
here
,
I
found
Catholics
as
well
as
non
Catholics
celebrating
with
the
traditional
fireworks
and
bonfires
,
and
was
told
that
most
Englishmen
either
do
not
know
or
are
not
concerned
with
the
historical
significance
of
the
day
.
A
Birmingham
newspaper
printed
in
a
column
for
children
an
article
entitled
``
The
True
Story
of
Guy_Fawkes
''
,
which
began
:
``
When
you
pile
your
''
guy
``
on
the
bonfire
tomorrow
night
,
I
wonder
how
much
of
the
true
story
of
Guy_Fawkes
you
will
remember
?
In
the
355
years
since
the
first
Guy_Fawkes_Night
,
much
of
the
story
has
been
forgotten
,
so
here
is
a
reminder
''
.
The
article
proceeded
to
give
an
inaccurate
account
of
a
catholic
plot
to
kill
King_James_/1_1
,
.
In_spite_of
the
increase
in
numbers
and
prestige
brought_about
by
the
conversions
of
Newman
and
other
Tractarians
of
the
1840
's
and
1850
's
,
the
Catholic
segment
of
England
one_hundred
years
ago
was
a
very
small
one
(
four
per_cent
,
or
800000
)
which
did
not
enjoy
a
gracious
hearing
from
the
general
public
.
The
return
of
the
Catholic
hierarchy
in
1850
was
looked_upon
with
indignant
disapprobation
and
,
in_fact
,
was
charged
with
being
a
gesture
of
disloyalty
.
In
1864
Newman
professedly
had
to
write
his
Apologia
with
his
keenest
feelings
in_order_to
be
believed
and
to
command
a
fair
hearing
from
English
readers
.
Now
,
in
1961
,
the
Catholic
population
of
England
is
still
quite
small
(
ten
per_cent
,
or
5
million
)
;
yet
it
represents
a
very
considerable
percentage
of
the
churchgoing
population
.
A
Protestant
woman
marveled
to
me
over
the
large
crowds
going_in
and
out
of
the
Birmingham_Oratory
(
Catholic
)
Church
on
Sunday
mornings
.
She
found
this
a
marvel
because
,
as
she
said
,
only
six
per_cent
of
English_people
are
churchgoers
.
She
may
not
have
been
exact
on
this
number
,
but
others
here
feel
quite
certain
that
the
percentage
would
be
less_than
ten
.
From
many
sides
come
remarks
that
Protestant
churches
are
badly
attended
and
the
large
medieval
cathedrals
look
all_but
empty
during
services
.
A
Catholic
priest
recently
recounted
how
in
the
chapel
of
a
large
city_university
,
following
Anglican
evensong
,
at
which
there
was
a
congregation
of
twelve
,
he
celebrated
Mass
before
more_than
a_hundred
.
The
Protestants
themselves
are
the
first
to
admit
the
great
falling_off
in
effective
membership
in
their
churches
.
According_to
a
newspaper
report
of
the
1961
statistics
of
the
Church_of_England
,
the
``
total
of
confirmed
members
is
9748000
,
but
only
2887671
are
registered
on
the
parochial
church_rolls
''
,
and
``
over
27
million
people
in
England
are
baptized
into
the
Church_of_England
,
but
roughly
only
a
tenth
of
them
continue
''
.
An
amazing
article
in
the
Manchester_Guardian
of
last
November
,
entitled
``
Fate
of
Redundant
Churches
''
,
states
than
an
Archbishops
'
Commission
``
reported
last
month
that
in
the
Church_of_England
alone
there
are
790
churches
which
are
redundant
now
,
or
will
be
in
20
years
'
time
.
A
further
260
Anglican
churches
have
been
demolished
since
1948
''
.
And
in
the
last
five
years
,
the
``
Methodist
chapel
committee
has
authorized
the
demolition
or
,
more
often
,
the
sale
of
764
chapels
''
.
Most
of
these
former
churches
are
now
used
as
warehouses
,
but
``
neither
Anglicans
nor
Nonconformists
object
to
selling
churches
to
Roman_Catholics
''
,
and
have
done
so
.
While
it
must
be
said
that
these
same
Protestants
have
built
some
new
churches
during
this
period
,
and
that
religious
population_shifts
have
emptied
churches
,
a
principal
reason
for
this
phenomenon
of
redundancy
is
that
fewer
Protestants
are
going_to
church
.
It
should
be
admitted
,
too
,
that
there
is
a
good
percentage
of
lapsed
or
nonchurchgoing
Catholics
(
one
paper
writes
50
per_cent
)
.
Still
,
it
is
clear
from
such
reports
,
and
apparently
clear
from
the
remarks
of
many
people
,
that
Protestants
are
decreasing
and
Catholics
increasing
.
An
Anglican
clergyman
in
Oxford
sadly
but
frankly
acknowledged
to
me
that
this
is
true
.
A
century
ago
,
Newman
saw
that
liberalism
(
what
we
now
might
call
secularism
)
would
gradually
but
definitely
make
its
mark
on
English_Protestantism
,
and
that
even
high_Anglicanism
would
someday
no_longer
be
a
``
serviceable
breakwater
against
doctrinal
errors
more
fundamental
than
its
own
''
.
That
day
is
perhaps
today
,
1961
,
and
it
seems
no_longer
very
meaningful
to
call
England
a
``
Protestant
country
''
.
One
of
the
ironies
of
the
present
crusade
for
Christian
unity
is
that
there
are
not
,
relatively
speaking
,
many
real
Christians
to
unite
.
Many
English
Catholics
are
proud
of
their
Catholicism
and
know
that
they
are
in
a
new
ascendancy
.
The
London_Universe
devoted
its
centenary
issue
last
December
8
to
mapping_out
various
aspects
of
Catholic
progress
during
the
last
one_hundred
years
.
With
traditional
nationalistic
spirit
,
some
Englishmen
claim
that
English
Catholicism
is
Catholicism
at
its
best
.
I
have
found
myself
saying
with
other
foreigners
here
that
English
Catholics
are
good
Catholics
.
It
has
been
my
experience
to
find
as
many
men
as
women
in
church
,
and
to
hear
almost
everyone
in
church
congregations
reciting
the
Latin
prayers
and
responses
at
Mass
.
They
hope
,
of_course
,
to
reclaim
the
non-Catholic
population
to
the
Catholic
faith
,
and
at
every
Sunday
Benediction
they
recite
by_heart
the
``
Prayer_for_England
''
:
``
O
Blessed
Virgin_Mary
,
Mother
of
God
and
our
most
gentle
queen
and
mother
,
look
down
in
mercy
upon
England
,
thy
''
dowry
``
,
and
upon
us
all
who
greatly
hope
and
trust
in
thee
.
Intercede
for
our
separated
brethren
,
that
with
us
in
the
one
true
fold
they
may
be
united
to
the
chief
Shepherd
,
the
vicar
of
thy
Son
''
.
A
hymn
often
to
be
heard
in
Catholic
churches
is
``
Faith_of_our_Fathers
''
,
which
glories
in
England
's
ancient
faith
that
endured
persecution
,
and
which
proclaims
:
``
Faith
of
our
Fathers
:
Mary
's
prayers
/
Shall
win
our
country
back
to
thee
''
.
The
English
saints
are
widely
venerated
,
quite
naturally
,
and
now
there
is
great
hope
that
the
Forty_Martyrs
and
Cardinal_Newman
will
soon
be
canonized
.
Because
they
have
kept
the
faith
of
their
medieval
fathers
,
English
Catholics
have
always
strongly
resented
the
charge
of
being
``
English
''
.
I
have
not
seen
this
charge
made
during
my
stay
here
,
but
apparently
it
is
still
in_the_air
.
For_example
,
a
writer
in
a
recent
number
of
The_Queen
hyperbolically
states
that
``
of
the
myriad
imprecations
the
only
one
which
the
English
Catholics
really
resent
is
the
suggestion
that
they
are
'
un
English
''
'
.
In
this
connection
,
it
has
been
observed
that
the
increasing
number
of
Irish
Catholics
,
priests
and
laity
,
in
England
,
while
certainly
seen
as
good
for
Catholicism
,
is
nevertheless
a
source
of
embarrassment
for
some
of
the
more
nationalistic
English
Catholics
,
especially
when
these
Irishmen
offer
to
remind
their
Christian
brethren
of
this
good
.
One
of
the
more
noteworthy
changes
that
have
taken_place
since
the
mid
19th
century
is
the
situation
of
Catholics
at
Oxford
and
Cambridge_Universities
.
At
Oxford
one_hundred
years
ago
there
were
very
few
Catholics
,
partly
because
religious
tests
were
removed
only
in
1854
.
Moreover
,
for
those
few
there
was
almost
no
ecclesiastical
representation
in
the
city
to
care
for
their
religious
needs
.
Now
,
not_only
are
there
considerably
more
laity
as
students
and
professors
at
Oxford
,
but
there
are
also
numerous
houses
of
religious_orders
existing
in
respectable
and
friendly
relations
with
the
non_Catholic
members
of
the
University
.
Some
Catholic
priests
lecture
there
;
Catholic
seminarians
attend
tutorials
and
row
on
the
Cherwell
with
non-Catholic
students
.
Further
evidence
that
Roman_Catholicism
enjoys
a
more
favorable_position
today
than
in
1861
is
the
respectful
attention
given
to_it
in
the
mass_media
of
England
.
The
general
tone
of
articles
appearing
in
such
important
newspapers
as
the
Manchester_Guardian
and
the
Sunday_Observer
implies
a
kindly
recognition
that
the
Catholic_Church
is
now
at_least
of
equal
stature
in
England
with
the
Protestant
churches
.
On
successive
Sundays
during
October
,
1960
,
Paul_Ferris
(
a
non-Catholic
)
wrote
articles
in
the
Observer
depicting
clergymen
of
the
Church_of_England
,
the
Church_of_Rome
and
the
Nonconformist_Church
.
The
Catholic
priest
,
though
somewhat
superficially
drawn
,
easily
came_out
the
best
.
There
were
many
letters
of
strong
protest
against
the
portrait
of
the
Anglican
clergyman
,
who
was
indeed
portrayed
as
a
man
not
particularly
concerned
with
religious
matters
and
without
really
very_much
to
do
as
clergyman
.
Such
a
series
of
articles
was
certainly
never
printed
in
the
public_press
of
mid
Victorian
England
.
There
was
so
much
interest
shown
in
this
present-day
venture
that
it
was
continued
on
B.B.C.
,
where
comments
were
equally
made
by
an
Anglican
parson
,
a
Free_Church
minister
and
a
Catholic
priest
.
Catholic
priests
have
frequently
appeared
on
television_programs
,
sometimes
discussing
the
Christian
faith
on
an
equal
footing
with
Protestant
clergymen
.
A
notable
example
of
this
was
the
discussion
of
Christian
unity
by
the
Catholic
Archbishop
of
Liverpool
,
Dr._Heenan
,
and
the
Anglican
Archbishop
of
York
,
Dr._Ramsey
,
recently
appointed
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
.
The
good
feeling
which
exists
between
these
two
important
church
figures
is
now
well_known
in
England
.
The
Holy_Sacrifice
of
the
Mass
with
commentary
has
been
televised
several
times
in
recent
months
.
And
it
was
interesting
to
observe
that
B.B.C.
.
's
television
film
on
Christmas_Eve
was
The_Bells_of_St._Mary's
.
Of_course
,
the
crowning
event
that
has
dramatically
upset
the
traditional
pattern
of
English
religious
history
was
the
friendly
visit
paid
by
Dr._Fisher
,
then
Anglican
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
to
the
Vatican
last
December
.
It
was
the
first
time
an
English
Primate
has
done
this
since
the
14th
century
.
English
Catholics
reacted
to
this
event
with
moderate
but
real
hope
.
Almost
daily
something
is
reported
which
feeds
this
Catholic
hope
in
England
:
statistics
of
the
increasing
numbers
of
converts
and
Irish
Catholic
immigrants
;
news
of
a
Protestant
minister
in
Leamington
who
has
offered
to
allow
a
Catholic
priest
to
preach
from
his
pulpit
;
a
report
that
a
Catholic
nun
had
been
requested
to
teach
in
a
non-Catholic
secondary_school
during
the
sickness
of
one
of
its
masters
;
the
startling
statement
in
a
respectable
periodical
that
``
Catholics
,
if
the
present
system
is
still
in_operation
,
will
constitute
almost
one-third
of
the
House_of_Lords
in
the
next
generation
''
;
a
report
that
200
Protestant
clergymen
and
laity
attended
a
votive
Mass
offered
for
Christian
unity
at
a
Catholic_church
in
Slough
during
the
Church
Unity
Octave
.
