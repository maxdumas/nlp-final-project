I
realized
that
Hamlet
was
faced
with
an
entirely
different
problem
,
but
his
agony
could
have
been
no
greater
.
The_most
that
was
accomplished
was
adding
Mrs._Beige
's
tray
to
the
dish
pile
,
and
by
means
of
repeated
threats
,
on
an
ascending
scale
,
seeing
that
the
girls
dressed
themselves
,
after_a_fashion
.
I
was
saved
from
making
the
decision
as
the
phone
rang
,
and
the
girls
were
upon
me
instantly
.
Here
's
a
household
hint
:
if
you
can
n't
find
your
children
,
and
get
tired
of
calling
them
,
pick_up
the
phone
.
No_matter
if
your
children
are
at
the
movies
,
in
school
,
visiting
their
grandmother
,
or
on
a
field
trip
in
some
distant
city
,
they
will
be
upon
you
magically
within
seconds
after
you
pick_up
the
phone
.
Jennie
and
Miranda
twined
themselves
around
me
,
murmuring
endearments
.
Louise
climbed
onto
a
stool
and
clutched
the
hand
with
which
I
was
trying
to
hold
the
phone
,
claiming
my
immediate
attention
on
grounds
of
extreme
emergency
.
Somehow
managing
to
get_out
a
cool
,
poised
,
``
Wo
n't
you
hold_on
a
second
,
please
''
,
I
covered
up
the
mouthpiece
,
and
with
more
warmth
and
less
poise
,
gave
a
quick
lecture
on
crime
and
punishment
,
mostly
the
latter
,
including
Devil
's
Island
and
the
remoter
reaches
of
Siberia
.
I
promised
to
illustrate
the
lecture
,
if
they
so_much
as
breathed
till
after
the
call
was
completed
.
Speaking
into
the
phone
again
and
recognizing
the
caller
,
I
resumed
my
everyday
voice
.
Soon
we
were
deep
in
a
conversation
that
was
interrupted
many_times
by
little
things
like
Jennie
's
holding
her
breath
and
pretending
to
black_out
,
Miranda
's
dumping
the
contents
of
the
sugar_bowl
on
the
table
,
and
various
screeches
,
thuds
,
and
giggles
.
Under_the_circumstances
,
I
had
difficulty
keeping_up
with
the
conversation
on
the
phone
,
but
when
I
hung_up
I
was
reasonably
certain
that
Francesca
had
wanted
to
remind
me
of
our
town_meeting
the
next
evening
,
and_how
important
it
was
that
Hank
and
I
be
there
.
I
discovered
that
the
girls
had
shrewdly
vacated
the
kitchen
,
and
were
playing
quietly
in
the
living_room
.
It
seemed
that
I
would
be
the
gainer
if
I
accepted
the
peace
and
quiet
,
instead
of
carrying_out
my
threats
.
Resolving
to
get
something
done
,
I
started
in
on
the
dishes
.
No
.
I
'm
not
saying
it
right
.
What
I
meant
to
say
was
that
I
started
to
start
in
on
the
dishes
by
gathering
them
all_together
in
the
kitchen_sink
.
They
looked
so
formidable
,
however
,
so
demanding
,
that
I
found
myself
staring
at
them
in
dismay
and
starting
to
woolgather
again
,
this
time
about
Francesca
and
her
husband
.
How
about
them
,
I
thought
.
Francesca
and
Herbert
were
among
the
few
people
we
knew
in
Catatonia
.
We
did
n't
even
know
them
till
about
a
month
after
we
moved
-
at_that_time
,
they
had
called
on
us
,
after
I
met
Fran
at
a
PTA
meeting
,
and
had
taken
us
in_hand
socially
.
They
had
been
kind
to
us
and
we
were
indebted
to
them
for
one
or
two
pleasant
dinners
,
and
for
information
as
to
where
to
shop
,
which
dentist
,
doctor
,
plumber
,
and
sitter
to
call
(
not
that
there
was
much
of
a
choice
,
since
Catatonia
was
just
a
village
;
the
yellow_pages
of
the
telephone_book
were
amazingly
thin
)
.
They
were
``
personalities
''
.
Herb
,
an
expert
on
narrow
ties
,
thin
lapels
,
and
swatches
,
was
men
's
fashion
editor
of
Parvenu
,
the
weekly
magazine
with
the
tremendous
circulation
.
Fran
and
he
had
met
about
two
years
after
she
had
arrived
in
Manhattan
from
Nebraska
,
or
was
it
Wyoming
?
She
was
the
daughter
and
sole
heiress
of
either
a
cattle
baron
or
an
oil
millionaire
and
,
having
arrived
in
New_York
with
a
big
bank
roll
,
became
a
dabbler
in
various
fields
.
She
patronized
Greenwich_Village
artists
for
awhile
,
then
put
some
money
into
a
Broadway
show
which
was
successful
(
terrible
,
but
successful
)
.
It
was
during
her
``
writing
''
period
that
she
and
Herb
met
and
decided
that
they
were
in_love
.
They
were
married
at
a
lavish
ceremony
which
was
duly
recorded
in
Parvenu
and
all
other
magazines
and
newspapers
,
and_then
they
honeymooned
in
Bermuda
.
No
,
not
Bermuda
.
Bermuda
was
not
in_style
that
year
.
They
had
honeymooned
in
Rome
;
everyone
was
very
high
on
Rome
that
year
.
They
had
bought
their
house
in
Catatonia
after
investigating
all
the
regions
of
suburbia
surrounding
New_York
;
they
had
chosen
Catatonia
because
of
its
reputation
for
excellent
schools
,
beaches
,
and
abundance
of
names
.
``
You
are
bound_to
get
involved
with
people
when
you
have
children
''
,
Fran
had
told
me
at
our
first
meeting
,
``
so
it
is
good
to
know
that
those
with
whom
you
get
involved
are
not
just
dreary
little
housewives
and
dull
husbands
,
but
People
Who
Do
Things
''
.
I
admired
their
easy
way
of
doing
things
but
I
could
n't
escape
an
uneasiness
at
their
way
of
always
doing
the
right
things
.
Their
house
was
a
centuries-old
Colonial
which
they
had
had
restored
(
guided
by
an
eminent
architect
)
and
updated
,
and
added_on
to
.
It
had
a
gourmet
's
corner
(
instead
of
a
kitchen
)
,
a
breakfast
room
,
a
luncheon
room
,
a
dining_room
,
a
sitting_room
,
a
room
for
standing_up
,
a
party
room
,
dressing_rooms
for
everybody
,
even
a
room
for
mud
.
It
was
all
set_up
so
there
would
be
no
dust
anywhere
and
so_that
their
children
would
color
in
the
coloring
room
,
paint
in
the
painting
room
,
play
with
blocks
in
the
block
house
,
and
do
all
the
other
things
in
the
proper
rooms
at
exactly
the
right
time
.
Their
two
boys
were
``
well
adjusted
''
and
,
like
their
parents
,
always
did
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
and
damn
the
consequences
.
Francesca
and
Herbert
considered
themselves
violently
nonconformist
and
showed
the
world
they
were
by
filling
their
Colonial
house
with
contemporary
furniture
and
paintings
and
other
art
objects
(
expensive
,
but
not
necessarily
valuable
,
contemporary
things
)
.
Fran
flaunted
her
independence
by
rebelling
against
the
Catatonia
uniform
of
Bermuda_shorts
and
knee-length
socks
by
wearing
Bermuda_shorts
and
knee-length
socks
in
color
;
bright
pinks
and
plaids
and
vivid
stripes
.
Sometimes
she
even
wore
the
uniform
in
solid
,
unrelieved
black
,
and
with
her
blonde
hair
cut
so
closely
,
wearing
this
uniform
,
she
strongly
resembled
a
member
of
the
SS.
.
No
one
could
dislike
them
,
I
thought
.
Sometimes
,
though
,
they
did
not
seem
quite
human
.
It
seemed
,
indeed
,
that
their
house
was
not
so_much
a
home
,
but
rather
a
perfect
stage_set
,
and
that
they
were
actors
who
had
been
handed
fat
roles
in
a
successful
play
,
and
had
talent
enough
to
fill
the
roles
competently
,
with
nice
understatement
.
Practically
the
only
enthusiasm
they
showed
was
when
they
were
discussing
``
names
''
;
even
brand
names
.
You
should
hear
the
reverence
in
Fran
's
voice
when
she
said
``
Baccarat
''
or
``
Steuben
''
or
``
Madame_Alexander
''
.
She
always
let
it
be
known
that
there
was
wine
in
the
pot_roast
or
that
the
chicken
had
been
marinated
in
brandy
,
and
that
Koussevitzky
's
second_cousin
was
an
intimate
of
theirs
.
I
would
n't
have
wasted
time
puzzling_over
this
couple
were
it
not
for
my
fear
that
all
the
other
inhabitants
of
Catatonia
were
equally
unreal
.
I
could
n't
feel
at_home
among
them
.
Besides
Francesca
,
there
was
Blanche
.
Francesca
was
pleasant
and
charming
,
but
Blanche
was
sweet
.
Yes
,
Blanche
was
very
,
very
sweet
-
being
in
her
company
was
like
being
drowned
in
warm
,
melted
marshmallows
.
I
had
once
been
a
witness
when
Blanche
had
smiled
and
said
with
only
minimum
ruefulness
,
``
Oh
,
my
souffle
has
collapsed
''
.
Anyone
knows
how
a
real
,
red-blooded
woman
would
react
to
such
a
catastrophe
!
If
Blanche
had
been
honest
,
she
would
have
yelled
,
slammed
at_least
a_couple_of
doors
,
and
thrown
a_few
little
,
valueless
things
.
But
dear
me
,
no
;
not
Blanche
.
After
five
minutes
with
Blanche
,
one
might
welcome
the
astringency
of
Grazie
,
who
was
a
sort_of
Gwen_Cafritz
to
Francesca
's
Perle_Mesta
.
Francesca
and
Grazie
were
habitual
committee
chairmen
and
they
usually
managed
to
be
elected
co-chairmen
,
equal
bosses
,
of
whatever
PTA
or
civic
project
was
being
launched
.
They
were
inseparable
,
not
because
they
were
fond
of
each
other
,
but
because
they
wanted
to
keep_an_eye_on
each
other
,
as
they
were
keen
rivals
for
social
leadership
.
Grazie
was
mean
:
quietly
mean
,
and
bitterly
,
unfunnily
sarcastic
.
She
it
was
who
had
looked
to
see
if
I
was
wearing
shoes
upon
learning
that
I
could
n't
drive
.
Grazie
had
a
small
,
slick
head
and
her
hair
and
skin
were
the
color
of
golden
toast
.
She
lived
in
an
ultra-modern
house
whose
decoration
,
appointments
,
paint
,
and
even
pets
were
chosen
to
complement
her
coloring
;
the
pets
were
a_couple_of
Siamese_cats
.
Her
uniform
was
of
rich
,
raw
silk
,
in
a
shade
which
matched
her
hair
,
skin
,
housepaint
,
and
cats
,
and
since
she
was
so
thin
as
to
be
almost
shapeless
,
she
rather
resembled
a
frozen
fish_stick
.
The
husbands
of
these
women
and_others
I
had
met
in
Catatonia
were
distinguished
only
in_that
they
were
,
to
me
at_least
,
indistinguishable
.
I
could
n't
tell
one
from
the
other
.
Like
Herbert
,
they
were
all_in
communications
:
radio
,
television
,
magazines
,
and
advertising
.
One
or
two
were
writers
of
books
;
all
were
fellows
of
finite
charm
.
Each
had
developed
a
hair-trigger
chuckle
and
the
habit
of
saying
``
zounds
''
!
in
deference
to
country-squirehood
.
I
never
thought
I
'd
live
to
hear
people
chuckle
and
say
``
zounds
''
!
in
real_life
.
I
would
n't
have
missed
it
for_anything
.
They
were
``
sincere
''
-
men
of
the
too-hearty
handclasp
and
the
urgent
smile
.
These
boys
acknowledged
an
introduction
to
anybody
by
gently
pressing
one
of
his
hands
in
both
of
theirs
,
while
they
gazed
,
misty-eyed
with
care
,
into
the
eyes
of
the
person
they
were
meeting
.
Could
such
unadulterated
love
,
for
a
total
stranger
,
be
credited
?
They
were
always
leaping
to
light
cigarettes
,
open
car_doors
,
fill
plates
or
glasses
,
and
I
mistrusted
the
whole
lot
of
them
to
the
same
degree
that
I
mistrusted
bake
shops
that
called
themselves
``
Sanitary_Bake
Shops
''
.
``
O
Pioneers
!
''
I
thought
,
and
wondered
what
kind_of
homesteads
such
odd
pioneers
would
establish
in_this
suburban
frontier
;
pioneers
who
looked_like
off-duty
gardeners
even
at
parent-teacher
conferences
and
who
never
called
the
school_principal
``
Mister
''
.
I
sighed
,
thinking
that
among_other_things
,
people
here
seemed
to
be
those
who
would
have
to
cut_down
if
they
earned
less_than
$
85000
yearly
;
people
who
would
give
their
teeth
for
a
chance
to
get_on
``
Person
to
Person
''
;
people
who
thought
it
was
nice
to
be
important
,
but
not
important
to
be
nice
;
who
were
more
ingratiating
than
gracious
,
more
personalities
than
persons
.
In
my
estimation
,
they
were
people
who
read
Daphne_du_Maurier
,
and
discussed
Kafka
;
well
,
not
discussed
him
exactly
,
but
said
,
``
Kafka
''
!
reverently
and
raised
their
eyes
,
as
if
they
were
at_a_loss
to
describe
how
they
felt
about
Kafka
,
which
they
were
,
because
they
had
no
opinions
about
Kafka
,
not
having
read
Kafka
.
They
were
,
I
felt
,
people
invariably
trying
to
prove
not
who
,
but
what
they
were
,
and
trying
to
determine
what
,
not
who
,
others
were
.
Becoming
aware
that
it
was
nearly
lunchtime
,
I
brought
myself
back
to
the
tasks
at_hand
.
I
made
plans
for
the
afternoon
-
doing
the
breakfast
and
luncheon
dishes
all_at_once
,
making
the
beds
,
and_then
maybe
painting
the
kitchen
.
Then
,
I
remembered
that
the
girls
had
had
a
banana
for
dessert
every_day
for
the
last
week
.
``
Bananas
''
!
Jennie
had
shouted
each
time
.
``
They
're
not
dessert
!
They
're
not
even
food
.
They
're
just
something
you
're
supposed
to
put
on
cereal
for
breakfast
''
.
I
dug
around
and
found
a
mix
,
and
was
able
to
surprise
them
with
a
devil
's
-
food
cake
with
chocolate
icing
.
(
Sometimes
I
think
you
need
only
one
rule
for
cooking
:
if
you
can
n't
put
garlic
in
it
,
put
chocolate
in
it
.
)
The
cake
was
received
in
a
stunned
silence
that
was
evidence
in
itself
of
the
dearth
of
taste
thrills
Mama
had
been
providing
.
Then
Jennie
closed
her
eyes
,
stretched_forth
her
arms
,
and
said
:
``
Take
my
hand
,
Louise
;
I
'm
a
stranger
in
paradise
''
.
