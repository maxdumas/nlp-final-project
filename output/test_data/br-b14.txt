This
is
the
period
during
the
melancholy
days
of
autumn
when
universities
and
colleges
schedule
what
they
call
``
Homecoming
Day
''
.
They
seek
thereby
to
lure
the
old
grad
back
to
the
old
scenes
.
The
football
opponent
on
homecoming
is
,
of_course
,
selected
with
the
view
that
said
opponent
will
have
little
more
chance
than
did
a
Christian
when
thrown
to
one
of
the
emperor
's
lions
.
It
is
true
,
of_course
,
the
uncertainties
of
life
being
what
they
are
,
that
as
now_and_then
the
Christian
killed
the
lion
,
homecoming
days
have
been
ruined
by
a
visiting
team
.
Even
with
all
possible
precaution
,
homecomings
are
usually
rather
cruel
and
sad
,
and
only
the
perpetually
ebullient
and
the
continually
optimistic
are
made
happy
by
them
.
More_often_than_not
,
as
the
Old_Grad
wanders
along
the
old
paths
,
his
memory
of
happy
days
when
he
strolled
one
of
the
paths
with
a
coed
beside
him
becomes
an
ache
and
a
pain
.
He
can
smell
again
the
perfume
she
wore
and
recall
the
lilting
sound
of
laughter
,
and
can
smell
again
the
aroma
of
autumn
-
fallen
leaves
,
the
wine
of
cool
air
,
and
the
nostalgia
of
woodsmoke
which
blows
through
all
the
winds
of
fall
.
It
is
at
precisely
such
moments
that
he
encounters
a_couple_of
undergraduates
,
faces
alight
,
holding
hands
and
talking
happily
as
they
come_along
,
oblivious_of
him
,
or
throwing
him
the_most
fleeting
and
casual
of
glances
,
such_as
they
would
give
a
tethered
goat
.
Usually
,
they
titter
loudly
after
they
have
passed_by
.
His
dream
goes
.
He
feels
,
suddenly
,
the
weight
of
the
fat
is
on
him
.
His
bridgework
or
his
plates
feel
loose
and
monstrous
.
His
bifocals
blur
.
His
legs
suddenly
feel
heavy
and
unaccountably
weary
,
as
if
he
had
walked
for
miles
,
instead
of
strolling
a_few
hundred
yards
along
the
old
campus
paths
.
Bitterness
comes_over
him
and
the
taste
of
time
is
like
unripe
persimmons
in
his
mouth
.
It
is
not_much
better
if
he
meets
with
old
classmates
.
Too
often
,
unless
he
hails
them
,
they
pass
him
by
.
He
recalls
with
a
wry
smile
the
wit
who
said
,
on
returning
from
a
homecoming
reunion
,
that
he
would
never
go
again
because
all
his
class
had
changed
so_much
they
did
n't
even
recognize
him
.
If
they
do
meet
and
recognize
one
another
,
slap
backs
and
embrace
,
the
moment
soon
is
done
.
After_all
,
when
one
has
asked
whatever
became
of
old
Joe
and
Charlie
;
when
one
has
inquired
who
it
was
Sue_Brown
married
and
where
it
is
they
now
live
;
when
questions
are
asked
and
answered
about
families
and
children
;
and
old
professors
;
when
the
game
and
its
probable
outcome
has
been
exhausted
;
that
does_it
.
By
then
one
begins
to
notice
the
middle-age
spread
;
the
gray
hairs
,
the
eyeglasses
,
bodies
that
are
too
thin
or
too
heavy
;
the
fading
signs
of
old
beauty
;
the
athlete
of
by-gone
years
who
wears
a
size
46
suit
and
puffs
when
he
has
finished
a
sentence
of
any
length
;
then
,
it
is
time
to
break
it
up
and
move_on
.
It
is
,
if
anything
,
worse
on
the
old
player
.
He
sits
in
the
stands
and
he
does
n't
like
that
.
Enough
of
his
life
was
spent
there
on
the
field
for
him
never
to
like
watching
the
game
as
a
spectator
in
the
crowd
.
He
always
feels
lonely
.
A
team
feels
something
.
On
a
team
a
man
feels
he
is
a
part
of_it
and
akin
to
the
men
next
to
him
.
In
the
stands
he
is
lonely
and
lost
,
no_matter_how
many
are
about
him
.
He
sits
there
remembering
the
tense
moment
before
the
ball
was
snapped
;
the
churning
of
straining
feet
,
the
rasp
of
the
canvas
pants
;
the
smell
and
feel
of
hot
,
wet
woolen
sleeves
across
his
face
.
He
remembers
the
desperate
,
panting
breath
;
the
long_runs
on
the
kick-offs
;
the
hard
,
jolting
tackles
;
the
breakthrough
;
the
desperate
agony
of
goal-line
stands
.
And
so
,
he
squirms
with
each
play
,
remembering
his
youth
.
But
it
is
no
use
.
It
is
gone
.
No_matter_how
often
a
man
goes_back
to
the
scenes
of
his
youth
and
strength
,
they
can
never
be
recaptured
again
.
Since
the
obvious
is
not
always
true
,
the
Republican_National_Committee
wisely
analyzed
its
defeat
of
last
autumn
and
finds
that
it
occurred
,
as
suspected
,
in
the
larger
cities
.
Of
40
cities
with
populations
of
300000
and
more
,
Mr._Kennedy
carried
26
and
Mr._Nixon
14
.
There
are
eight
states
in_which
the
largest
urban
vote
can
be
the
balance_of_power
in
any
close
election
.
These
are
New_York
,
Pennsylvania
,
Michigan
,
Maryland
,
Missouri
,
New_Jersey
,
Illinois
and
Minnesota
.
In
1952
Mr._Eisenhower
won
all_but
Missouri
.
Yet
,
in
1960
all
eight
gave
majorities
to
Mr._Kennedy
.
Republican
research
broke_down
the
vote
in
Philadelphia
.
Mr._Nixon
,
despite
a
very
earnest
effort
to
capture
the
minority
groups
,
failed
to
do
so
.
His
visit
to
Warsaw
,
Poland
,
after
the
Russian
journey
in
the
summer
of
1959
was
expected
to
win
the
Polish
vote
which
,
in
several
cities
,
is
substantial
.
Yet
,
the
GOP
breakdown
discovered
that
in
Philadelphia_Mr._Nixon
received
but
21
per_cent
of
the
so-called
``
Polish
''
vote
;
30
per_cent
of
the
``
Irish
''
vote
,
and
18
per_cent
of
the
``
Negro
''
vote
.
A
GOP
``
task_force
'
committee
will
seek
to
find_out
how
its
party
may
win
support
from
the
ethnic
and
minority
groups
in
cities
.
The
task_force
might
make
a
start
in
Washington
with
Republican
congressional
leaders
.
These
gentlemen
already
have
done
the
party
harm
by
their
seeming
reluctance
to
vote
aid
for
the
depressed
areas
and
by
their
criticism
of
Mr._Kennedy
for
talking_about
a
recession
and
unemployment
.
This
error
was
compounded
by
declaring
the
recession
to
be
``
a
statistical
one
''
,
and
not
a
reality
.
The
almost
six
million
persons
without
jobs
and
the
two
million
working
part-time
do
not
consider
themselves
and
their
plight
as
statistical
.
They
did
not
view
the
tour
of
the
distressed
cities
and
towns
by
Secretary
of
Labor_Goldberg
as
politics
,
which
the
GOP
declared
it
to
be
.
The
people
visited
were
glad
to
have
a
government
with
heart
enough
to
take
an
interest
in
their
misery
.
Senator_Mundt
's
gross
distortion
of
President_Eisenhower
's
conversation
into
a
denunciation
of
President_Kennedy
as
too
left_wing
,
a
statement
Mr._Eisenhower
declared
to
be
entirely
false
,
is
another
case_in_point
.
If
the
Republicans
and
Southern
Democrats
join
to
defeat
medical_care
for
the
old
under
the
Social_Security
program
,
they
will
thereby
erect
still
another
barrier
to
GOP
hopes
in
the
cities
.
The
present
Republican
leadership
as
practiced
by
Mundt
,
Goldwater
,
Bridges
,
Dirksen
,
et
al
,
is
repeating
the
errors
of
the
party
leadership
of
the
1930
s
.
In_that
decade
the
partisan
zeal
to
defend
Mr._Hoover
,
and
the
party
's
failure
to
anticipate
or
cope_with
the
depression
,
caused
a
great
majority
of
Americans
to
see
the
Republican_party
as
cold
and
lacking
in
any
sympathy
for
the
problems
of
human_beings
caught_up
in
the
distress
and
suffering
brought_on
by
the
economic
crash
.
The
Republican_party
was
not
lacking
in
humanity
,
but
it
permitted
its
extremely
partisan
leadership
to
make
it
appear
devoid_of
any
consideration
for
people
in_trouble
.
Farmers
called
their
mule-drawn
pickup_trucks
``
Hoover
carts
''
.
Smokers
reduced
to
``
the
makings
''
,
spoke
of
the
sack
tobacco
as
``
Hoover
dust
''
.
One
may
be
sure
the
present
Republican
congressional
leadership
has
n't
meant
to
repeat
this
error
.
But
it
is
in
the
process
of
so
doing
because
it
apparently
gives
priority
to
trying
to
downgrade
John_F._Kennedy
.
That
this
is
not
good
politics
is
underscored
by
the
latest
poll
figures
which
show
that
72
per_cent
of
the
people
like
the
way
in_which
the
new
President
is
conducting
the
nation
's
business
.
The_most
articulate
Republicans
are
those
who
,
in
their
desire
to
get_back
at
Mr._Kennedy
,
already
have
created
the
image
of
a
Republican
leadership
which
is
reluctant
to
assist
the
distressed
and
the
unemployed
,
and
which
is
even
more
unwilling
to
help
old
people
who
need
medical_care
.
If
they
also
defeat
the
school
bill
,
the
GOP
task_force
won
n't
have
much
research
to
do
.
It
will
early
know
why
the
party
won
n't
win_back
city
votes
.
The
1962
General_Assembly
has
important
business
to
consider
.
The
tragedy
is
that
it
will
not
be
able
to
transact
that
business
in
any
responsible
manner
.
After
the
Griffin-Byrd
political
troup
has
completed
the
circuit
in
November
in
the
name
of
a
Pre-Legislative_Forum
,
this
is
going_to
be
the_most
politically
oriented
Legislature
in
history
.
Every
legislator
from
Brasstown_Bald
to
Folkston
is
going_to
have
his
every
vote
subjected
to
the
closest
scrutiny
as
a
test
of
his
political
allegiances
,
not
his
convictions
.
Hoped-for
legislative
action
on
adjustment
of
the
county
unit
system
stands
less
chance
than
ever
.
And
just
how
far
can
the
Legislature
go
toward
setting_up
a
self-insurance
system
for
the
state
in_the_midst
of
a
governor
's
race
``
?
How
unpartisan
will
be
the
recommendations
of
Lt._Gov._Garland_Byrd
's
Senate_Committee
on
Government_Operations
?
The
situation
already
was
bad
because
the
Legislature
moved
the
governor
's
race
forward
a_few
months
,
causing
the
campaigning
to
get_started
earlier
than
usual
.
But
when
former
Gov._Marvin_Griffin
and
Lt._Gov._Byrd
accepted
the
invitations
of
the
Georgia_State
Chamber_of_Commerce
to
join
the
tour
next
November
,
the
situation
was
aggravated
.
Neither
had
a
choice
other_than
to
accept
the
invitation
.
To
have
refused
would
have
been
political
suicide
.
And
it
may
be
that
one
or
both
men
actually
welcomed
the
opportunity
,
when
the
bravado
comments
are
cast_aside
.
The
Georgia_State
Chamber_of_Commerce
tried
to
guard
against
the
danger
of
eliminating
potential
candidates
.
It
wanted
the
State_Democratic_Executive_Committee
to
pick
the
``
serious
candidates
''
.
But
State_Party_Chairman_James_Gray
of
Albany
said
no
,
and
he
did
n't
mince
any
words
.
``
They
are
just
asking
too_much
''
,
he
said
.
We
can
n't
think_of
anyone
else
who
would
want
to
separate
serious
candidates
from
other
candidates
,
either
.
There
are
other
dangers
:
Politics
is
an
accelerating
game
.
``
If
an
opponent
accuses
you
of
lying
,
do
n't
deny
it
.
Say
he
is
a
horse
thief
''
,
runs
an
old
adage
.
These
men
are
spenders
.
If
either
one
ever
started
making
promises
,
there
is
no
telling
where
the
promises
would
end
.
Griffin
's
Rural_Roads_Authority
and
Byrd
's
60000
miles
of
county
contracts
would
look_like
pauper
's
oaths
.
The
trouble
is
that
at_first_glance
the
idea
looks_like
such
a
good
one
.
Why
not
have
them
travel
the
state
in
November
debating
?
It
would
present
a
forum
for
them
in
almost
every
community
.
But
further
thought
brings
the
shuddery
visions
of
a
governor
's
race
being
run
in
the
next
Legislature
,
the
spectre
of
big
spending
programs
,
the
ooze
of
mudslinging
before
the
campaign
should
even
begin
.
There
is
a
way_out
of_this
.
The
Chamber
has
not
arranged
a
pre-legislative
forum
.
It
has
arranged
a
campaign_for_governor
.
If
it
will
simply
delay
the
debates
until
the
qualifications
are
closed
next
spring
,
and_then
carry
all
the
candidates
on
a
tour
of
debates
,
it
can
provide
a
service
to
the
state
.
But
the
Legislature
should
be
granted
the
opportunity
to
complete
its
work
before
choosing_up
sides
for
the
race
.
Former
British
Prime_Minister
Attlee
says
Eisenhower
was
not
a
``
great
soldier
''
.
Ike
's
somewhat
like
George_Washington
.
Both
won
a
pretty
fair-sized
war
with
a
modest
assist
from
British
strategy
.
Congressmen
returning
from
recess
say
the
people
admire
President_Kennedy
so_much
,
they
're
even
willing
to
heed
his
call
to
sacrifice
-
and
give_up
his
program
.
Slogan
of
the
John_Birch_Society
:
``
Paddle
your
own
canoe
.
The
guy
who
makes
the
motor
boats
may
be
a
Communist
''
.
A
Republican
survey
says
Kennedy
won
the
'
60
election
on
the
religious
issue
.
Too
many
people
were
afraid
if
the
GOP
won
,
they
'd
have
to
spend
all
their
time
praying
.
