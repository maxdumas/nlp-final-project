Scotty
did
not
go_back
to
school
.
His
parents
talked
seriously
and
lengthily
to
their
own
doctor
and
to
a
specialist
at
the
University_Hospital
-
Mr._McKinley
was
entitled
to
a
discount
for
members
of
his
family
-
and
it
was
decided
it
would
be
best
for
him
to
take
the
remainder
of
the
term
off
,
spend
a_lot
of
time
in
bed
and
,
for
the
rest
,
do
pretty_much
as
he
chose
-
provided
,
of_course
,
he
chose
to
do
nothing
too
exciting
or
too
debilitating
.
His
teacher
and
his
school_principal
were
conferred_with
and
everyone
agreed
that
,
if
he
kept_up
with
a
certain
amount
of
work
at
home
,
there
was
little
danger
of
his
losing
a
term
.
Scotty
accepted
the
decision
with
indifference
and
did
not
enter
the
arguments
.
He
was
discharged
from
the
hospital
after
a
two
day
checkup
and
he
and
his
parents
had
what
Mr._McKinley
described
as
a
``
celebration
lunch
''
at
the
cafeteria
on
the
campus
.
Rachel
wore
a
smart
hat
and
,
because
she
had
been
warned
recently
about
smoking
,
puffed
at
her
cigarettes
through
a
long
ivory
holder
stained
with
lipstick
.
Scotty
's
father
sat
sprawled
in
his
chair
,
angular
,
alert
as
a
cricket
,
looking
about
at
the
huge
stainless-steel
appointments
of
the
room
with
an
expression
of
proprietorship
.
Teachers
-
men
who
wore
brown
suits
and
had
gray
hair
and
pleasant
smiles
-
came
to
their
table
to
talk_shop
and
to
be
introduced
to
Scotty
and
Rachel
.
Rachel
was
polite
,
Scotty
indifferent
.
They
ate
the
cafeteria
food
with
its
orange
sauces
and
Scotty
gazed
without
interest
at
his
food
,
the
teachers
,
the
heroic
baronial
windows
,
and
the
bright
ranks
of
college
banners
.
His
father
tried
to
make
the
food
a
topic
.
``
The
blueberry_pie
is
good
,
Scotty
.
I
recommend
it
''
.
He
looked
at
his
son
,
his
face
worried
.
Scotty
murmured
,
``
No
,
thanks
''
,
so
softly
his
father
had_to
bend
his
gaunt
height
across
the
table
and
turn
a
round
brown
ear
to
him
.
Scotty
regarded
the
ear
and
the
grizzled
hair
around
it
with
a
moment
of
interest
.
He
said
more
loudly
,
``
I'm
full
,
old
Pop
''
.
He
had
eaten
almost
nothing
on
the
crested
,
three
sectioned
plate
and
had
drunk
about
half
the
milk
in
its
paper
container
.
``
He's
all_right
,
Craig
''
,
Rachel
said
.
``
I
can
fix
him
something
later
in
the
afternoon
when
we
get
home
''
.
Since
his
seizure
,
Scotty
had
had
little
appetite
;
yet
his
changed
appearance
,
surprisingly
,
was
one
of
plumpness
.
His
face
was
fuller
;
his
lips
and
the
usually
sharp
lines
of
his
jaw
had
become
swollen
looking
.
He
breathed
now
with
his
mouth
open
,
showing
a
whitely
curving
section
of
lower
teeth
;
he
kept
his
eyes
,
with
their
puffed
blurred
lids
,
always
lowered
,
though
not
,
apparently
,
focusing
.
Even
his
neck
seemed
thicker
and
therefore
shorter
.
His
hands
,
which
had
been
as
quick
as
a
pair
of
fluttering
birds
,
were
now
neither
active
nor
really
relaxed
.
They
lay
on
his
lap
,
palms
up
,
stiffly
motionless
,
the
tapered
fingers
a_little
thick
at
the
joints
.
Altogether
he
had
,
since
the
seizure
,
the
appearance
of
a
boy
who
overindulged
in
food
and
took
no
exercise
.
He
looked
lazy
,
spoiled
,
a_little
querulous
.
Rachel
had
little
to
say
.
She
greeted
her
husband
's
colleagues
with
smiling
politeness
,
offering
nothing
.
Mr._McKinley
,
for
all
his
sprawling
and
his
easy
familiarity
,
was
completely
alert
to
his
son
,
eyes
always
on
the
still
face
,
jumping
to
anticipate
Scotty_'s
desires
.
It
was
a
strained
,
silent
lunch
.
Rachel
said
,
``
I
'd_better
get
him
to
bed
''
.
The
doctors
had
suggested
Scotty
remain
most
of
every
afternoon
in
bed
until
he
was
stronger
.
Since
Mr._McKinley
had
to
give
a
lecture
,
Rachel
and
Scotty
drove
home
alone
in
the
Plymouth
.
They
did
not
speak
much
.
Scotty
gazed
out
at
ugly
gray
slums
and
said
softly
,
``
Look
at
those
stupid
kids
''
.
It
was
a
Negro
section
of
peeling
row_houses
,
store-front
churches
and
ragged
children
.
Rachel
had
to
bend
toward
Scotty
and
ask
him
to
repeat
.
He
said
,
``
Nothing
''
.
And_then
:
``
There
are
lots
of
kids
around
here
''
.
Scotty
looked
at
the
children
,
his
mouth
slightly
opened
,
his
eyes
dull
.
He
felt
tired
and
full
and
calm
.
The
days
seemed
short
,
perhaps
because
his
routine
was
,
each_day
,
almost
the
same
.
He
rose
late
and
went_down
in
his
bathrobe
and
slippers
to
have
breakfast
either
alone
or
with
Rachel
.
Virginia
treated
him
with_attention
and
tried
to
tempt
his
appetite
with
special
food
:
biscuits
,
cookies
,
candies
-
the
result
of
devoted
hours
in
the
tiled
kitchen
.
She
would
hover
over
him
and
,
looking_like
her
brother
,
anxiously
watch
the
progress
of
Scotty
's
fork
or
spoon
.
``
You
do
n't
eat
enough
,
honey
.
Try
to
get
that
down
''
.
Rachel
,
observing
,
would
say
,
``
He
has_to
rediscover
his
own
capacity
.
It
'll
take
time
''
.
Virginia
and
Rachel
talked
to
each
other
quietly
now
,
as
allies
who
are
political
rather_than
natural
might
in
a
war
atmosphere
.
Both
watched
Scotty
constantly
,
Rachel
without
seeming
to
,
Virginia
openly
,
her
eyes
filled
with
concern
.
Scotty
was
neutral
.
He
did
not
resent
their
supervision
or
Virginia
's
sometimes
tiring
sympathy
.
He
ate
what
he
felt_like
,
slept
as
much
or
as
little
as
he
pleased
,
and
moved
about
the
draughty
rooms
of
the
house
,
when
he
was
not
in
bed
,
with
slow
dubious
steps
,
like
an
elderly
tourist
in
a
cathedral
.
His
energy
was
gone
.
He
was
able
,
now
,
to
sit
for
hours
in
a
chair
in
the
living_room
and
stare
out
at
the
bleak
yard
without
moving
.
His
hands
lay
loosely
,
yet
stiffly
-
they
were
like
wax
hands
:
almost
lifelike
,
not
quite
-
folded
in
his
lap
;
his
mouth
hung
slightly
open
.
When
he
was
asked
a
question
or
addressed
in
such
a
way
that
some
response
was
inescapable
,
he
would
answer
;
if
,
as
often
happened
,
he
had
to
repeat
because
he
had
spoken
too
softly
,
he
would
repeat
his
words
in
the
same
way
,
without
emphasis
or
impatience
,
only
a_little
louder
.
He
had
not
mentioned
Kate
.
He
had
not
even
thought_about
her
much
except
once
or
twice
at
night
in
bed
when
his
slowly
ranging
thoughts
would
abruptly
,
almost
accidentally
,
encounter
her
.
At
these
times
he
felt
a
kind
of
pain
in
his
upper
chest
,
but
it
was
an
objective
pain
,
in_no_way
different
from
others
in
intensity
and
not
different
in
kind
;
it
was
like
the
bandaged
wound
on
the
back
of
his
head
which
occasionally
throbbed
;
it
was
merely
another
part
of
his
weakness
.
He
was
calm
,
drugged
,
and
lazy
.
He
did
not
care
.
Rachel
mentioned
Kate
.
She
said
,
``
I
notice
the
girl
from
across
the
street
has
n't
bothered
to
phone
or
visit
''
.
Scotty
said
,
``
That
's
all_right
.
Kate
's
all_right
''
.
He
thought_about
it
briefly
,
then
deliberately
turned
the
talk
to
something
else
.
Once
,
sitting
at
the
front
window
in
his
parents
'
room
,
he
saw
Kate
come_out
of
her
house
.
She
was
with
Elizabeth
.
They
were
far
off
and
looked
tiny
.
The
heavy
branches
in
his
front_yard
would
hide
and
then
reveal
them
.
They
turned
at
the
bottom
of
Kate
's
steps
and
moved
off
in
the
direction
of
the
park
.
He
thought
he
saw
-
it
awakened
and
,
for
a
moment
,
interested
him
-
that
Elizabeth
held
a
leash
in
her
hand
and
that
a
round
fuzzy
puppy
was
on
the
end
of
the
leash
.
Then
they
disappeared
and
Scotty
got_up
and
went_into
his
own
room
and
got_into_bed
.
By
the
time
he
was
under
the
covers
he
had
forgotten
about
seeing
Kate
.
The
doctor
,
since
Scotty
was
no_longer
allowed
to
make
his
regular
trips
into
town
to
see
him
,
came
often
and
informally
to
the
house
.
He
would
sit
,
slim-waisted
and
spare
,
on
the
edge
of
Scotty
's
bed
,
his
legs
crossed
so
elaborately
that
the
crossed
foot
could
tap
the
floor
.
Scotty
did
not
mind
the
doctor
's
unsmiling
teasing
as
he
used_to
.
``
Husky
young_man
''
,
he
said
with
mock
distaste
.
``
I
imagine
you
're
always
battling
in
school
''
.
``
I
do
n't
go_to
school
any_more
''
.
``
Pardon
''
?
The
doctor
had
to
bend
close
to
hear
;
his
delicate
hand
,
as
veined
as
a
moth
's
wing
,
rested
absently
on
Scotty
's
chest
.
Scotty
said
the
same
words
more
loudly
.
``
Oh
.
Well
,
we
're
taking
a
little
vacation
,
that
's
all
''
.
He
turned
unsmilingly
to
Rachel
.
``
I
think
by
the
end
of
next
week
he
could
get_out
in
the
air
a_little
.
He
could
now
but
the
weakness
is
very
definite
;
it
would
exhaust
him
further
and
unnecessarily
.
He
'll
be
stronger
soon
''
.
His
stethoscope
was
on
the
table
by
Scotty
's
bed
and
he
picked
it
up
and
wagged
it
at
Scotty
.
He
said
fussily
,
``
Just
keep
the
cap
on
those
strong
emotions
''
.
The
stethoscope
glinted
silver
in
the
darkening
room
.
``
I
'll
drop_by
again
in
a_few
days
''
.
Rachel
stayed_on
after
the
doctor
had
gone
.
She
smoothed
the
covers
on
Scotty
's
bed
and
picked
things
up
from
the
floor
.
She
did
not
touch
him
.
Scotty
watched
with
disinterest
.
He
did
not
speak
.
He
had
no
desire
to
.
She
said
,
``
Do
you
think
you
'll
miss
school
''
?
He
had
noticed
how
formal
and
irritably
exact
Rachel
had
grown
.
He
did
not
care
.
He
felt
her
irritability
did
not
concern
him
,
yet
he
knew
he
would
not
care
even
if
it
did
.
He
shook
his
head
.
``
We
've
had
any
number
of
calls
about
you
.
You
could
win
a
popularity_contest
at
that
school
without
any
trouble
.
Miss_Estherson
called
twice
.
She
wants
to
pay
you
a
visit
.
She
says
the
children
miss
you
.
Apparently
you
were
the
light
of
their
lives
''
.
Scotty
shrugged
slightly
.
Rachel
came
close
to
the
bed
,
bent
as
if
she
would
kiss
him
,
then
moved
away
.
She
was
frowning
.
``
That
doctor
annoys
me
''
.
She
seemed
to
speak_to
herself
.
``
Do
you
suppose
his
self-consciousness
is
characteristic
of
the
new
Negro
professionals
or
merely
of
doctors
in_general
''
?
She
turned_to
him
again
.
``
Well
,
Mrs._Charles_-
Sally
-
has
phoned
too
.
She
was
very
worried
''
.
Rachel
's
tone
was
dry
.
``
She
did
n't
really
say
''
-
She
glanced
away
at
the
floor
,
then
swooped
gracefully
and
picked_up
one
of
Scotty
's
slippers
.
``
I
mean
,
do
you
feel_like
seeing
Kate
''
?
Scotty
said
,
``
I
do
n't
know
''
.
It
was
true
.
He
did
not
.
There
was
the
slight
pain
,
but
it
was
no
different
from
the
throbbing
in
his
head
.
``
Well
,
there
's
time
,
in_any_case
.
We
'll
wait
till
you
're
stronger
and
then
talk_about
it
''
.
She
put
the
slipper
neatly
by
its
mate
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
Scotty
said
,
``
Okay
''
.
This
time
Rachel
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
forehead
.
Scotty
was
pleased
.
His
father
was
a
constant
visitor
.
Scotty
would
hear
the
front_door
in
the
evening
and
then
his
father
's
deep
slow
voice
;
it
floated
up
the
stairs
.
``
How
's
Scotty
''
?
And
Rachel
's
or
Virginia
's
reply
:
``
Better
.
He
's
getting
plenty
of
rest
''
.
``
Is
his
appetite
improved
''
?
Or
:
``
Does
he
get
exercise
''
?
The
exchange
was
almost
invariable
,
and
Scotty
,
in
his
bed
,
could
hear
every
word
of_it
.
He
never
smiled
.
It
required
an
energy
he
no_longer
possessed
to
be
satirical
about
his
father
.
His
father
would
come
upstairs
and
stand
self-consciously
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
look_at
his
son
.
After
a
pause
,
during
which
he
studied
Scotty
's
face
as
if
Scotty
were
not
there
and
could
not
study
him
too
,
Mr._McKinley
would
ask
the
same
questions
he
had
asked
downstairs
.
Scotty
would
reply
softly
and
his
father
,
apologetically
,
would
ask
him
to
repeat
.
``
I'm
eating
more
''
,
he
would
say
.
Or
:
``
I
walk_around
the
house
a_lot
''
.
``
Perhaps
you
should
get_out
a_little
''
.
``
I'm
not
supposed
to
yet
''
.
He
was
not
irritated
.
He
did
not
mind
the
useless
,
kindly
questions
.
He
looked
at
the
lined
face
with
vague
interest
;
he
felt
he
was
noting
it
,
as
if
it
were
something
he
might
think_about
when
he
grew
stronger
.
Mr._McKinley
examined
everything
with
critical
care
,
seeking
something
material
to
blame
for
his
son
's
illness
.
``
Have
you
got
enough
blankets
''
?
And
another
time
,
without
accusation
:
``
You
never
wore
that
scarf
I
bought
you
''
.
