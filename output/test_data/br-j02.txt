Experiments
were
made
on
an
electric
arc
applying
a
porous
graphite
anode
cooled
by
a
transpiring
gas
(
Argon
)
.
Thus
,
the
energy
transferred
from
the
arc
to
the
anode
was
partly
fed
back
into
the
arc
.
It
was
shown
that
by
proper
anode
design
the
net
energy
loss
of
the
arc
to
the
anode
could
be
reduced
to
approximately
15
%
of
the
total
arc
energy
A
detailed
energy
balance
of
the
anode
was
established
.
The
anode
ablation
could
be
reduced
to
a
negligible
amount
.
The
dependence
of
the
arc
voltage
upon
the
mass
flow
velocity
of
the
transpirating
gas
was
investigated
for
various
arc
lengths
and
currents
between
100
Amp
and
200
Amp
.
Qualitative
observations
were
made
and
high-speed
motion_pictures
were
taken
to
study
flow
phenomena
in
the
arc
at
various
mass
flow
velocities
.
The
high
heat
fluxes
existing
at
the
electrode
surfaces
of
electric
arcs
necessitate
extensive
cooling
to
prevent
electrode
ablation
.
The
cooling
requirements
are
particularly
severe
at
the
anode
.
In
free_burning
electric
arcs
,
for_instance
,
approximately
90
%
of
the
total
arc
power
is
transferred
to
the
anode
giving_rise
to
local
heat
fluxes
in
excess
of
**f
as
measured
by
the
authors
-
the
exact
value
depending_on
the
arc
atmosphere
.
In
plasma
generators
as
currently
commercially
available
for
industrial
use
or
as
high_temperature
research
tools
often
more
than
50
%
of
the
total
energy
input
is
being
transferred
to
the
cooling
medium
of
the
anode
.
The
higher
heat
transfer
rates
at
the
anode
compared
with
those
at
the
cathode
can
be
explained
by
the
physical_phenomena
occurring
in
free_burning
arcs
.
In
plasma
generators
the
superimposed
forced
convection
may
modify
the
picture
somewhat
.
The
heat
transfer
to
the
anode
is_due
to
the
following
effects
:
1
.
Heat_of_condensation
(
work
function
)
plus
kinetic_energy
of
the
electrons
impinging_on
the
anode
.
This
energy
transfer
depends_on
the
current
,
the
temperature
in
the
arc
column
,
the
anode
material
,
and
the
conditions
in
the
anode
sheath
.
2
.
Heat
transfer
by
molecular
conduction
as_well_as
by
radiation
from
the
arc
column
.
The
heat
transfer
to
the
anode
in
free_burning
arcs
is
enhanced
by
a
hot
gas_jet
flowing
from
the
cathode
towards
the
anode
with
velocities
up
**f
.
This
phenomenon
has
been
experimentally
investigated
in_detail
by
Maecker
(
Ref.
1
)
.
The
pressure
gradient
producing
the
jet
is_due
to
the
nature
of
the
magnetic_field
in
the
arc
(
rapid
decrease
of
current
density
from
cathode
to
the
anode
)
.
Hence
,
the
flow
conditions
at
the
anode
of
free_burning
arcs
resemble
those
near
a
stagnation
point
.
it
is
apparent
from
the
above
and
from
experimental
evidence
that
the
cooling
requirements
for
the
anode
of
free_burning
arcs
are
large
compared
with
those
for
the
cathode
.
The
gas
flow
through
a
plasma
generator
will
modify
these
conditions
;
however
,
the
anode
is
still
the
part
receiving
the
largest
heat
flux
.
An
attempt
to
improve
the
life
of
the
anodes
or
the
efficiency
of
the
plasma
generators
must
,
therefore
,
aim
at
a
reduction
of
the
anode
loss
.
The
following
possibilities
exist
for
achieving
this
:
1
.
The
use
of
high
voltages
and
low
currents
by
proper
design
to
reduce
electron
heat
transfer
to
the
anode
for
a
given
power
output
.
2
.
Continuous
motion
of
the
arc
contact
area
at
the
anode
by
flow
or
magnetic_forces
.
3
.
Feed_back
of
the
energy
transferred
to
the
anode
by
applying
gas
transpiration
through
the
anode
.
The
third
method
was
,
to
our
knowledge
,
successfully
applied
for_the_first_time
by
C._Sheer
and
co-workers
(
Ref.
2
)
.
The
purpose
of
the
present
study
is
to
study
the
thermal
conditions
and
to
establish
an
energy
balance
for
a
transpiration
cooled
anode
as_well_as
the
effect
of
blowing
on
the
arc
voltage
.
Gas
injection
through
a
porous
anode
(
transpiration
cooling
)
not_only
feeds_back
the
energy
transferred
to
the
anode
by
the
above
mentioned
processes
,
but
also
modifies
the
conditions
in
the
arc
itself
.
A
detailed
study
of
this
latter
phenomenon
was
not
attempted
in
this
paper
.
Argon
was
used
as
a
blowing_gas
to
exclude
any
effects
of
dissociation
or
chemical_reaction
.
The
anode
material
was
porous
graphite
.
Sintered
porous
metals
should
be
usable
in_principle
.
However
,
technical
difficulties
arise
by
melting
at
local
hot
spots
.
The
experimental
arrangement
as
described
below
is
based
on
the
geometry
of
free_burning
arcs
.
Thus
,
direct
comparisons
can
be
drawn
with
free_burning
arcs
which
have
been
studied
in_detail
during
the
past
years
and
decades
by
numerous
investigators
(
Ref.
3
)
.
Figures
1
to
3
show
photographic
and
schematic
views
of
the
test
stand
and
of
two
different
models
of
the
anode
holder
.
The
cathode
consisted_of
a
1/4
''
diameter
thoriated
tungsten
rod
attached
to
a
water_cooled
copper
tube
.
This
tube
could
be
adjusted
in
its
axial
direction
by
an
electric
drive
to
establish
the
required
electrode
spacing
.
The
anode
in
figure
2
was
mounted
by
means
of
the
anode
holder
which
was
attached
to
a
steel
plug
and
disk
.
The
transpiring
gas
ejected
from
the
anode
formed
a
jet
directed
axially
towards
the
cathode
below
.
Inflow
of
air
from
the
surrounding
atmosphere
was
prevented
by
the
two
disks
shown
in
figure
2
.
Argon
was
also
blown
at
low
velocities
(
mass
flow_rate
**f
)
through
a
tube
coaxial
with
the
cathode
as
an
additional
precaution
against
contamination
of
the
arc
by
air
.
The
anode
consisted_of
a
1/2
inch
diameter
porous
graphite
plug
,
1/4
inch
long
.
The
graphite
was
National_Carbon_NC
60
,
which
has
a
porosity
of
50
%
and
an
average
pore
size
of
30
This
small
pore
size
was
required
to
ensure
uniformity
of
the
flow
leaving
the
anode
.
The
anode
plug
(
Figure
2
)
was
inserted
into
a
carbon
anode
holder
.
A
shielded
thermocouple
was
used
to
measure
the
upstream
temperature
of
the
transpiring
gas
.
It
was
exposed
to
a
high
velocity
gas_jet
.
A
plug
and
a
tube
with
holes
in
its
cylindrical
walls
divided
the
chamber
above
the
porous
plug
into
two
parts
.
This
arrangement
had
the
purpose
to
prevent
heated
gas
to
reach
the
thermocouple
by
natural
convection
.
Two
pyrometers
shown
in
figure
1
and
2
(
Pyrometer_Instrument_Co.
Model
95
)
served
for
simultaneous
measurement
of
the
anode
surface
temperature
and
the
temperature
distribution
along
the
anode
holder
.
Three
thermocouples
were
placed
at
different
locations
in
the
aluminum
disk
surrounding
the
anode
holder
to
determine
its
temperature
.
Another
anode
holder
used
in
the
experiments
is
shown
in
figure
3
.
In
this
design
the
anode
holder
is
water_cooled
and
the
heat
losses
by
conduction
from
the
anode
were
determined
by
measuring
the
temperature
rise
of
the
coolant
.
To
reduce
heat
transfer
from
the
hot
gas
to
this
anode
holder
outside
the
region
of
the
arc
,
a
carbon
shield
was
attached
to
the
surface
providing
an
air
gap
of
1/16
inch
between
the
plate
and
the
surface
of
the
anode
holder
.
In_addition
,
the
inner
surface
of
the
carbon
shield
was
covered
with
aluminum_foil
to
reduce
radiation
.
Temperatures
of
the
shield
and
of
the
surface
of
the
water_cooled
anode
holder
were
measured
by
thermocouples
to
account_for
heat
received
by
the
coolant
but
not
originating
from
the
anode
plug
.
The
argon
flow
from
commercial
bottles
was
regulated
by
a
pressure
regulator
and
measured
with
a
gas
flow
rator
.
The
power
source
was
a
commercial
D.C.
rectifier
.
At
100
Amp
the
360
cycle
ripple
was
less_than
0.5
V
(
peak
to
peak
)
with
a
resistive
load
.
The
current
was
regulated
by_means_of
a
variable_resistor
and
measured
with
a
50
mV
shunt
and
millivoltmeter
.
The
arc
voltage
was
measured
with
a
voltmeter
whose
terminals
were
connected
to
the
anode
and
cathode
holders
.
Because
of
the
falling
characteristic
of
the
rectifier
,
no
ballast_resistor
was
required
for
stability
of
operation
.
A
high_frequency
starter
was
used
to
start
the
arc
.
The
anode
holder
shown
in
figure
2
was
designed
with
two
goals
in
mind
.
The
heat
losses
of
the
holder
were
to
be
reduced
as_far_as_possible
and
they
should
be
such_that
an
accurate
heat
balance
can
be
made
.
In_order
to
reduce
the
number
of
variable
parameters
,
all
experiments
were
made
with
a
constant
arc
length
of
0.5
''
and
a
current
of
100
Amp
.
The
argon
flow
through
the
porous
anode
was
varied
systematically
between
**f
.
and
**f
.
The
lower_limit
was
determined
by
the
fact
that
for
smaller
flow_rates
the
arc
started
to
strike
to
the
anode
holder
instead
of
to
the
porous
graphite
plug
and
that
it
became
highly
unstable
.
The
upper_limit
was
determined
by
the
difficulty
of
measuring
the
characteristic
anode
surface
temperature
(
see
below
)
since
only
a
small
region
of
the
anode
was
struck
by
the
arc
.
This
region
which
had
a
higher
temperature
than
the
rest
of
the
anode
surface
changed
size
and
location
continuously
.
For
each
mass
flow_rate
the
arc
voltage
was
measured
.
To
measure
the
surface
temperature
of
the
anode
plug
,
the
surface
was
scanned
with
a
pyrometer
.
As
it
turned_out
,
a
very
hot
region
occurred
on
the
plug
.
Its
temperature
was
denoted
by
**f
.
The
size
of
this
hot
region
was
estimated
by
eye
.
The
rest
of
the
surface
had
a
temperature
which
decreased
towards
the
outer
diameter
of
the
plug
.
The
mean
temperature
of
this
region
was
approximated
by
the
temperature
measured
halfways
between
the
edge
of
the
hot
spot
and
the
rim
of
the
plug
.
It
was
denoted
by
**f
.
The
mean
temperature
of
the
surface
was
then
computed
according
to
the
following
relation
:
**f
where
x
is
the
fraction
of
the
plug
area
covered
by
the
hot
spot
.
Assuming
thermal
equilibrium
between
the
anode
surface
and
the
transpiring
argon
,
the
gas
enthalpy
rise
through
the
anode
was
calculated
according_to
the
relation
**f
whereby
the
specific_heat
of
argon
was
taken
as
**f
.
This
calculation
results
in
an
enthalpy
rise
which
is
somewhat
high
because
it
assumes
a
mass
flow
equally
distributed
over
the
plug
cross_section
whereas
in_reality
the
mass
velocity
is
expected
to
be
smaller
in
the
regions
of
higher
temperatures
.
The
upstream
gas
temperature
measured
with
the
thermocouple
shown
in
figure
2
was
**f
.
The
**f
values
are
listed
in
Table
1
together
with
the
measured
surface
temperatures
and
arc
voltages
.
Simultaneously
with
the
anode
surface
temperature
and
voltage
measurements
pyrometer
readings
were
taken
along
the
cylindrical
surface
of
the
carbon
anode
holder
as
indicated
on
figure
2
.
Some
of
these
temperatures
are
plotted
in
figure
4
.
They
showed
no
marked
dependence
on
the
flow_rate
within
the
accuracy
of
these
measurements
.
Thus
,
the
dotted
line
shown
in
figure
4
was
taken
as
typical
for
the
temperature
distribution
for
all
blowing
rates
.
The
thermocouples
in
the
aluminum
disk
shown
in
figure
2
indicated
an
equilibrium
temperature
of
the
surface
of
**f
.
This
temperature
was
taken
as
environmental
temperature
to
which
the
anode
holder
was
exposed
as_far_as
radiation
is
concerned
.
It
is
sufficiently
small
compared
with
the
surface
temperature
of
the
anode
holder
,
to
make
the
energy
flux
radiated
from
the
environment
toward
the
anode
holder
negligible
within
the
accuracy
of
the
present
measurements
.
The
reflection
of
radiation
originating
from
the
anode
holder
and
reflected
back
to
it
by
the
surrounding
metal
surfaces
should
also
be
small
because
of
the
specular
characteristic
of
the
metal
surfaces
and
of
the
specific
geometry
.
The
total
heat
loss
through
the
anode
holder
included
also
the
heat
conducted
through
the
base
of
the
cylindrical
piece
into
the
adjacent
metal
parts
.
It
was
calculated
from
the
temperature_gradient
**f
at
**f
inch
as
**f
.
The
total
heat
flux
from
the
porous
plug
into
the
plug
holder
is
thereby
**f
The
temperature
distribution
of
figure
4
gives
**f
for
all
blowing
rates
,
assuming
**f
.
The
temperature
dependent
value
of
|e
was
taken
from
Ref.
7
.
The
radiation
loss
from
the
anode
surface
was
computed
according_to
**f
where
**f
is
the
mean
of
the
fourth
powers
of
the
temperatures
**f
and
**f
calculated
analogously
to
equation
(

)
.
