Several
defendants
in
the
Summerdale
police
burglary
trial
made
statements
indicating
their
guilt
at_the_time
of
their
arrest
,
Judge_James_B._Parsons
was
told
in
Criminal_court
yesterday
.
The
disclosure
by
Charles_Bellows
,
chief
defense
counsel
,
startled
observers
and
was
viewed_as
the
prelude
to
a
quarrel
between
the
six
attorneys
representing
the
eight
former
policemen
now
on
trial
.
Bellows
made
the
disclosure
when
he
asked
Judge_Parsons
to
grant
his
client
,
Alan_Clements
,
30
,
a
separate
trial
.
Bellows
made
the
request
while
the
all-woman
jury
was
out
of
the
courtroom
.
``
The
statements
may
be
highly
prejudicial
to
my
client
''
,
Bellows
told
the
court
.
``
Some
of
the
defendants
strongly
indicated
they
knew
they
were
receiving
stolen_property
.
It
is
impossible
to
get
a
fair
trial
when
some
of
the
defendants
made
statements
involving
themselves
and_others
''
.
Judge_Parsons
leaned
over
the
bench
and
inquired
,
``
You
mean
some
of
the
defendants
made
statements
admitting
this
''
?
``
Yes
,
your
honor
''
,
replied
Bellows
.
``
What
this
amounts
to
,
if
true
,
is
that
there
will
be
a
free-for-all
fight
in_this
case
.
There
is
a
conflict
among
the
defendants
''
.
President_Kennedy
today
pushed_aside
other
White_House
business
to
devote
all
his
time
and
attention
to
working_on
the
Berlin
crisis
address
he
will
deliver
tomorrow
night
to
the
American
people
over
nationwide
television
and
radio
.
The
President
spent
much
of
the
week-end
at
his
summer
home
on
Cape_Cod
writing
the
first
drafts
of
portions
of
the
address
with
the
help
of
White_House
aids
in
Washington
with
whom
he
talked
by
telephone
.
Shortly
after
the
Chief_Executive
returned
to
Washington
in
midmorning
from
Hyannis_Port
,
Mass.
,
a
White_House
spokesman
said
the
address
text
still
had
``
quite
a
way_to_go
''
toward
completion
.
Asked
to
elaborate
,
Pierre_Salinger
,
White_House
press
secretary
,
replied
,
``
I
would
say
it
's
got
to
go
thru
several
more
drafts
''
.
Salinger
said
the
work
President_Kennedy
,
advisers
,
and
members
of
his
staff
were
doing
on
the
address
involved
composition
and
wording
,
rather_than
last
minute
decisions
on
administration
plans
to
meet
the
latest
Berlin
crisis
precipitated
by
Russia
's
demands
and
proposals
for
the
city
.
The
last
10
cases
in
the
investigation
of
the
Nov
.8
election
were
dismissed
yesterday
by
Acting_Judge_John_M._Karns
,
who
charged
that
the
prosecution
obtained
evidence
``
by
unfair
and
fundamentally
illegal
means
''
.
Karns
said
that
the
cases
involved
a
matter
``
of
even
greater
significance
than
the
guilt
or
innocence
''
of
the
50
persons
.
He
said
evidence
was
obtained
``
in
violation
of
the
legal_rights
of
citizens
''
.
Karns
'
ruling
pertained
to
eight
of
the
10
cases
.
In
the
two
other
cases
he
ruled
that
the
state
had
been
``
unable
to
make
a
case
''
.
Contempt
proceedings
originally
had
been
brought
against
677
persons
in
133
precincts
by
Morris_J._Wexler
,
special
prosecutor
.
Wexler
admitted
in
earlier
court
hearings
that
he
issued
grand_jury
subpenas
to
about
200
persons
involved
in
the
election
investigation
,
questioned
the
individuals
in
the
Criminal_courts
building
,
but
did
not
take
them
before
the
grand_jury
.
Mayer_Goldberg
,
attorney
for
election
judges
in
the
58
th
precinct
of
the
23
d
ward
,
argued
this
procedure
constituted
intimidation
.
Wexler
has
denied
repeatedly
that
coercion
was
used
in
questioning
.
Karns
said
it
was
a
``
wrongful
act
''
for
Wexler
to
take
statements
``
privately
and
outside
of
the
grand_jury
room
''
.
He
said
this
constituted
a
``
very
serious
misuse
''
of
the
Criminal_court
processes
.
``
Actually
,
the
abuse
of
the
process
may
have
constituted
a
contempt
of
the
Criminal_court
of
Cook
county
,
altho
vindication
of
the
authority
of_that
court
is
not
the
function
of_this
court
''
,
said
Karns
,
who
is
a
City
judge
in
East
St._Louis
sitting
in
Cook_County
court
.
Karns
had
been
scheduled
this
week
to
hear
seven
cases
involving
35
persons
.
Wexler
had
charged
the
precinct
judges
in
these
cases
with
``
complementary
''
miscount
of
the
vote
,
in_which
votes
would
be
taken
from
one
candidate
and
given
to
another
.
The
cases
involved
judges
in
the
33
d
,
24
th
,
and
42
d
precincts
of
the
31
st
ward
,
the
21
st
and
28
th
precincts
of
the
29
th
ward
,
the
18
th
precinct
of
the
4
th
ward
,
and
the
9
th
precinct
of
the
23
d
ward
.
The
case
of
the
judges
in
the
58
th
precinct
of
the
23
d
ward
had
been
heard
previously
and
taken
under
advisement
by
Karns
.
Two
other
cases
also
were
under
advisement
.
After
reading
his
statement
discharging
the
23
d
ward
case
,
Karns
told
Wexler
that
if
the
seven
cases
scheduled
for
trial
also
involved
persons
who
had
been
subpoenaed
,
he
would
dismiss
them
.
President_Kennedy
today
proposed
a
mammoth
new
medical_care
program
whereby
social_security
taxes
on
70
million
American
workers
would
be
raised
to
pay
the
hospital
and
some
other
medical_bills
of
14.2
million
Americans
over
65
who
are
covered
by
social_security
or
railroad
retirement
programs
.
The
President
,
in
a
special
message
to
Congress
,
tied_in
with
his
aged
care
plan
requests
for
large
federal
grants
to
finance
medical
and
dental
scholarships
,
build
20
new
medical
and
20
new
dental_schools
,
and
expand
child
health_care
and
general
medical
research
.
The
aged
care
plan
,
similar
to
one
the
President
sponsored
last
year
as
a
senator
,
a
fight
on
Capitol_hill
.
It
was
defeated
in
Congress
last
year
.
It
would
be
financed
by
boosting
the
social_security
payroll
tax
by
as
much_as
$
37
a
year
for
each
of
the
workers
now
paying
such
taxes
.
The
social_security
payroll
tax
is
now
6
per_cent
-
3
per_cent
on
each
worker
and
employer
-
on
the
first
$
4800
of
pay
per_year
.
The
Kennedy
plan
alone
would
boost
the
base
to
$
5000
a
year
and
the
payroll
tax
to
6.5
per_cent
-
3.25
per_cent
each
.
Similar
payroll
tax_boosts
would
be
imposed
on
those
under
the
railroad
retirement
system
.
The
payroll
tax
would
actually
rise
to
7.5
per_cent
starting
Jan.
1
,
1963
,
if
the
plan
is
approved
,
because
the
levy
is
already
scheduled
to
go_up
by
1
per_cent
on_that
date
to
pay
for
other
social_security
costs
.
Officials
estimated
the
annual
tax_boost
for
the
medical
plan
would
amount
to
1.5
billion
dollars
and
that
medical
benefits
paid_out
would
run
1
billion
or
more
in
the
first
year
,
1963
.
Both
figures
would
go
higher
in
later
years
.
Other
parts
of
the
Kennedy
health
plan
would
entail
federal
grants
of
750
million
to
1
billion
dollars
over
the
next
10
years
.
These
would
be
paid
for
out
of
general
,
not
payroll
,
taxes
.
The
aged
care
plan
carries
these
benefits
for
persons
over
65
who
are
under
the
social_security
and
railroad
retirement
systems
:
Full
payment
of
hospital
bills
for
stays
up
to
90
days
for
each
illness
,
except
that
the
patient
would
pay
$
10
a
day
of
the
cost
for
the
first
nine
days
.
Full
payment
of
nursing_home
bills
for
up_to
180
days
following
discharge
from
a
hospital
.
A
patient
could
receive
up_to
300
days
paid-for
nursing_home
care
under
a
``
unit
formula
''
allowing
more
of
such
care
for
those
who
use
none
or
only
part
of
the
hospital-care
credit
.
Hospital
outpatient
clinic
diagnostic
service
for
all
costs
in_excess
of
$
20
a
patient
.
Community
visiting_nurse
services
at_home
for
up_to
240
days
an
illness
.
The
President
noted
that
Congress
last
year
passed
a
law
providing
grants
to
states
to
help
pay
medical_bills
of
the
needy
aged
.
He
said
his
plan
is
designed
to
``
meet
the
needs
of
those
millions
who
have
no
wish
to
receive
care
at
the
taxpayers
'
expense
,
but
who
are
nevertheless
staggered
by
the
drain
on
their
savings
-
or
those
of
their
children
-
caused
by
an
extended
hospital
stay
''
.
``
This
is
a
very
modest
proposal
cut
to
meet
absolutely
essential
needs
''
,
he
said
,
``
and
with
sufficient
'
deductible
'
requirements
to
discourage
any
malingering
or
unnecessary
overcrowding
of
our
hospitals
.
``
This
is
not
a
program
of
socialized
medicine
.
It
is
a
program
of
prepayment
of
health
costs
with
absolute
freedom
of
choice
guaranteed
.
Every
person
will
choose
his
own
doctor
and
hospital
''
.
The
plan
does
not
cover
doctor
bills
.
They
would
still
be
paid
by
the
patient
.
Apart
from
the
aged
care
plan
the
President
's
most
ambitious
and
costly
proposals
were
for
federal
scholarships
,
and
grants
to
build
or
enlarge
medical
and
dental_schools
.
The
President
said
the
nation
's
92
medical
and
47
dental_schools
cannot
now
handle
the
student
load
needed
to
meet
the
rising
need
for
health_care
.
Moreover
,
he
said
,
many
qualified
young
people
are
not
going
into
medicine
and
dentistry
because
they
can
n't
afford
the
schooling
costs
.
The
scholarship
plan
would
provide
federal
contributions
to
each
medical
and
dental_school
equal_to
$
1500
a
year
for
one-fourth
of
the
first
year
students
.
The
schools
could
use
the
money
to
pay
4
-
year
scholarships
,
based
on
need
,
of
up_to
$
2000
a
year
per
student
.
In_addition
,
the
government
would
pay
a
$
1000
``
cost
of
education
''
grant
to
the
schools
for
each
$
1500
in
scholarship
grants
.
Officials
estimated
the
combined
programs
would
cost
5.1
million
dollars
the
first
year
and
would
go_up
to
21
millions
by
1966
.
The
President
recommended
federal
``
matching
grants
''
totaling
700
million
dollars
in
10
years
for
constructing
new
medical
and
dental_schools
or
enlarging
the
capacity
of
existing
ones
.
In
the
area
of
``
community
health
services
''
,
the
President
called_for
doubling
the
present
10
million
dollar
a
year
federal
grants
for
nursing_home
construction
.
He
asked
for
another
10
million
dollar
``
initial
''
appropriation
for
``
stimulatory
grants
''
to
states
to
improve
nursing_homes
.
He
further
proposed
grants
of
an
unspecified
sum
for
experimental
hospitals
.
In
the
child
health
field
,
the
President
said
he
will
recommend
later
an
increase
in
funds
for
programs
under
the
children
's
bureau
.
He
also
asked
Congress
to
approve
establishment
of
a
national
child
health
institute
.
The
President
said
he
will
ask
Congress
to
increase
grants
to
states
for
vocational
rehabilitation
.
He
did
not
say
by
how
much
.
For
medical
research
he
asked
a
20
million
dollar
a
year
increase
,
from
30
to
50
millions
,
in
matching
grants
for
building
research
facilities
.
The
President
said
he
will
also
propose
increasing
,
by
an
unspecified
amount
,
the
540
million
dollars
in
the
1961
-
62
budget
for
direct
government
research
in
medicine
.
The
President
said
his
proposals
combine
the
``
indispensable
elements
in
a
sound
health
program
-
people
,
knowledge
,
services
,
facilities
,
and
the
means
to
pay
for
them
''
.
Congressional
reaction
to
the
message
was
along
expected
lines
.
Legislators
who
last
year
opposed
placing
aged-care
under
the
social_security
system
criticized
the
President
's
plan
.
Those
who
backed
a
similar
plan
last
year
hailed
the
message
.
Senate_Republican_Leader_Dirksen
[
Ill
.
]
and
House_Republican_Leader_Charles_Halleck
[
Ind
.
]
said
the
message
did
not
persuade
them
to
change
their
opposition
to
compulsory
medical
insurance
.
Halleck
said
the
voluntary
care
plan
enacted
last
year
should
be
given
a
fair
trial
first
.
House_Speaker_Sam_Rayburn
[
D.
,
Tex
.
]
called
the
Kennedy
program
``
a
mighty
fine
thing
''
,
but
made
no
prediction
on
its
fate
in
the
House
.
Acting
hastily
under
White_House
pressure
,
the
Senate
tonight
confirmed
Robert_C._Weaver
as
the
nation
's
federal
housing
chief
.
Only
11
senators
were
on
the
floor
and
there
was
no
record
vote
.
A_number_of
scattered
``
ayes
''
and
``
noes
''
was
heard
.
Customary_Senate
rules
were
ignored
in_order_to
speed
approval
of
the
Negro
leader
as
administrator
of
the
housing
and
home
finance
agency
.
In
the
last
eight
years
,
all
Presidential
appointments
,
including
those
of
cabinet
rank
,
have
been
denied
immediate
action
because
of
a
Senate
rule
requiring
at_least
a
24
hour
delay
after
they
are
reported
to
the
floor
.
The
rule
was
enforced
by
demand
of
Sen._Wayne_Morse
[
D.
,
Ore
.
]
in
connection
with
President_Eisenhower
's
cabinet
selections
in
1953
and
President_Kennedy
's
in
1961
.
