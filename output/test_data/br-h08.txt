of
the
Civil_War
,
this
fact
is
being
commemorated
with
several
exhibits
throughout
the
State
,
but
most_of_all
paying
tribute
to
the
first
Rhode_Island
Volunteers
who
rushed

the
defense
of
the
City
of
Washington
,
putting
at
the
disposal
of
President_Lincoln
the
only
fully
equipped
and
best

do

The
year
1961
marks
the
fourteenth
anniversary
of
the
unification
of
our
Armed_Forces
under
the
National_Security_Act
of
1947
.
National
defense
,
like
the
continuing
search
for
peace
with
freedom
and
justice
for
all
,
is
``
everybody
's
business
''
.
Our
investment
in_this
effort
,
the
greatest
in
our
Nation
's
history
,
reflects
our
determination
to
ensure
the
peace
and
the
future
of
freedom
.
It
is
a
sound
investment
.
As
the
President
has
said
,
``
only
when
our
arms
are
sufficient
beyond_doubt
can
we
be
certain
that
they
will
never
be
employed
''
.
Armed_Forces
Day
is
the
annual
report
on
this
investment
,
a
public_presentation
designed
to
give
our
own
people
,
and
the
people
of
other
lands
who
stand
with
us
for
peace
with
freedom
and
justice
,
the
best
possible
opportunity
to
see
and
understand
what
we
have
and
why
we
have
it
.
It
is
the
purpose
of
Armed_Forces
Day
to
give
Americans
an
opportunity
to
honor
men
of
the
Armed_Forces
,
those
who
have
made
the
supreme
sacrifice
,
those
who
remain
to
preserve
our
security
.
Freedom
depends_upon
them
;
Now
,
therefore
,
do
i
,
John_A._Notte

our
precious
liberty
.
In

I

The

The

The
ballet
originated_in
Italy
about
1450
.
At_that_time
it
was
a
series
of
sophisticated
social
dances
whose
steps
were
often
combined
with
other
steps
devised
by
the
choreographer
.
Ballet
flowered
in
Italy
during
the
next
hundred
years
,
and
about
1550
was
carried
to
France
when
the
Italian
princess
,
Catherine
de
Medicis
,
married
the
King
of
France
.
The_most
famous
ballet
of_that
time
was
called
Ballet_Comique
de
la
Reine
(
1581
)
.
Dances
alternated
with
sung
or
spoken
verses
.
Ballets
were
used
in
opera
from
its
beginning
.
They
were
placed
either
in_the_middle
of
the
acts
or
in
the
intermissions
.
The
State_Ballet
of
Rhode_Island
,
the
first
incorporated
group
,
was
formed
for_the_purpose_of
extending
knowledge
of
the
art
of
ballet
in
the
Community
,
to
promote
interest
in
ballet
performances
,
to
contribute
to
the
cultural
life
of
the
State
,
and
to
provide
opportunity
for
gifted
dance
students
who
,
for
one
reason
or
another
,
are
unable
to
pursue
a
career
and
to
develop
others
for
the
professional
state
;
And
now
,
therefore
,
do
I
,
John_A._Notte
,
Jr.
,
Governor
of
the
State
of
Rhode_Island
and
Providence

proclaim
the
week

as
the
State_Ballet

Rhode_Island
Week

requesting
all
Rhode_Islanders
to
give
special
attention
to
this
unusual
event
which
should
contribute
to
the
cultural
life
of
the
State
.
In
testimony
whereof

I
have
hereunto
set

As
another
Thanksgiving
draws_near
,
let
us
take
time_out
from
the
often
hectic
pace
of
our
lives
to
try
and
recapture
the
feelings
that
filled
the
hearts
of
the
Pilgrims
on
the
first
Thanksgiving
.
The
Pilgrims
gathered
to
thank
the
Lord
for
His
benevolence
during
their
first
year
in
the
new
land
.
They
had
been
through
trying
times
,
but
their
faith
in
the
Almighty
had
given
them
the
courage
and
the
strength
to
meet
and
overcome
the
many
problems
and
difficulties
that
were
the
price
they
had
to
pay
for
freedom
.
And
as
the
Pilgrims
bowed
their
heads
in
humble
gratitude
,
they
shared
another
feeling
-
the
anticipation
of_what
the
future
held
for
them
and
their
posterity
.
They
could
not
guess
that
from
their
concepts
of
liberty
and
freedom
would
some_day
be_born
a
new
nation
that
for
years
would
be
the
symbol
of
hope
to
the
oppressed
countries
of
the
world
.
They
simply
turned_to
God
filled
with
gratitude
and
faith
.
We
who
are
living
today
may
learn
a
valuable
lesson
from
those
who
celebrated
the
first
Thanksgiving_Day
.
The
Lord
has
shown
time_and_time_again
His
love
for
us
.
We
have
only
to
compare
the
liberty
and
high
standard_of_living
we
enjoy
in_this
great
country
with
the
oppression
and
frugality
of
other
nations
to
realize
with
humble
gratitude
that
God
's
Providence
has
been
with
us
since
the
very
beginning
of
our
country
.
And
yet
,
accompanying
our
gratitude
is
the
realization
that
we
are
living
in
a
crucial
time
.
With
world
peace
constantly
being
threatened
,
most_of
us
regard
the
future
skeptically
,
and
even
with
fear
.
It
is
at
this
time
that
we
should
imitate
the
Pilgrims
by
accompanying
our
prayers
of
thanks
with
the
conviction
that
we
shall
continue
to
be
in
dire
need
for
the
Lord
's
protection
in_the_future
,
if
we
are
to
have
peace
;
Now
,
therefore
,
do
I
,
John_A._Notte
,
Jr.
,
Governor
of
the
State
of
Rhode_Island
and
Providence
Plantations
,
proclaim
Thursday
,
November
23
rd
,
1961
,
as
Thanksgiving_Day
,
And
so
,
let
us
remember
on_this_day
not_only
to
thank
the
Almighty
Who
gave
hope
and
courage
to
the
Pilgrims
,
but
also
to
place
our
trust
in
Him
that
He
will
continue
to
protect
us
in_the_future
as
He
has
in_the_past
.
In
testimony
whereof
,
I
have
hereunto
set
my
hand
and
caused
the
seal
of
the
State
to
be
affixed
this
21
