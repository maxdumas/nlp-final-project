An
out-of-town
writer
came_up_to
Paul_Richards
today
and
asked
the
Oriole
manager
if
he
thought
his
ball_club
would
be
improved
this
year
.
Now
Richards
,
of_course
,
is
known
as
a
deep
thinker
as
baseball
managers
go
.
He
can
often
make
the
complex
ridiculously
simple
,
and
vice_versa
.
This
happened
to
be
vice_versa
,
but
even_so
,
the
answer
was
a
masterpiece
.
``
It
's
a
whole
lot
easier
''
,
he
said
,
``
to
increase
the
population
of
Nevada
,
than
it
is
to
increase
the
population
of
New_York_city
''
.
And
with_that
he
walked
off
to
give
instruction
to
a
rookie
pitcher
.
``
That
is
undoubtedly
a
hell
of
a
quote
''
,
said
the
writer
,
scratching
his
head
.
``
Now
,
if
I
can
just
figure_out
what
he
's
talking_about
,
I
'll
use
it
''
.
This
was
just
Richard
's
way
of
saying
that
last
year
the_Birds
opened
spring_training
with
a_lot_of
jobs
wide_open
.
Some
brilliant
rookies
nailed
them
down
,
so_that
this
spring
just
two
spots
,
left
and
right
field
,
are
really
up
for
grabs
.
It
should
be
easier
to
plug
two
spots
than
it
was
to
fill
the
wholesale
lots
that
were
open
last
year
,
but
so_far
it
has
n't
worked
that
way
.
This
angle
of
just
where
the
Orioles
can
look_for
improvement
this
year
is
an
interesting
one
.
You
'd
never
guess
it
from
the
way
they
've
played
so_far
this
spring
,
but
there
remains
a
feeling
among
some
around
here
that
the
Orioles
still
have
a
chance
to
battle
for
the
pennant
in
1961
.
Obviously
,
if
this
club
is
going_to
move
from
second
to
first
in
the
American_League
,
it
will
have
to
show
improvement
someplace
.
Where
can
that
improvement
possibly
come
from
?
You
certainly
can
n't
expect
the
infield
to
do
any
better
than
it
did
last
year
.
Brooks_Robinson
is
great
,
and
it
is
conceivable
that
he
'll
do
even
better
in
1961
than
he
did
in
1960
.
You
can
n't
expect
it
,
though
.
Robby
's
performance
last
year
was
tremendous
.
It
's
the
same
with
Ron_Hansen
and
jim
Gentile
.
If
they
do
as_well
as
they
did
in
1960
there
can
be
no
complaint
.
They
should
n't
be
asked
to
carry
any_more
of
the
burden
.
Hansen
will
be
getting
a
late
spring_training
start
,
which
might
very_well
set
him
back
.
He
got_off
to
an
exceptional
start
last
season
,
and
under_the_circumstances
probably
won
n't
duplicate
it
.
There
are
some
clubs
which
claim
they
learned
something
about
pitching
to
him
last
year
.
They
do
n't
expect
to
stop
him
,
just
slow
him
down
some
with
the
bat
.
He
'll
still
be
a
top
player
,
they
concede
,
because
he
's
got
a
great
glove
and
the
long
ball
going_for
him
.
But
they
expect
to
reduce
his
over-all
offensive
production
.
Gentile
can
hardly
do
better
than
drive_in
98
runs
.
Do
n't
ask
him
more
.
I
have
a
hunch
Marv_Breeding
might
move_up
a
notch
.
But
even_so
,
he
had
a
good
year
in
1960
and
won
n't
do
too_much
better
.
So
,
all_in_all
,
the
infield
can
n't
be
expected
to
supply
the
added
improvement
to
propel
the_Birds
from
second
to
first
.
And
the
pitching
will
also
have
trouble
doing
better
.
Richards
got
a
great
performance
out
of
his
combination
of
youth
and
experience
last
season
.
Where
,
then
,
can
we
look_for
improvement
?
``
From
Triandos
,
Brandt
and
Walker
''
,
answers
Richards
.
``
They
're
the
ones
we
can
expect
to
do
better
''
.
The
man
is
right
,
and
at
this
time
,
indications
are
that
these
three
are
ready
for
better
seasons
.
Triandos
has
n't
proved
it
yet
,
but
he
says
he
's
convinced
his
thumb
is
all_right
.
He
jammed
it
this
spring
and
has
had
to
rest
it
,
but
he
says
the
old
injury
has
n't
bothered
him
.
If
he
can
bounce_back
with
one
of
those
25
home_runs
years
,
the
club
will
have
to
be
better
off
offensively
.
I
'm
still
not
convinced
,
though
,
I
'll
have
to
see
more
of
him
before
predicting
that
big
year
for
him
.
Hank_Foiles
,
backed_up
by
Frank_House
who
will
be
within
calling
distance
in
the
minors
,
make_up
better
second
line
catching
than
the_Birds
had
all
last
year
,
but
Gus
is
still
that
big
man
you
need
when
you
start
talking
pennant
.
To
me
,
Brandt
looks
as
though
he
could
be
in_for
a
fine
year
.
He
has
n't
played
too_much
,
because
Richards
has
been
working_on
him
furiously
in
batting
practice
.
He
's
hitting
the
ball
hard
,
in
the
batting_cage
,
and
his
whole
attitude
is
improved
over
this
time
last
year
.
When
he
came
to
Baltimore
,
he
was
leaving
a
team
which
was
supposed
to
win
the
National_League
pennant
,
and
he
was
joining
what
seemed
to
be
a
second
division
American_League
club
.
He
was
down
,
hard
to
talk
to
,
and
far
too
nonchalant
on
the
field
.
As
of
now
,
that
all
seems
behind
him
.
He
's
been
entirely
different
all
spring
.
And
Walker
looks
stronger
,
seems
to
be
throwing
better
than
he
did
last
year
.
Let
him
bounce_back
,
and
he
could
really
set_up
the
staff
.
So
,
if
the
Orioles
are
to
improve
,
Brandt
,
Triandos
and
Walker
will
have
to
do
it
.
So_far
the
platoons
on
left
and
right_fielders
do
n't
seem
capable_of
carrying
the
load
.
Of_course
,
this
is
n't
taking
into
consideration
the
population
of
Nevada
and
New_York_city
,
but
it
's
the
way
things
look
from
here
at
this
point
.
Is
the
mother
of
an
``
autistic
''
child
at_fault
?
(
The
``
autistic
''
child
is
one
who
seems
to
lack
a
well-defined
sense
of
self
.
He
tends
to
treat
himself
and
other
people
as
if
they
were
objects
-
and
sometimes
he
treats
objects
as
if
they
were
people
.
)
Did
his
mother
make
him
this
way
?
Some
people
believe
she
did
.
We
think
differently
.
We
believe
that
autism
,
like
so
many
other
conditions
of
defect
and
deviation
,
is
to
a
large
extent
inborn
.
A
mother
can
help
a
child
adapt
to
his
difficulties
.
Sometimes
she
can
-
to
a
large
extent
-
help
him
overcome
them
.
But
we
do
n't
think
she
creates
them
.
We
do
n't
think
she
can
make
her
child
defective
,
emotionally
disturbed
or
autistic
.
The
mother
of
a
difficult
child
can
do
a
great_deal
to
help
her
own
child
and
often
,
by
sharing
her
experiences
,
she
can
help
other
mothers
with
the
same
problem
.
Since
little
is
known
about
autism
,
and
almost
nothing
has
been
written
for
the
layman
,
we
'd
like
to
share
one
experienced
mother
's
comments
.
She
wrote
:
``
As
the
mother
of
an
autistic
child
who
is
lacking
in
interest
and
enthusiasm
about
almost
anything
,
I
have
to
manipulate
my
son
's
fingers
for
him
when
he
first
plays
with
a
new
toy
.
He
wants
me
to
do
everything
for
him
.
``
You
do
n't
believe
that
autistic
children
become
autistic
because
of
something
that
happens
to
them
or
because
of
the
way
their
mother
treats
them
.
But
I
do
and
my
psychiatrist
does
,
too
.
I
know
,
that
my
son
wants
control
and
direction
,
but
being
autistic
myself
I
cannot
give
full
control
or
direction
.
``
One
thing
I
notice
which
I
have
seldom
heard
mentioned
.
This
is
that
autistic
people
do
n't
enjoy
physical
contact
with
others
-
for_instance
,
my
children
and
I
.
When
I
hold
my
son
he
stiffens
his
whole
body
in
my
arms
until
he
is
as
straight
and
stiff
as
a
board
.
He
pushes
and
straightens
himself
as
if
he
can
n't
stand
the
feeling
of
being
held
.
Physical
contact
is
uncomforatble
for
him
''
!
This
mother
is
quite
correct
.
As
a
rule
,
the
autistic
child
does
n't
enjoy
physical
contact
with
others
.
Parents
have
to
find
other
ways
of
comforting
him
.
For
the
young
child
this
may
be
no_more_than
providing
food
,
light
or
movement
.
As
he
grows
older
it
may
be
a
matter
of
providing
some
accustomed
object
(
his
``
magic
''
thing
)
.
Or
certain
words
or
rituals
that
child
and
adult
go_through
may
do
the
trick
.
The
answer
is
different
for
each
autistic
child
,
but
for
most
there
is
an
answer
.
Only
ingenuity
will
uncover
it
.
``
Dear
Doctors
:
We
learned
this
year
that
our
older
son
,
Daniel
,
is
autistic
.
We
did
not
accept
the
diagnosis
at_once
,
but
gradually
we
are
coming_to
.
Fortunately
,
there
is
a
nursery_school
which
he
has
been
able
to
attend
,
with
a
group
of
normal
children
.
``
I
try
to
treat
Daniel
as
if
he
were
normal
,
though
of_course
I
realize
he
is
far
from_that
at_present
.
What
I
do
is
to
try
to
bring
him
into
contact
with
reality
as_much_as_possible
.
I
try
to
give
him
as_many
normal
experiences
as
possible
.
``
What
is
your
experience
with
autistic
children
?
How
do
they
turn_out
later
''
?
Many
autistic
children
grow_up
to
lead
relatively
normal
lives
.
Certainly
,
most
continue
to
lack
a
certain
warmth
in
communication
with
other
people
,
but
many
adjust
to
school
,
even
college
,
to
jobs
and
even
to
marriage
and
parenthood
.
A
first
grader
colors
pictures
one
solid
color
,
everything
-
sky
,
grass
,
boy
,
wagon
,
etc.
.
When
different
colors
are
used
,
she
is
just_as
likely
to
color
trees
purple
,
hair
green
,
etc.
.
The
other
children
in
the
class
use
this
same
coloring_book
and
do
a
fairly
good
job
with
things
their
proper
color
.
Should
I
show
my
daughter
how
things
should
be
colored
?
She
is
an
aggressive
,
nervous
child
.
Is
a
relaxed
home
atmosphere
enough
to
help
her
outgrow
these
traits
?
Her
choice
of
one
color
means
she
is
simply
enjoying
the
motor
act
of
coloring
,
without
having
reached
the
point
of
selecting
suitable
colors
for
different
objects
.
This
immature
use
of
crayons
may
suggest
that
she
is
a_little
immature
for
the
first_grade
.
No
,
coloring
is
n't
exactly
something
you
teach
a
child
.
You
sometimes
give
them
a_little
demonstration
,
a_little
guidance
,
and
suggestions
about
staying
inside
the
lines
.
But
most
learn
to
color
and
paint
as
and
when
they
are
ready
with
only
a
very
little
demonstration
.
Seen
in
decorating
circles
of_late
is
a
renewed
interest
in
an
old
art
:
embroidery
.
Possibly
responsible_for
this
is
the
incoming
trend
toward
multicolor
schemes
in
rooms
,
which
seems
slated
to
replace
the
one-color
look
to
which
we
have
been
accustomed
.
Just_as
a
varitinted
Oriental
rug
may
suggest
the
starting_point
for
a
room
scheme
,
so
may
some
of
the
newest
versions
of
embroidery
.
One
such
,
in_fact
,
is
a
rug
.
Though
not
actually
crewel
embroidery
,
it
has
that
look
with
its
over-stitched
raised
pattern
in
blue
,
pink
,
bronze
and
gold
and
a
sauterne
background
.
The
twirled
,
stylized
design
of
winding
stems
and
floral
forms
strongly
suggests
the
embroidered
patterns
used
so
extensively
for
upholstery
during
the
Jacobean
period
in
England
.
Traditional
crewel
embroidery
which
seems
to
be
appearing
more_frequently
this
fall
than
in_the_past
few
years
is
still
available
in_this
country
.
The
work
is
executed
in
England
(
by_hand
)
and
can
be
worked
in
any
desired
design
and
color
.
Among
some
recent
imports
were
seat
covers
for
one
series
of
dining_room
chairs
on_which
were
depicted
salad_plates
overflowing_with
tomatoes
and
greens
and
another
set
on
which
a
pineapple
was
worked
in
naturalistic
color
.
For
a
particularly
fabulous
room
which
houses
a
collection
of
fine
English_Chippendale
furniture
,
fabric
wall
panels
were
embroidered
with
a
typically
Chinese-inspired
design
of_this
revered
Eighteenth_Century
period
.
Since
the
work
is
done
by_hand
,
the
only
limitation
,
it
is
said
,
``
is
that
of
human
conception
''
.
Modern
embroidered
panels
,
framed
and
meant
to
be
hung
on
the
wall
,
are
another
aspect
of_this
trend
.
These
have
never
gone_out
of
style
in
Scandinavian
homes
and
now
seem
to
be
reappearing
here_and_there
in
shops
which
specialize
in
handicrafts
.
An
amateur
decorator
might
try_her_hand_at
a
pair
during
the
long
winter
evenings
,
and
,
by
picking_up
her
living_room
color_scheme
,
add
a
decorative
do-it-yourself
note
to
the
room
.
