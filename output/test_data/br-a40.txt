Into
Washington
on
President-elect_John_F._Kennedy
's
Convair
,
the
Caroline
,
winged
Actor-Crooner_Frank_Sinatra
and
his
close
Hollywood
pal
,
Cinemactor_Peter_Lawford
,
Jack_Kennedy
's
brother-in-law
.
Also
included
in
the
entourage
:
a
dog
in
a
black
sweater
,
Frankie
and
Peter
had
an
urgent
mission
:
to
stage
a
mammoth
Inauguration_Eve
entertainment
gala
in
the
capital
's
National_Guard
Armory
.
Frankie
was
fairly
glutted
with
ideas
,
as
he
had
hinted
upon
his
arrival
:
``
It
's
really
tremendous
when
you
think
Ella_Fitzgerald
is
coming
from
Australia
.
I
could
talk
to
you
for
three
hours
and
still
not
be
able
to
give
you
all_of
our
plans
''
!
As
the
plans
were
laid
,
some
several
thousand
fat
cats
were
to
be
ensconced
in
the
armory
's
$
100
seats
and
in
68
ringside
boxes
priced
at
$
10000
each
.
The
biggest
single
act
would
doubtless
be
staged
by
Frankie
himself
:
his
Inaugural
wardrobe
had
been
designed
by
Hollywood_Couturier_Don_Loper
,
who
regularly
makes_up
ladies
'
ensembles
.
Soon
after
Loper
leaked
the
news
that
Frankie
had
ordered
``
two
of
everything
''
just
``
in_case
he
spills
anything
''
,
Frankie
got
so
mad
at
the
chic
designer
that
he
vowed
he
would
not
wear
a
stitch
of
Loper
clothing
.
A
year
after
he
was
catapulted
over
nine
officers
senior
to
him
and
made
commandant
of
the
Marine_Corps
,
General_David_M._Shoup
delivered
a
peppery
annual
report
in
the
form
of
a
``
happy
,
warless
New_Year
''
greeting
to
his
Pentagon
staff
.
Said
Leatherneck_Shoup
:
``
A
year
ago
I
took
the
grips
of
the
plow
in
my
hands
.
After
pushing
an
accumulation
of
vines
and
weeds
from
the
moldboard
,
I
lifted
the
lines
from
the
dust
and
found
hitched
to_that
plow
the
finest
team
I
ever
held
a
rein
on
.
Little
geeing
and
hawing
have
been
necessary
''
.
But
Shoup
also
gave
the
Corps
a
tilling
in_spots
.
Speaking
of
``
pride
''
,
he
deplored
the
noncommissioned_officer
``
whose
uniform
looks_like
it
belonged_to
someone
who
retired
in
1940
;
the
officer
with
the
yellow
socks
or
the
bay_window
.
A_few
of
these
people
are
still
around

G._David_Thompson
is
one
of
those
names
known
to
the
stewards
of
transatlantic
jetliners
and
to
doormen
in
Europe
's
best
hotels
,
but
he
is
somewhat
of
an
enigma
to
most
people
in
his
own
home
town
of
Pittsburgh
.
There
the
name
vaguely
connotes
new-rich
wealth
,
a
reputation
for
eccentricity
,
and
an
ardor
for
collecting
art
.
Last
week
,
in
the
German
city
of
Du
^
sseldorf
,
G._David_Thompson
was
making
headlines
that
could
well
give
Pittsburgh
pause
.
On
display
were
343
first-class
paintings
and
sculptures
from
his
fabled
collection
-
and
every
single
one
of
them
was
up
for_sale
.
Like
Philadelphia
's
late
Dr._Albert_C._Barnes
who
kept
his
own
great
collection
closed
to
the
general
public
(
Time
,
Jan.
2
)
,
Thompson
,
at
61
,
is
something
of
a
legend
in
his
own
lifetime
.
He
made
his
fortune
during
World_War
2
,
when
he
took_over
a_number_of
dying
steel
plants
and
kept
them
alive
until
the
boom
.
Even
before
he
hit
big
money
,
he
had
begun
buying
modern
paintings
.
He
gave
the
impression
of
never
having
read
a
word
about
art
,
but
there
was
no_doubt
that
he
had
an
eye
for
the
best
.
He
was
able
to
smell
a
bargain
-
and
a
masterpiece
-
a
continent
away
,
and
the
Museum
of
Modern_Art
's
Alfred_Barr
said
of
him
:
``
I
have
never
mentioned
a
new
artist
that
Thompson
did
n't
know
about
''
.
He
might
barge
into
a
gallery
,
start
haggling
over
prices
without
so_much
as
a
word
of
greeting
.
He
could
be
lavishly
generous
with
friends
,
cab
drivers
and
bellboys
,
but
with
dealers
he
was
tough
.
He
bought_up
Cezannes
,
Braques
,
Matisses
,
Legers
,
a
splendid
Picasso
series
,
more_than
70
Giacometti
sculptures
.
He
gathered
one
of
the
biggest
collections
of
Paul_Klees
in
the
world
.
All
these
he
hung
in
his
burglarproof
home
called
Stone
's_Throw
,
outside
Pittsburgh
,
and
only
people
he
liked
and
trusted
ever
got_to
see
them
.
Two
years
ago
Thompson
offered
his
collection
to
the
city
.
But
he
insisted
that
it
be
housed
in
a
special
museum
.
Pittsburgh
turned
him
down
,
just_as
Pittsburgh
society
had
been
snubbing
him
for
years
.
He
went
then
to
a
40
-
year-old
Basel
art_dealer
named
Ernst_Beyeler
,
with
whom
he
had
long
been
trading
pictures
.
Last
year
Beyeler
arranged
to
sell
$
1500000
worth
of
Klees
to
the
state
of
North_Rhine-Westphalia
,
which
will
house
them
in
a
museum
that
is
yet
to
be
built
.
Last
week
most_of
the
other
prizes
,
once
offered
to
Pittsburgh
,
went
on
the
block
.
At
the
opening
of
the
Du
^
sseldorf
show
,
Thompson
himself
scarcely
glanced
at
the
treasures
that
he
was
seeing
together
for
the
last
time
.
In_fact
he
seemed
delighted
to
get_rid_of
them
.
Some
observers
speculated
that
this
might
be
his
revenge
on
his
home
town
.
Thompson
himself
said
:
``
I
want
to
enjoy
once_more
the
pleasure
of
bare
walls
waiting
for
new
pictures
''
.
The
University
of
Georgia
has
long
claimed
that
it
does
not
discriminate
against
any
applicant
on
the
basis
of
race
or
color
.
But
in_all
its
175
years
,
not
a
single
Negro
student
has
entered
its
classrooms
.
Last
week
Federal_District
Judge_William_A._Bootle
ordered
the
university
to
admit
immediately
a
``
qualified
''
Negro
boy
and
girl
.
Their
entry
will
crack
the
total
segregation
of
all
public
education
,
from
kindergarten
through
graduate_school
,
in
Georgia
-
and
in
Alabama
,
Mississippi
and
South_Carolina
as_well
.
For
18
months
,
Hamilton_Holmes
,
19
,
and
Charlayne_Hunter
,
18
,
had
tried
to
get_into
the
university
.
They
graduated
together
from
Atlanta
's
Turner
High_School
,
where
Valedictorian_Holmes
was
first
in
the
class
and
Charlayne
third
.
The
university
rejected
them
on
a
variety
of
pretexts
,
but
was
careful
never
to
mention
the
color
of
their
skins
.
Holmes
went_to
Atlanta
's
Morehouse
(
Negro
)
College
,
where
he
is
a
B
+
student
and
star
halfback
.
Charlayne
studied
journalism
at
Detroit
's
Wayne_State_University
.
Last
fall
,
after
they
took
their
hopes
for
entering
Georgia
to
court
,
Judge_Bootle
ordered
them
to
apply
again
.
Charlayne
was
``
tentatively
''
admitted
for
next
fall
,
after
state
investigators
questioned
her
white
roommate
at
Wayne_State
.
But
Holmes
was
rejected
again
``
on
the
basis
of
his
record
and
interview
''
.
The
evidence
in
court
was
testimony
about
the
interview
,
which
for
Holmes
lasted
an
hour
,
although
at_least
one
white
student
at
Georgia
got_through
this
ritual
by
a
simple
phone
conversation
.
Holmes
was
asked
if
he
had
ever
visited
a
house_of_prostitution
,
or
a
``
beatnik
parlor
or
teahouse
''
.
No
,
said
he
,
but
officials
still
called
him
``
evasive
''
.
They
also
said
he
lied
in
saying
that
he
had
never
been
``
arrested
''
.
Their
reason
:
Holmes
once
paid
a
$
20
speeding
fine
,
had
his
license
suspended
.
Negro
lawyers
dug_into
the
records
of
300
white
students
,
found
that
many
were
hardly
interviewed
at_all
-
and
few
had
academic
records
as_good_as
Hamilton_Holmes
.
The
real
reason
for
his
rejection
,
they
argued
,
is
the
fact
that
Georgia
law
automatically
cuts_off
funds
for
any
desegregated
school
.
Judge_Bootle
's
decision
:
``
The
two
plaintiffs
are
qualified
for
admission
to
said
university
and
would
already
have
been
admitted
had
it
not
been
for
their
race
and
color
''
.
The
state
will
appeal
-
but
few
think
it
will
actually
try
to
close
the
university
.
``
Surprised
and
pleased
''
,
Students
Holmes
and
Hunter
may
enter
the
University
of
Georgia
this
week
.
When
the
University
of
Chicago
's
Chancellor_Lawrence_A._Kimpton
submitted
his
resignation
last
March
,
a
mighty
talent
hunt
gripped
the
Midway
.
Out
went
letters
to
60000
old
grads
,
asking
for
suggestions
.
Such
academic
statesmen
as
James_B._Conant
were
consulted
.
Two
committees
pondered
375
possible
Kimpton
successors
,
including
Adlai_Stevenson
,
Richard_Nixon
,
and
Harvard
's
Dean_McGeorge_Bundy
.
The
debate
led
to
a
decision
that
Chicago
needed
neither
a
big
name
nor
an
experienced
academic_administrator
,
but
rather
,
as
Trustee_Chairman_Glen_A._Lloyd
put
it
,
``
a
top
scholar
in
his
own
right
''
-
a
bright
light
to
lure
other
top
scholars
to
Chicago
.
Last
week
Chicago
happily
found
its
top
scholar
in
Caltech
's
acting
dean
of
the
faculty
:
dynamic
Geneticist_George_Wells_Beadle
,
57
,
who
shared
the
1958
Nobel_Prize
in
medicine
and
physiology
for
discovering
how
genes
affect
heredity
by
controlling
cell
chemistry
(
Time
,
Cover
,
July_14
,
1958
)
.
It
fell
to
Chancellor_Kimpton
,
now
a
Standard_Oil
(
Indiana
)
executive
,
to
spend
his
nine-year
reign
tidying_up
Chicago
after
the
21
-
year
typhoon
of
Idealist
Robert_Maynard_Hutchins
.
He
threw_out
some
of
Hutchins
'
more
wildly
experimental
courses
,
raised
sagging
undergraduate
enrollment
to
2100
,
nearly
doubled
endowment
to
$
139.3
million
.
But
though
Kimpton
put
Chicago
in_what
he
felt
was
working
order
,
some
old
grads
feel
that
it
still
needs
the
kind_of
lively
teachers
who
filled
it
in
the
heady
Hutchins
era
.
At
Caltech
,
Geneticist_Beadle
has
stuck
close_to
his
research
as
head
of
the
school
's
famous
biology
division
since
1946
.
But
he
has
shown
a
sixth-sense
ability
to
spot
,
recruit
and
excite
able
researchers
,
and
has
developed
unexpected
talents
in
fund
raising
and
speech-making
.
Beadle
is
even
that
rare
scientist
who
takes
an
interest
in
money
matters
;
he
avidly
reads
the
Wall_Street
Journal
,
and
took
delight
in
driving
a
$
250
model
A
Ford
for
22
years
,
then
selling
it
for
$
300
.
