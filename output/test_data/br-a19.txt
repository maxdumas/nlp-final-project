The
Baltimore
and
Ohio_Railroad
announced
yesterday
it
would
reduce
the
total
amount
of
its
payroll
by
10
per_cent
through
salary
cuts
and
lay-offs
effective
at
12.01
A._M.
next
Saturday
.
The
current
monthly
payroll
comes
to
about
$
15000000
.
Howard_E._Simpson
,
the
railroad
's
president
,
said
,
``
A
drastic
decline
in
freight
loading
due
principally
to
the
severe
slump
in
the
movement
of
heavy
goods
has
necessitated
this
regrettable
action
''
.
The
reduction
in
expenses
will
affect
employees
in
the
thirteen
states
in_which
the
B.
+
O.
operates
.
It
will
be
accomplished
in_two_ways
:
A
flat
reduction
of
10
per_cent
in
the
salary
of
all
officers
,
supervisors
and
other
employees
not
belonging_to
unions
.
There
are
about
3325
officers
and
employees
in_this
class
.
Sufficient
lay-offs
of
union
employees
to
bring_about
a
10
per_cent
cut
in
the
union
payroll
expense
.
Since
the
railroad
cannot
reduce
the
salary
of
individual
union_members
under
contract
,
it
must
accomplish
its
payroll
reduction
by
placing
some
of
the
men
on
furlough
,
a
B.
+
O.
spokesman
said
.
Those
union_members
kept
on
their
jobs
,
therefore
,
will
not
take
a
cut
in
their
wages
.
The
spokesman
said
the
number
to
be
furloughed
cannot
be
estimated
since
the
lay-offs
must
be
carried_out
in
each
area
depending_on
what
men
are
most
needed
on_the_job
.
A
thug
struck
a
cab
driver
in
the
face
with
a
pistol
last
night
after
robbing
him
of
$
18
at
Franklin
and
Mount
streets
.
The
victim
,
Norman_B._Wiley
,
38
,
of
the
900
block
North_Charles
street
,
was
treated
for
cuts
at
Franklin_Square_Hospital
after
the
robbery
.
The
driver
told
police
he
followed
as
the
Negro
man
got_out
of
the
cab
with
his
money
.
The
victim
was
beaten
when
he
attempted
to
stop
the
bandit
.
He
said
the
assailant
,
who
was
armed
with
a
.45
-
caliber
automatic
,
entered
the
taxi
at
Pennsylvania
avenue
and
Gold
street
.
In
another
attack
,
Samuel_Verstandig
,
41
,
proprietor
of
a
food
store
in
the
2100
block
Aiken
street
,
told
police
two
Negroes
assaulted
him
in
his
store
and
stole
$
150
from
the
cash_register
after
choking
and
beating
him
.
A
baby
was
burned
to
death
and
two
other
children
were
seriously
injured
last
night
in
a
fire
which
damaged
their
one-room
Anne_Arundel
county
home
.
The
victim
Darnell_Somerville
,
Negro
,
1
,
was
pronounced
dead
on
arrival
at
Anne_Arundel_General_Hospital
in
Annapolis
.
His
sister
and
brother
,
Marie_Louise
,
3
,
and
John_Raymond
,
Jr.
22
months
,
were
admitted
to
the
hospital
.
The
girl
was
in
critical
condition
with
burns
over
90
per_cent
of
her
body
.
The
boy
received
second-degree_burns
of
the
face
,
neck
and
back
.
His
condition
was
reported
to
be
fair
.
Police
said
the
children
's
mother
,
Mrs._Eleanor_Somerville
,
was
visiting
next_door
when
the
fire
occurred
.
The
house
is
on
Old_Annapolis
road
a
mile
south
of
Severna_Park
,
at
Jones_Station
,
police
said
.
The
Anne_Arundel
county
school_superintendent
has
asked
that
the
Board_of_Education
return
to
the
practice
of
recording
its
proceedings
mechanically
so_that
there
will
be
no_more
question
about
who
said
what
.
The
proposal
was
made
by
Dr._David_S._Jenkins
after
he
and
Mrs._D._Ellwood_Williams
,
Jr.
,
a
board_member
and
long-time
critic
of
the
superintendent
,
argued
for
about
fifteen
minutes
at
this
week
's
meeting
.
The
disagreement
was
over
what
Dr._Jenkins
had
said
at
a
previous
session
and_how
his
remarks
appeared
in
the
minutes
presented
at
the
following
meeting
.
Mrs._Williams
had
a
list
which
she
said
contained
about
nine
or
ten
discrepancies
between
her
memory
of
Dr._Jenkins
's
conversation
and_how
they
were
written
up
for
the
board
's
approval
.
``
I
hate
to
have
these
things
come_up
again_and_again
''
,
Dr._Jenkins
commented
as
he
made
his
suggestion
.
``
These
are
the
board
's
minutes
.
I
'll
write
what
you
tell
me
to
''
.
For
a_number_of
years
the
board
used
a
machine
to
keep
a
permanent
record
but
abandoned
the
practice
about
two
years
ago
.
It
was
about
that
time
,
a
board_member
said
later
,
that
Dr._Thomas_G._Pullen
,
Jr.
,
State
superintendent
of
schools
,
told
Dr._Jenkins
and
a_number_of
other
education
officials
that
he
would
not
talk
to
them
with
a
recording_machine
sitting
in_front
of
him
.
The
Board
of
County
Commissioners
,
the
Sanitary_Commission
,
the
Planning
and
Zoning_Board
and
other
county
official
bodies
use
recording_machines
for
all
public
business
in_order_to
prevent
law
suits
and
other
misunderstandings
about
what
actually
happened
at
their
meetings
.
Dr._Jenkins
notes
,
however
,
that
most_of
the
school_boards
in
the
State
do
not
do
so
.
State_Senator
Joseph_A._Bertorelli
(
D.
,
First_Baltimore
)
had
a
stroke
yesterday
while
in
his
automobile
in
the
200
block
of
West_Pratt
street
.
He
was
taken
to
University_Hospital
in
a
municipal
ambulance
.
Doctors
at
the
hospital
said
he
was
partially
paralyzed
on_the_right
side
.
His
condition
was
said
to
be
,
``
fair
''
.
Police
said
he
became
ill
while
parked
in_front
of
a
barber
shop
at
229
West_Pratt
street
.
He
called
Vincent_L._Piraro
,
proprietor
of
the
shop
,
who
summoned
police
and
an
ambulance
.
The
vice_president
of
the
City_Council
complained
yesterday
that
there
are
``
deficiencies
''
in
the
city
's
snow
clearing
program
which
should
be
corrected
as
soon
as
possible
.
Councilman_William_D._Schaefer
(
D.
,
Fifth
)
said
in
a
letter
to
Mayor_Grady
that
plowing
and
salting
crews
should
be
dispatched
earlier
in
storms
and
should
be
kept
on
the
job
longer
than
they
were
last
month
.
Conceding
that
several
cities
to_the_north
were
in
worse
shape
than
Baltimore
after
the
last
storm
,
Mr._Schaefer
listed
several
improvements
he
said
should
be
made
in
the
snow
plan
here
.
He
said
the
snow
plan
was
put
in
effect
too
slowly
in
December
.
Equipment
should
be
in_operation
``
almost
immediately
after
the
first
snowfall
''
,
Mr._Schaefer
said
.
The
Councilman
,
who
is
the
Administration
floor_leader
,
also
criticized
Bernard_L._Werner
,
public_works
director
,
for
``
halting
snow
operations
''
on
Tuesday
night
after
the
Sunday
storm
.
Mr._Werner
said
yesterday
that
operations
continued
through
the
week
.
What
he
did
,
Mr._Werner
said
,
was
let
manual_laborers
go_home
Tuesday
night
for
some
rest
.
Work
resumed
Wednesday
,
he
said
.
Mr._Schaefer
also
recommended
that
the
snow
emergency
route
plan
,
under
which
parking
is
banned
on
key
streets
and
cars
are
required
to
use
snow_tires
or
chains
on
them
,
should
be
``
strictly
enforced
''
.
Admitting
that
main_streets
and
the
central
business_district
should
have
priority
,
the
Councilman
said
it
is
also
essential
that
small
shopping
areas
``
not
be
overlooked
if
our
small
merchants
are
to
survive
''
.
Recounting
personal
observations
of
clearance
work
,
the
Councilman
cited
instances
of
inefficient
use
of
equipment
or
supplies
by
poorly
trained
workers
and
urged
that
plow
blades
be
set
so
they
do
not
leave
behind
a
thin
layer
of
snow
which
eventually
freezes
.
The
15
-
year-old
adopted
son
of
a
Washington
attorney
and
his
wife
,
who
were
murdered
early
today
in
their
Chesapeake
Bay-front
home
,
has
been
sent
to
Spring_Grove_State_Hospital
for
detention
.
The
victims
were
H._Malone_Dresbach
,
47
,
and
his
wife
,
Shirley
,
46
.
Each
had
been
shot
in_the_back
several_times
with
a
.22
-
caliber
automatic_rifle
,
according
to
Capt._Elmer_Hagner
,
chief
of
Anne_Arundel
detectives
.
Judge_Benjamin_Michaelson
signed
the
order
remanding
the
boy
to
the
hospital
because
of
the
lack
of
juvenile
accommodations
at
the
Anne_Arundel_County_Jail
.
The
Circuit_Court
jurist
said
the
boy
will
have
a
hearing
in
Juvenile_Court
.
Soon
after
10
A._M.
,
when
police
reached
the
1
-
1
2
-
story
brick
home
in
the
Franklin_Manor
section
,
15
miles
south
of
here
on
the
bay
,
in
response
to
a
call
from
the
Dresbach
's
other
son
,
Lee
,
14
,
they
found
Mrs._Dresbach
's
body
on
the
first-floor
bedroom
floor
.
Her
husband
was
lying
on
the
kitchen
floor
,
police
said
.
The
younger
son
told
police
his
brother
had
run
from
the
house
after
the
shootings
and
had
driven
away
in
their
mother
's
car
.
The
description
of
the
car
was
immediately
broadcast
throughout
Southern_Maryland
on
police
radio
.
Police
said
the
boys
are
natural
brothers
and
were
adopted
as
small
children
by
the
Dresbachs
.
Trooper_J._A._Grzesiak
spotted
the
wanted
car
,
with
three
boys
,
at
a
Route
2
service_station
,
just
outside
Annapolis
.
The
driver
admitted
he
was
the
Dresbachs
'
son
and
all
three
were
taken
to
the
Edgewater_Station
,
police
said
.
Governor_Tawes
today
appointed
Lloyd_L._Simpkins
,
his
administrative
assistant
,
as
Maryland
's
Secretary_of_State
.
Mr._Simpkins
will
move_into
the
post
being
vacated
by
Thomas_B._Finan
,
earlier
named
attorney_general
to
succeed
C._Ferdinand_Sybert
,
who
will
be
elevated
to
an
associate
judgeship
on
the
Maryland
Court_of_Appeals
.
Governor_Tawes
announced
that
a
triple
swearing-in
ceremony
will
be
held
in
his
office
next
Friday
.
Mr._Simpkins
is
a
resident
of
Somerset
county
,
and
he
and
the
Governor
,
also
a
Somerset
countian
,
have
been
friends
since
Mr._Simpkins
was
a
child
.
Now
38
,
Mr._Simpkins
was
graduated
from
the
University
of
Maryland
's
College
of
Agriculture
in
1947
.
Five
years
later
,
he
was
awarded
the
university
's
degree
in
law
.
Mr._Simpkins
made
a
name
for
himself
as
a
member
of
the
House
of
Delegates
from
1951
through
1958
.
From
the
outset
of
his
first
term
,
he
established
himself
as
one
of
the
guiding
spirits
of
the
House
of
Delegates
.
Maryland
contracts
for
future
construction
during
October
totaled

Dodge
reported
the
following
breakdown
:
Nonresidential
at

,
up
100
per_cent
;
and
heavy

at
$
9841000
,
down
45
per_cent
.
The
cumulative
total
of
construction
contracts
for
the
first
ten
months
of
1961
amounted
to
$
634517000
,
a
4
per_cent
increase
compared
to
the
corresponding
period
of
last

Residential
building
consists_of
houses
,
apartments
,
hotels
,
dormitories
and
other
buildings
designed
for
shelter
.
The
share
of
the
new
housing
market
enjoyed
by
apartments
,
which
began
about
six
years
ago
,
has
more_than
tripled
within
that
span
of
time
.
In
1961
,
it
is
estimated
that
multiple
unit
dwellings
will
account_for
nearly
30
per_cent
of
the
starts
in
residential
construction
.
While
availability
of
mortgage
money
has
been
a
factor
in
encouraging
apartment
construction
,
the
generally
high
level
of
prosperity
in_the_past
few
years
plus
rising
consumer
income
are
among
the
factors
that
have
encouraged
builders
to
concentrate
in
the
apartment-building
field
.
Although
economic
and
personal
circumstances
vary
widely
among
those
now
choosing
apartments
,
Leo_J._Pantas
,
vice_president
of
a
hardware
manufacturing
company
,
pointed_out
recently
that
many
apartment
seekers
seem
to
have
one
characteristic
in
common
:
a
desire
for
greater
convenience
and
freedom
from
the
problems
involved
in
maintaining
a
house
.
``
Convenience
is
therefore
the
key
to
the
housing
market
today
.
Trouble-free
,
long-life
,
quality
components
will
play
an
increasingly
important
part
in
the
merchandising
of
new
housing
in
1960
''
,
Pantas
predicted
.
Sixty-seven
living
units
are
being
added
to
the
165
-
unit
Harbor_View_Apartments
in
the
Cherry_Hill
section
.
Ultimately
the
development
will
comprise
300
units
,
in
two-story
and
three-story
structures
.
Various
of
the
apartments
are
of
the
terrace
type
,
being
on
the
ground_floor
so_that
entrance
is
direct
.
Others
,
which
are
reached
by
walking
up
a
single
flight_of_stairs
,
have
balconies
.
The
structures
housing
the
apartments
are
of
masonry
and
frame
construction
.
Heating
is
by
individual
gas-fired
,
forced
warm
air
systems
.
Construction
in
1962
will
account_for
about
15
per_cent
of
the
gross_national_product
,
according
to
a
study
by
Johns-Manville_Corporation
.
