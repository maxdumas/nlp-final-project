The
thermal
exchange
of
chlorine
between
*
*
f
and
liquid
*
*
f
is
readily
measurable
at
temperatures
in
the
range
of
180
`
and
above
.
The
photochemical_exchange
occurs
with
a
quantum
yield
of
the
order
of
unity
in
the
liquid
phase
at
65
`
using
light
absorbed
only
by
the
*
*
f
.
In
the
gas
phase
,
with
*
*
f
of
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
of
*
*
f
,
quantum
yields
of
the
order
of
*
*
f
have
been
observed
at
85
`
.
Despite
extensive
attempts
to
obtain
highly
pure
reagents
,
serious
difficulty
was
experienced
in
obtaining
reproducible
rates
of
reaction
.
It
appears
possible
to
set
a
lower_limit
of
about
*
*
f
for
the
activation_energy
of
the
abstraction
of
a
chlorine
atom
from
a
carbon_tetrachloride
molecule
by
a
chlorine
atom
to
form
*
*
f
radical
.
The
rate
of
the
gas
phase
exchange
reaction
appears
to
be
proportional
to
the
first
power
of
the
absorbed
light
intensity
indicating
that
the
radical
intermediates
are
removed
at
the
walls
or
by
reaction
with
an
impurity
rather
than
by
bimolecular
radical
combination
reactions
.
Because
of
the
simplicity
of
the
molecules
,
isotopic
exchange
reactions
between
elemental
halogens
and
the
corresponding
carbon_tetrahalides
would
appear
to
offer
particularly
fruitful
possibilities
for
obtaining
unambiguous
basic
kinetic
data
.
It
would
appear
that
it
should
be
possible
to
determine
unique
mechanisms
for
the
thermal
and
photochemical_reactions
in
both
the
liquid
and
gas
phases
and
to
determine
values
for
activation_energies
of
some
of
the
intermediate
reactions
of
atoms
and
free_radicals
,
as_well_as
information
on
the
heat_of_dissociation
of
the
carbon
halogen
bond
.
The
reaction
of
chlorine
with
carbon_tetrachloride
seemed
particularly
suited
for
such
studies
.
It
should
be
possible
to
prepare
very
pure
chlorine
by
oxidation
of
inorganic
chlorides
on
a
vacuum
system
followed
by
multiple
distillation
of
the
liquid
.
It
should
be
possible
to
free
carbon_tetrachloride
of
any
interfering
substances
by
the
usual
purification
methods
followed
by
prechlorination
prior
to
addition
of
radioactive
chlorine
.
Furthermore
,
the
exchange
would
not
be
expected
to
be
sensitive
to
trace
amounts
of
impurities
because
it
would
not
be
apt
to
be
a
chain_reaction
since
the
activation_energy
for
abstraction
of
chlorine
by
a
chlorine
atom
would
be
expected
to
be
too
high
;
also
it
would
be
expected
that
*
*
f
would
compete
very
effectively
with
any
impurities
as
a
scavenger
for
*
*
f
radicals
.
Contrary
to
these
expectations
we
have
found
it
impossible
to
obtain
the
degree
of
reproducibility
one
would
wish
,
even
with
extensive
efforts
to
prepare
especially
pure
reagents
.
We
are
reporting
these
investigations
here
briefly
because
of
their
relevancy
to
problems
of
the
study
of
apparently
simple
exchange
reactions
of
chlorine
and
because
the
results
furnish
some
information
on
the
activation_energy
for
abstraction
of
chlorine
atoms
from
carbon_tetrachloride
.
Matheson
highest
purity
tank
chlorine
was
passed
through
a
tube
of
resublimed
*
*
f
into
an
evacuated
Pyrex
system
where
it
was
condensed
with
liquid_air
.
It
was
then
distilled
at_least
three
times
from
a
trap
at_-
78
`
to
a
liquid_air
trap
with
only
a
small
middle
fraction
being
retained
in
each
distillation
.
The
purified
product
was
stored
at_-
78
`
in
a
tube
equipped
with
a
break_seal
.
Of
several
methods
employed
for
tagging
chlorine
with
radiochlorine
,
the
exchange
of
inactive
chlorine
with
tagged
aluminum_chloride
at
room_temperature
was
found
to
be
the
most
satisfactory
.
To
prepare
the
latter
,
silver_chloride
was
precipitated
from
a
solution
containing
*
*
f
obtained
from
the
Oak_Ridge_National_Laboratory
.
The
silver_chloride
was
fused
under
vacuum
in
the
presence
of
aluminum
chips
with
the
resultant
product
of
*
*
f
which
was
sublimed
into
a
flask
on
the
vacuum
line
.
Previously
purified
chlorine
was
subsequently
admitted
and
the
exchange
was
allowed
to
take_place
.
The
radiochlorine
was
stored
at_-
78
`
in
a
tube
equipped
with
a
break_seal
.
Liter
quantities
of
Mallinckrodt
,
low
sulfur
,
reagent
grade
carbon_tetrachloride
were
saturated
with
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
and
illuminated
for
about
50
hours
with
a
1000
watt
tungsten
lamp
at
a
distance
of
a_few
inches
.
The
mixture
was
then
extracted
with
alkali
and
with
water
following
which
the
carbon_tetrachloride
was
distilled
on
a
Vigreux
column
,
a
25
%
center
cut
being
retained
which
was
then
degassed
under
vacuum
in
the
presence
of
*
*
f
.
Purified
inactive
chlorine
was
then
added
from
one
of
the
tubes
described
above
and
the
mixture
frozen_out
and
sealed_off
in
a
flask
equipped
with
a
break_seal
.
This
chlorine
carbon_tetrachloride
solution
was
illuminated
for
a
day
following
which
the
flask
was
resealed
onto
a
vacuum
system
and
the
excess
chlorine
distilled
off
.
The
required
amount
of
carbon_tetrachloride
was
distilled
into
a
series
of
reaction
cells
on
a
manifold
on
a
vacuum
line
.
The
desired
amounts
of
inactive
chlorine
and
radioactive
chlorine
were
likewise
condensed
in
these
cells
on
the
vacuum
line
following
which
they
were
frozen_down
and
the
manifold
as_a_whole
was
sealed_off
.
The
contents
of
the
manifold
for
liquid
phase
experiments
were
then
mixed
by
shaking
,
redistributed
to
the
reaction
tubes
,
frozen_down
,
and
each
tube
was
then
sealed_off
.
The
reactants
for
the
gas
phase
experiments
were
first
frozen_out
in
a
side
arm
attached
to
the
manifold
and
then
allowed
to
distill
slowly
into
the
manifold
of
pre-cooled
reaction
cells
before
sealing_off
.
This
method
in_general
solved
the
problem
of
obtaining
fairly
equal
concentrations
of
reactants
in
each
of
the
six
cells
from
a
set
.
The
samples
for
liquid
phase
thermal
reaction
studies
were
prepared
in
Pyrex
capillary_tubing
2.5
mm.
i.d.
and
about
15
cm.
long
.
In
a_few
experiments
the
tubes
were
made
from
standard
6
mm.
i.d.
Pyrex
tubing
of
1
mm.
wall
thickness
.
Both
types
of
tube
withstood
the
pressure
of
approximately
20
atmospheres
exerted
by
the
carbon_tetrachloride
at
220
`
.
The
photochemical_reaction
cells
consisted_of
10
mm.
i.d.
Pyrex
tubing
,
5.5
cm.
long
,
diffraction
effects
being
minimized
by
the
fact
that
the
light
passed_through
only
liquid
glass
interfaces
and
not
gas
glass
interfaces
.
These
cells
were
used
rather
than
square
Pyrex
tubing
because
of
the
tendency
of
the
latter
to
shatter
when
thawing
frozen
carbon_tetrachloride
.
The
round
cells
were
reproducibly
positioned
in
the
light_beam
which
entered
the
thermostated
mineral_oil
bath
through
a
window
.
Two
types
of
light
source
were
used
,
a
thousand
watt
projection
lamp
and
an
AH6
high
pressure
mercury
arc
.
The
light
was
filtered
by
the
soft_glass
window
of
the
thermostat
thus
ensuring
that
only
light
absorbed
by
the
chlorine
and
not
by
the
carbon_tetrachloride
could
enter
the
reaction
cell
.
Relative
incident
light
intensities
were
measured
with
a
thermopile
potentiometer
system
.
Changes
of
intensity
on
the
cell
were
achieved
by
use
of
a
wire
screen
and
by
varying
the
distance
of
the
light
source
from
the
cell
.
Following
reaction
the
cells
were
scratched
with
a
file
and
opened
under
a
20
%
aqueous
sodium_iodide
solution
.
Carrier
*
*
f
was
added
and
the
aqueous
and
organic
phases
were
separated
(
cells
containing
gaseous
reactants
were
immersed
in
liquid_air
before
opening
under
sodium_iodide
)
.
After
titration
of
the
liberated
*
*
f
with
*
*
f
,
aliquots
of
the
aqueous
and
of
the
organic
phase
were
counted
in
a
solution
type
Geiger_tube
.
In
the
liquid
phase
runs
the
amount
of
carbon_tetrachloride
in
each
reaction
tube
was
determined
by
weighing
the
tube
before
opening
and
weighing
the
fragments
after
emptying
.
The
fraction
of
exchange
was
determined
as
the
ratio
of
the
counts
/
minute
observed
in
the
carbon_tetrachloride
to
the
counts
/
minute
calculated
for
the
carbon_tetrachloride
fractions
for
equilibrium
distribution
of
the
activity
between
the
chlorine
and
carbon_tetrachloride
,
empirically
determined
correction
being
made
for
the
difference
in
counting
efficiency
of
*
*
f
in
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
.
In
studying
the
liquid
phase
thermal
reaction
,
some
70
tubes
from
12
different
manifold
fillings
were
prepared
and
analyzed
.
Experiments
were
done
at
180
,
200
,
210
,
220
`
.
Following
observation
of
the
fact
that
the
reaction
rates
of
supposedly
identical
reaction
mixtures
prepared
on
the
same
filling
manifold
and
exposed
under
identical
conditions
often
differed
by
several
hundred
per_cent
,
a
systematic
series
of
experiments
was
undertaken
to
see
whether
the
difficulty
could
be
ascribed
to
the
method
of
preparing
the
chlorine
,
to
the
effects
of
oxygen
or
moisture
or
to
the
effect
of
surface
to
volume
ratio
in
the
reaction
tubes
.
In_addition
to
the
method
described
in
the
section
above
,
chlorine
and
radiochlorine
were
prepared
by
the
electrolysis
of
a
*
*
f
eutectic
on
the
vacuum
line
,
and
by
exchange
of
*
*
f
with
molten
*
*
f
.
Calcium_hydride
was
substituted
for
*
*
f
as
a
drying_agent
for
carbon_tetrachloride
.
No
correlation
between
these
variables
and
the
irreproducibility
of
the
results
was
found
.
The
reaction
rates
observed
at
200
`
ranged
from
*
*
f
of
the
chlorine
exchanged
per
hour
to
0.7
exchanged
per
hour
.
In
most
cases
the
chlorine
concentration
was
about
*
*
f
.
Sets
of
reaction
tubes
containing
0.2
of
an
atmosphere
of
added
oxygen
in
one
case
and
added
moisture
in
another
,
both
gave
reaction
rates
in
the
range
of
0.1
to
0.4
of
the
chlorine
exchanged
per
hour
.
No
detectable
reaction
was
found
at
room_temperature
for
reaction
mixtures
allowed
to
stand
up_to
5
hours
.
The
liquid
phase
photochemical_exchange
between
chlorine
and
carbon_tetrachloride
was
more
reproducible
than
the
thermal
exchange
,
although
still
erratic
.
The
improvement
was
most
noticeable
in
the
greater
consistency
among
reaction
cells
prepared
as_a_group
on
the
same
manifold
.
Rather
large
differences
were
still
found
between
reaction
cells
from
different
manifold
fillings
.
Some
80
reaction
tubes
from
13
manifold
fillings
were
illuminated
in
the
temperature
range
from
40
to
85
`
in
a
further
endeavor
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
irreproducibility
and
to
obtain
information
on
the
activation_energy
and
the
effect
of
light
intensity
.
In
all
cases
there
was
readily
measurable
exchange
after
as
little
as
one
hour
of
illumination
.
By
comparing
reaction
cells
sealed
from
the
same
manifold
temperature
dependency
corresponding
to
activation_energies
ranging
from
11
to
18
*
*
f
was
observed
while
dependence
on
the
first
power
of
the
light
intensity
seemed
to
be
indicated
in
most
cases
.
It
was
possible
to
make
estimates
of
the
quantum
yield
by
observing
the
extent
of
reduction
of
a
uranyl_oxalate
actinometer
solution
illuminated
for
a
known
time
in
a
typical
reaction
cell
and
making
appropriate
conversions
based
on
the
differences
in
the
absorption_spectra
of
uranyl_oxalate
and
of
chlorine
,
and
considering
the
spectral
distribution
of
the
light
source
.
These
estimates
indicated
that
the
quantum
yield
for
the
exchange
of
chlorine
with
liquid
carbon_tetrachloride
at
65
`
is
of
the
order_of_magnitude
of
unity
.
When
typical
reaction
cells
to
which
0.3
of
an
atmosphere
of
oxygen
had
been
added
were
illuminated
,
chlorine
and
phosgene
were
produced
.
Exchange
was
also
observed
in
these
cells
,
which
had
chlorine
present
at
*
*
f
.
Although
there
was
some
variation
in
results
which
must
be
attributed
either
to
trace
impurities
or
to
variation
in
wall
effects
,
the
photochemical_exchange
in
the
gas
phase
was
sufficiently
reproducible
so
that
it
seemed
meaningful
to
compare
the
reaction
rates
in
different
series
of
reaction
tubes
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
information
on
the
effect
of
chlorine
concentration
and
of
carbon_tetrachloride
concentration
on
the
reaction
rate
.
Data
on
such
comparisons
together
with
data
on
the
effect
of
light
intensity
are
given
in
Table
/1
.
.
In
series
/1
,
the
relative
light
intensity
was
varied
by
varying
the
distance
of
the
lamp
from
the
reaction
cell
over
the
range
from
14.7
to
29.2
cm.
.
The
last
column
shows
the
rate
of
exchange
that
would
have
been
observed
at
a
relative
intensity
of
4
(
14.7
cm.
distance
)
calculated
on
the
assumptions
that
the
incident
light
intensity
is
inversely
proportional
to
the
square
of
the
distance
of
the
lamp
from
the
cell
and
that
the
rate
is
directly
proportional
to
the
incident
light
intensity
.
Direct
proportionality
of
the
rate
to
the
incident
intensity
has
also
been
assumed
in
obtaining
the
value
in
the
last
column
for
the
fourth
sample
of
series
/2
,
where
the
light
intensity
was
reduced
by
use
of
a
screen
.
