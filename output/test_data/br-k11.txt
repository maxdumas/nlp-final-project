Standing
in
the
shelter
of
the
tent
-
a
rejected
hospital
tent
on
which
the
rain
now
dripped
,
no_longer
drumming
-
Adam
watched
his
own
hands
touch
the
objects
on
the
improvised
counter
of
boards
laid
across
two
beef
barrels
.
There
was
,
of_course
,
no
real
need
to
rearrange
everything
.
A
quarter
inch
this
way
or
that
for
the
hardbake
,
or
the
toffee
,
or
the
barley
sugar
,
or
the
sardines
,
or
the
bitters
,
or
the
condensed_milk
,
or
the
stationery
,
or
the
needles
-
what
could
it
mean
?
Adam
watched
his
own
hands
make
the
caressing
,
anxious
movement
that
,
when
rain
falls
and
nobody
comes
,
and
ruin
draws_close
like
a
cat
rubbing
against
the
ankles
,
has
been
the
ritual
of
stall
vendors
,
forever
.
He
recognized
the
gesture
.
He
knew
its
meaning
.
He
had
seen
a
dry
,
old
,
yellowing
hand
reach_out
,
with
that
painful
solicitude
,
to
touch
,
to
rearrange
,
to
shift
aimlessly
,
some
object
worth
a
pfennig
.
Back
in
Bavaria
he
had
seen
that
gesture
,
and
at
that
sight
his
heart
had
always
died
within
him
.
On
such
occasions
he
had
not
had
the
courage
to
look
at
the
face
above
the
hand
,
whatever
face
it
might
be
.
Now
the
face
was
his
own
.
He
wondered
what
expression
,
as
he
made
that
gesture
,
was
on
his
face
.
He
wondered
if
it
wore
the
old
anxiety
,
or
the
old
,
taut
stoicism
.
But
there
was
no
need
,
he
remembered
,
for
his
hand
to
reach_out
,
for
his
face
to
show
concern
or
stoicism
.
It
was
nothing
to
him
if
rain
fell
and
nobody
came
.
Then
why
was
he
assuming
the
role
-
the
gesture
and
the
suffering
?
What
was
he
expiating
?
Or
was
he
now
taking
the
role
-
the
gesture
and
the
suffering
-
because
it
was
the
only
way
to
affirm
his
history
and
identity
in
the
torpid
,
befogged
loneliness
of
this
land
.
This
was
Virginia
.
He
looked_out
of
the
tent
at
the
company
street
.
The
rain
dripped
on
the
freezing
loblolly
of
the
street
.
Beyond
that
misty
gray
of
the
rain
,
he
saw
the
stretching
hutment
,
low
diminutive
log_cabins
,
chinked
with
mud
,
with
doorways
a
man
would
have_to
crouch
to
get
through
,
with
roofs
of
tenting
laid_over
boughs
or
boards
from
hardtack
boxes
,
or
fence_rails
,
with
cranky
chimneys
of
sticks
and
dried
mud
.
The
chimney
of
the
hut
across
from
him
was
surmounted
by
a
beef
barrel
with
ends
knocked_out
.
In
this
heavy
air
,
however
,
that
device
did
not
seem
to
help
.
The
smoke
from
that
chimney
rose
as
sluggishly
as
smoke
from
any
other
,
and
hung
as
sadly
in
the
drizzle
,
creeping
back_down
along
the
sopping
canvas
of
the
roof
.
Over
the
door
was
a
board
with
large
,
inept
lettering
:
Home_Sweet_Home
.
This
was
the
hut
of
Simms_Purdew
,
the
hero
.
The
men
were
huddled
in
those
lairs
.
Adam
knew
the
names
of
some
.
He
knew
the
faces
of
all
,
hairy
or
shaven
,
old
or
young
,
fat
or
thin
,
suffering
or
hardened
,
sad
or
gay
,
good
or
bad
.
When
they
stood
about
his
tent
,
chaffing
each
other
,
exchanging
their
obscenities
,
cursing
command
or
weather
,
he
had
studied
their
faces
.
He
had
had
the
need
to
understand
what
life
lurked
behind
the
mask
of
flesh
,
behind
the
oath
,
the
banter
,
the
sadness
.
Once
covertly
looking
at
Simms_Purdew
,
the
only
man
in
the
world
whom
he
hated
,
he
had
seen
the
heavy
,
slack
,
bestubbled
jaw
open
and
close
to
emit
the
cruel
,
obscene
banter
,
and
had
seen
the
pale
blue
eyes
go
watery
with
whisky
and
merriment
,
and
suddenly
he
was
not
seeing
the
face
of
that
vile
creature
.
He
was
seeing
,
somehow
,
the
face
of
a
young
boy
,
the
boy
Simms_Purdew
must
once
have
been
,
a
boy
with
sorrel
hair
,
and
blue
eyes
dancing
with
gaiety
,
and
the
boy
mouth
grinning
trustfully
among
the
freckles
.
In
that
moment
of
vision
Adam
heard
the
voice
within
himself
saying
:
I
must
not
hate
him
,
I
must
not
hate
him
or
I
shall
die
.
His
heart
suddenly
opened
to
joy
.
He
thought
that
if
once
,
only
once
,
he
could
talk
with
Simms_Purdew
,
something
about
his
own
life
,
and
all
life
,
would
be
clear
and
simple
.
If
Simms_Purdew
would
turn_to
him
and
say
:
``
Adam
,
you
know
when
I
was
a
boy
,
it
was
a
funny
thing
happened
.
Lemme
tell
you
now
''
-
If
only
Simms_Purdew
could
do
that
,
whatever
the
thing
he
remembered
and
told
.
It
would
be
a
sign
for
the
untellable
,
and
he
,
Adam
,
would
understand
.
Now
,
Adam
,
in
the
gray
light
of
afternoon
,
stared
across
at
the
hut
opposite
his
tent
,
and
thought_of
Simms_Purdew
lying
in
there
in
the
gloom
,
snoring
on
his
bunk
,
with
the
fumes
of
whisky
choking
the
air
.
He
saw
the
sign
above
the
door
of
the
hut
:
Home_Sweet_Home
.
He
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
in
a
poncho
coming
up
the
company
street
,
with
an
armful
of
wood
.
It
was
Pullen_James
,
the
campmate
of
Simms_Purdew
.
He
carried
the
wood
,
carried
the
water
,
did
the
cooking
,
cleaning
and
mending
,
and
occasionally
got
a
kick_in_the_butt
for
his
pains
.
Adam
watched
the
moisture
flow
from
the
poncho
.
It
gave
the
rubberized
fabric
a
dull
gleam
,
like
metal
.
Pullen_James
humbly
lowered
his
head
,
pushed_aside
the
hardtack
box
door
of
the
hut
,
and
was
gone
from
sight
.
Adam
stared
at
the
door
and
remembered
that
Simms_Purdew
had
been
awarded
the
Medal_of_Honor
for
gallantry
at
Antietam
.
The
street
was
again
empty
.
The
drizzle
was
slacking_off
now
,
but
the
light
was
grayer
.
With
enormous
interest
,
Adam
watched
his
hands
as
they
touched
and
shifted
the
objects
on
the
board
directly
before
him
.
Into
the
emptiness
of
the
street
,
and
his
spirit
,
moved
a
form
.
The
form
was
swathed
in
an
army
blanket
,
much
patched
,
fastened
at
the
neck
with
a
cord
.
From
under
the
shapeless
huddle
of
blanket
the
feet
moved
in
the
mud
.
The
feet
wore
army
shoes
,
in
obvious
disrepair
.
The
head
was
wrapped
in
a
turban
and
on
top
of
the
turban
rode
a
great
hamper
across
which
a
piece
of
poncho
had
been
flung
.
The
gray
face
stared
straight
ahead
in
the
drizzle
.
Moisture
ran_down
the
cheeks
,
gathered
at
the
tip
of
the
nose
,
and
at
the
chin
.
The
figure
was
close
enough
now
for
him
to
see
the
nose
twitching
to
dislodge
the
drop
clinging
there
.
The
figure
stopped
and
one
hand
was
perilously
freed
from
the
hamper
to
scratch
the
nose
.
Then
the
figure
moved_on
.
This
was
one
of
the
Irish
women
who
had
built
their
own
huts
down
near
the
river
.
They
did
washing
.
Adam
recognized
this
one
.
He
recognized
her
because
she
was
the
one
who
,
in
a
winter
twilight
,
on
the
edge
of
camp
,
had
once
stopped
him
and
reached
down
her
hand
to
touch
his
fly
.
``
Slice
o_'
mutton
,
bhoy
''
?
she
had
queried
in
her
soft
guttural
.
``
Slice
o_'
mutton
''
?
Her
name
was
Mollie
.
They
called
her
Mollie_the_Mutton
,
and
laughed
.
Looking
down
the
street
after
her
,
Adam
saw
that
she
had
again
stopped
and
again
removed
one
hand
from
the
basket
.
He
could
not
make_out
,
but
he
knew
that
again
she
was
scratching
her
nose
.
Mollie_the_Mutton
was
scratching
her
nose
.
The
words
ran
crazily
in
his
head
:
Mollie_the_Mutton
is
scratching
her
nose
in
the
rain
.
Then
the
words
fell_into
a
pattern
:
``
Mollie_the_Mutton
is
scratching
her
nose
,
Scratching
her
nose
in
the
rain
.
Mollie_the_Mutton
is
scratching
her
nose
in
the
rain
''
.
The
pattern
would
not
stop
.
It
came
again_and_again
.
He
felt
trapped
in
that
pattern
,
in
the
repetition
.
Suddenly
he
thought
he
might
weep
.
``
What
's
the_matter
with
me
''
?
he
demanded
out_loud
.
He
looked
wildly
around
,
at
the
now
empty
street
,
at
the
mud
,
at
the
rain
.
``
Oh
,
what
's
the_matter
with
me
''
?
he
demanded
.
When
he
had
stored
his
stock
in
the
great
oak
chest
,
locked
the
two
big
hasps
and
secured
the
additional
chain
,
tied
the
fly
of
the
tent
,
and
picked_up
the
cash
box
,
he
moved_up
the
darkening
street
.
He
would
consign
the
cash
box
into
the
hands
of
Jed_Hawksworth
,
then
stand_by
while
his
employer
checked
the
contents
and
the
list
of
items
sold
.
Then
he
-
Then
what
?
He
did
not
know
.
His
mind
closed
on
that
prospect
,
as
though
fog
had
descended
to
blot_out
a
valley
.
Far_off
,
in
the
dusk
,
he
heard
voices
singing
,
muffled
but
strong
.
In
one
of
the
huts
a
group
of
men
were
huddled_together
,
singing
.
He
stopped
.
He
strained
to
hear
.
He
heard
the
words
:
``
Rock_of_Ages
,
cleft
for
me
,
Let
me
hide
myself
in
Thee
!
Let
the
water
and
the
blood
From
Thy
riven
side
''
.
He
thought
:
I
am
a
Jew
from
Bavaria
.
He
was
standing
there
,
he
thought
,
in
Virginia
,
in
the
thickening
dusk
,
in
a
costly
greatcoat
that
had
belonged_to
another
Jew
.
That
other
Jew
,
a
young_man
too
,
had
left
that
greatcoat
behind
,
in
a
rich
house
,
and
marched
away
.
He
had
crossed
the
river
which
now
,
beyond
the
woods
yonder
,
was
sliding
darkly
under
the
mist
.
He
had
plunged
into
the
dark
woods
beyond
.
He
had
died
there
.
What
had
that
man
,
that
other
young
Jew
,
felt
as
he
stood
in
the
twilight
and
heard
other
men
,
far_away
,
singing
together
?
.
Adam
thought_of
the
hutments
,
regiment
after
regiment
,
row
after
row
,
the
thousands
of
huts
,
stretching
away
into
the
night
.
He
thought_of
the
men
,
the
nameless
thousands
,
huddling
in
them
.
He
thought_of
Simms_Purdew
snoring
on
his
bunk
while
Pullen_James
crouched
by
the
hearth
,
skirmishing
an
undershirt
for
lice
,
and
a
wet
log
sizzled
.
He
thought_of
Simms_Purdew
,
who
once
had
risen
at
the
edge
of
a
cornfield
,
a
maniacal
scream
on
his
lips
,
and
swung
a
clubbed
musket
like
a
flail
to
beat
down
the
swirl
of
Rebel
bayonets
about
him
.
He
thought_of
Simms_Purdew
rising_up
,
fearless
in
glory
.
He
felt
the
sweetness
of
pity
flood
through
him
,
veining
his
very
flesh
.
Those
men
,
lying
in
the
huts
,
they
did
not
know
.
They
did
not
know
who
they
were
or
know
their
own
worth
.
In
the
pity
for
them
his
loneliness
was
gone
.
Then
he
thought_of
Aaron_Blaustein
standing
in
his
rich
house
saying
:
``
God
is
tired_of
taking
the
blame
.
He
is
going_to
let
History
take
the
blame
for_a_while
''
.
He
thought_of
the
old_man
laughing
under
the
glitter
of
the
great
chandelier
.
He
thought
:
Only
in
my
heart
can
I
make
the
world
hang_together
.
Adam
rose
from
the
crouch
necessary
to
enter
the
hut
.
He
saw
Mose
squatting
by
the
hearth
,
breaking_up
hardtack
into
a
pan
.
A
pot
was
boiling
on
the
coals
.
``
Done
give
Ole_Buckra
all
his
money
''
?
Mose
asked
softly
.
Adam
nodded
.
``
Yeah
''
,
Mose
murmured
,
``
yeah
.
And
look
what
he
done
give
us
''
.
Adam
looked
at
the
pot
.
``
What
is
it
''
?
he
asked
.
``
Chicken
''
,
Mose
said
,
and
theatrically
licked
his
lips
.
``
Gre't
big
fat
chicken
,
yeah
''
.
He
licked
his
lips
again
.
Then
:
``
Yeah
.
A
chicken
with
six
tits
and
a
tail
lak
a
corkscrew
.
And
hit
squealed
for
slop
''
.
Mose
giggled
.
``
Fooled
you
,
huh
?
It
is
the
same
ole
same
,
tell
me
hit
's
name
.
It
is
sowbelly
with
tits
on
.
It
is
salt_po'k
.
It
is
salt_po'k
and
skippers
.
That
po'k
,
it
was
so
full
of
skippers
it
would
jump
and
run
and
not
come
when
you
say
,
'
Hoo-pig
'
.
Had_to
put
my
foot
on_it
to
hole
it
down
while
I
cut
it
up
fer
the
lob-scuse
''
.
He
dumped
the
pan
of
crumbled
hardtack
into
the
boiling
pot
of
lobscouse
.
``
Good_ole
lob-scuse
''
,
he
mumbled
,
and
stirred
the
pot
.
He
stopped
stirring
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
.
``
Know
what
Ole_Buckra
et
tonight
''
?
he
demanded
.
``
Know
what
I
had_to
fix
fer
Ole
Him
''
?
Adam
shook
his
head
.
``
Chicken
''
,
Mose
said
.
