Now
that
he
knew
himself
to
be
self
he
was
free
to
grok
ever
closer
to
his
brothers
,
merge
without
let
.
Self
's
integrity
was
and
is
and
ever
had
been
.
Mike
stopped
to
cherish
all
his
brother
selves
,
the
many
threes-fulfilled
on
Mars
,
corporate
and
discorporate
,
the
precious
few
on
Earth
-
the
unknown
powers
of
three
on
Earth
that
would
be
his
to
merge
with
and
cherish
now
that
at_last
long
waiting
he
grokked
and
cherished
himself
.
Mike
remained
in
trance
;
there
was
much
to
grok
,
loose_ends
to
puzzle_over
and
fit
into
his
growing
-
all
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
and
been
at
the
Archangel_Foster_Tabernacle
(
not
just
cusp
when
he
and
Digby
had
come
face_to_face
alone
)
-
why
Bishop_Senator_Boone
made
him
warily
uneasy
,
how
Miss_Dawn_Ardent
tasted
like
a
water_brother
when
she
was
not
,
the
smell
of
goodness
he
had
incompletely
grokked
in
the
jumping_up_and_down
and
wailing
-
Jubal
's
conversations
coming
and
going
-
Jubal
's
words
troubled
him
most
;
he
studied
them
,
compared
them
with
what
he
had
been
taught
as
a
nestling
,
struggling
to
bridge
between
languages
,
the
one
he
thought
with
and
the
one
he
was
learning
to
think
in
.
The
word
``
church
''
which
turned_up
over_and_over_again
among
Jubal
's
words
gave
him
knotty
difficulty
;
there
was
no
Martian
concept
to
match
it
-
unless
one
took
``
church
''
and
``
worship
''
and
``
God
''
and
``
congregation
''
and
many
other
words
and
equated
them
to
the
totality
of
the
only
world
he
had
known
during
growing
waiting
&
&
&
then
forced
the
concept
back
into
English
in_that
phrase
which
had
been
rejected
(
by
each
differently
)
by
Jubal
,
by
Mahmoud
,
by
Digby
.
``
Thou
art
God
''
.
He
was
closer
to
understanding
it
in
English
now
,
although
it
could
never
have
the
inevitability
of
the
Martian
concept
it
stood_for
.
In
his
mind
he
spoke
simultaneously
the
English
sentence
and
the
Martian
word
and
felt
closer
grokking
.
Repeating
it
like
a
student
telling
himself
that
the
jewel
is
in
the
lotus
he
sank
into
nirvana
.
Before
midnight
he
speeded
his
heart
,
resumed
normal
breathing
,
ran_down
his
check_list
,
uncurled
and
sat_up
.
He
had
been
weary
;
now
he
felt
light
and
gay
and
clear-headed
,
ready
for
the
many
actions
he
saw
spreading_out
before
him
.
He
felt
a
puppyish
need
for
company
as
strong
as
his
earlier
necessity
for
quiet
.
He
stepped_out
into
the
hall
,
was
delighted
to
encounter
a
water_brother
.
``
Hi
''
!
``
Oh
.
Hello
,
Mike
.
My
,
you
look
chipper
''
.
``
I
feel
fine
!
Where
is
everybody
''
?
``
Asleep
.
Ben
and
Stinky
went_home
an
hour
ago
and
people
started
going_to_bed
''
.
``
Oh
''
.
Mike
felt
disappointed
that
Mahmoud
had
left
;
he
wanted
to
explain
his
new
grokking
.
``
I
ought
to
be
asleep
,
too
,
but
I
felt_like
a
snack
.
Are
you
hungry
''
?
``
Sure
,
I'm
hungry
''
!
``
Come_on
,
there
's
some
cold
chicken
and
we
'll
see
what
else
''
.
They
went
downstairs
,
loaded
a
tray
lavishly
.
``
Let
's
take
it
outside
.
It
's
plenty
warm
''
.
``
A
fine
idea
''
,
Mike
agreed
.
``
Warm
enough
to
swim
-
real
Indian_summer
.
I
'll
switch_on
the
floods
''
.
``
Do
n't
bother
''
,
Mike
answered
.
``
I
'll
carry
the
tray
''
.
He
could
see
in
almost
total_darkness
.
Jubal
said
that
his
night-sight
probably
came
from
the
conditions
in
which
he
had
grown_up
,
and
Mike
grokked
this
was
true
but
grokked
that
there
was
more
to_it
;
his
foster_parents
had
taught
him
to
see
.
As
for
the
night
being
warm
,
he
would
have
been
comfortable
naked
on
Mount_Everest
but
his
water_brothers
had
little
tolerance
for
changes
in
temperature
and
pressure
;
he
was
considerate
of
their
weakness
,
once
he
learned
of_it
.
But
he
was
looking_forward
to
snow
-
seeing
for
himself
that
each
tiny
crystal
of
the
water
of
life
was
a
unique
individual
,
as
he
had
read
-
walking
barefoot
,
rolling
in
it
.
In_the_meantime
he
was
pleased
with
the
warm
night
and
the
still
more
pleasing
company
of
his
water_brother
.
``
Okay
,
take
the
tray
.
I
'll
switch_on
the
underwater
lights
.
That
'll
be
plenty
to
eat
by
''
.
``
Fine
''
.
Mike
liked
having
light
up
through
the
ripples
;
it
was
a
goodness
,
beauty
.
They
picnicked
by
the
pool
,
then
lay
back
on
the
grass
and
looked
at
stars
.
``
Mike
,
there
's
Mars
.
It
is
Mars
,
is
n't
it
?
Or
Antares
''
?
``
It
is
Mars
''
.
``
Mike
?
What
are
they
doing
on
Mars
''
?
He
hesitated
;
the
question
was
too
wide
for
the
sparse
English_language
.
``
On
the
side
toward
the
horizon
-
the
southern_hemisphere
-
it
is
spring
;
plants
are
being
taught
to
grow
''
.
``
'
Taught
to
grow
''
'
?
He
hesitated
.
``
Larry
teaches
plants
to
grow
.
I
have
helped
him
.
But
my
people
-
Martians
,
I
mean
;
I
now
grok
you
are
my
people
-
teach
plants
another
way
.
In
the
other
hemisphere
it
is
growing
colder
and
nymphs
,
those
who
stayed
alive
through
the
summer
,
are
being
brought
into
nests
for
quickening
and
more
growing
''
.
He
thought
.
``
Of
the
humans
we
left
at
the
equator
,
one
has
discorporated
and
the
others
are
sad
''
.
Yes
,
I
heard
it
in
the
news
``
.
Mike
had
not
heard
it
;
he
had
not
known
it
until
asked
.
``
They
should
not
be
sad
.
Mr._Booker_T._W._Jones_Food_Technician
First_Class
is
not
sad
;
the
Old_Ones
have
cherished
him
''
.
``
You
knew
him
''
?
``
Yes
.
He
had
his
own
face
,
dark
and
beautiful
.
But
he
was
homesick
''
.
``
Oh
,
dear
!
Mike
&
&
&
do
you
ever
get
homesick
?
For
Mars
''
?
``
At_first
I
was
homesick
''
,
he
answered
.
``
I
was
lonely
always
''
.
He
rolled
toward
her
and
took
her
in
his
arms
.
``
But
now
I
am
not
lonely
.
I
grok
I
shall
never
be
lonely
again
''
.
``
Mike
darling
''
-
They
kissed
,
and
went_on
kissing
.
Presently
his
water_brother
said
breathlessly
.
``
Oh
,
my
!
That
was
almost
worse
than
the
first
time
''
.
``
You
are
all_right
,
my
brother
''
?
``
Yes
.
Yes
indeed
.
Kiss
me
again
''
.
A
long_time
later
,
by
cosmic
clock
,
she
said
,
``
Mike
?
Is
that
-
I
mean
,
'
Do
you
know
''
'
-
``
I
know
.
It
is
for
growing
closer
.
Now
we
grow
closer
''
.
``
Well
&
&
&
I
've
been
ready
a
long_time
-
goodness
,
we
all
have
,
but
&
&
&
never_mind
,
dear
;
turn
just
a_little
.
I
'll
help
''
.
As
they
merged
,
grokking
together
,
Mike
said
softly
and
triumphantly
:
``
Thou
art
God
''
.
Her
answer
was
not
in
words
.
Then
,
as
their
grokking
made
them
ever
closer
and
Mike
felt
himself
almost
ready
to
discorporate
her
voice
called
him
back
:
``
Oh
!
Oh
!
Thou
art
God
''
!
``
We
grok
God
''
.
On
Mars
humans
were
building
pressure_domes
for
the
male
and
female
party
that
would
arrive
by
next
ship
.
This
went
faster
than
scheduled
as
the
Martians
were
helpful
.
Part
of
the
time
saved
was
spent
on
a
preliminary
estimate
for
a
long-distance
plan
to
free
bound
oxygen
in
the
sands
of
Mars
to
make
the
planet
more
friendly
to
future
human
generations
.
The
Old_Ones
neither
helped
nor
hindered
this
plan
;
time
was
not_yet
.
Their
meditations
were
approaching
a
violent
cusp
that
would
shape
Martian
art
for
many
millennia
.
On
Earth
elections
continued
and
a
very
advanced
poet
published
a
limited_edition
of
verse
consisting
entirely
of
punctuation_marks
and
spaces
;
Time_magazine
reviewed
it
and
suggested
that
the
Federation_Assembly_Daily_Record
should
be
translated
into
the
medium
.
A
colossal
campaign
opened
to
sell
more
sexual
organs
of
plants
and
Mrs._Joseph_Shadow_of_Greatness_Douglas
was
quoted
as
saying
:
``
I
would
no_more
sit_down
without
flowers
on
my
table
than
without
serviettes
''
.
A
Tibetan
swami
from
Palermo
,
Sicily
,
announced
in
Beverly_Hills
a
newly
discovered
,
ancient
yoga
discipline
for
ripple
breathing
which
increased
both
pranha
and
cosmic
attraction
between
sexes
.
His
chelas
were
required
to
assume
the
matsyendra
posture
dressed
in
hand-woven
diapers
while
he
read
aloud
from
Rig-Veda
and
an
assistant
guru
examined
their
purses
in
another
room
-
nothing
was
stolen
;
the
purpose
was
less
immediate
.
The
President_of_the_United_States
proclaimed
the
first
Sunday
in
November
as
``
National_Grandmothers_'_Day
''
and
urged
America
to
say
it
with
flowers
.
A
funeral_parlor
chain
was
indicted
for
price-cutting
.
Fosterite
bishops
,
after
secret
conclave
,
announced
the
Church
's
second
Major_Miracle
:
Supreme_Bishop_Digby
had
been
translated
bodily
to
Heaven
and
spot-promoted
to
Archangel
,
ranking
with-but-after
Archangel_Foster
.
The
glorious
news
had
been
held_up
pending
Heavenly
confirmation
of
the
elevation
of
a
new
Supreme_Bishop
,
Huey_Short
-
a
candidate
accepted
by
the
Boone
faction
after
lots
had
been
cast
repeatedly
.
L'Unita
and
Hoy
published
identical
denunciations
of
Short
's
elevation
,
l'Osservatore_Romano
and
the
Christian_Science_Monitor
ignored
it
,
Times_of_India
snickered
at
it
,
and
the
Manchester_Guardian
simply
reported
it
-
the
Fosterites
in
England
were
few
but
extremely
militant
.
Digby
was
not
pleased
with
his
promotion
.
The
Man_from_Mars
had
interrupted
him
with
his
work
half
finished
-
and
that
stupid
jackass
Short
was
certain
to
louse_it_up
.
Foster
listened
with
angelic
patience
until
Digby
ran_down
,
then
said
,
``
Listen
,
junior
,
you
're
an
angel
now
-
so
forget
it
.
Eternity
is
no
time
for
recriminations
.
You
too
were
a
stupid
jackass
until
you
poisoned
me
.
Afterwards
you
did
well
enough
.
Now
that
Short
is
Supreme_Bishop
he
'll
do
all_right
,
he
can
n't
help
it
.
Same
as
with
the
Popes
.
Some
of
them
were
warts
until
they
got
promoted
.
Check
with
one
of
them
,
go_ahead
-
there
's
no
professional
jealousy
here
''
.
Digby
calmed_down
,
but
made
one
request
.
Foster
shook
his
halo
.
``
You
can
n't
touch
him
.
You
should
n't
have
tried
to
.
Oh
,
you
can
submit
a
requisition
for
a
miracle
if
you
want
to
make
a
fool
of
yourself
.
But
,
I'm
telling
you
,
it
'll
be
turned_down
-
you
do
n't
understand
the
System
yet
.
The
Martians
have
their
own
setup
,
different
from
ours
,
and
as_long_as
they
need
him
,
we
can
n't
touch
him
.
They
run_their_show
their
way
-
the
Universe
has
variety
,
something
for
everybody
-
a
fact
you
field
workers
often
miss
''
.
``
You
mean
this
punk
can
brush
me
aside
and
I
've
got_to
hold
still
for
it
''
?
``
I
held
still
for
the
same
thing
,
did
n't
I
?
I'm
helping
you
now
,
am
I
not
?
Now
look
,
there
's
work
to
be
done
and
lots
of
it
.
The
Boss
wants
performance
,
not
gripes
.
If
you
need
a
Day_off
to
calm_down
,
duck
over
to
the
Muslim_Paradise
and
take
it
.
Otherwise
,
straighten
your
halo
,
square
your
wings
,
and
dig_in
.
The
sooner
you
act
like
an
angel
the
quicker
you
'll
feel
angelic
.
Get
Happy
,
junior
''
!
Digby
heaved
a
deep
ethereal
sigh
.
``
Okay
,
I'm
Happy
.
Where
do
I
start
''
?
Jubal
did
not
hear
of
Digby
's
disappearance
when
it
was
announced
,
and
,
when
he
did
,
while
he
had
a
fleeting
suspicion
,
he
dismissed
it
;
if
Mike
had
had_a_finger_in
it
,
he
had
gotten_away_with
it
-
and
what
happened
to
supreme
bishops
worried
Jubal
not
at_all
as_long_as
he
was
n't
bothered
.
His
household
had
gone_through
an
upset
.
Jubal
deduced
what
had
happened
but
did
not
know
with
whom
-
and
did
n't
want
to
inquire
.
Mike
was
of
legal_age
and
presumed
able
to
defend
himself
in
the
clinches
.
Anyhow
,
it
was
high_time
the
boy
was
salted
.
Jubal
could
n't
reconstruct
the
crime
from
the
way
the
girls
behaved
because
patterns
kept
shifting
-
ABC
vs
D
,
then
BCD
vs
A
&
&
&
or
AB
vs
CD
,
or
AD
vs
CB
,
through
all
ways
that
four
women
can
gang_up
on
each
other
.
This
continued
most
of
the
week
following
that
ill-starred
trip
to
church
,
during
which
period
Mike
stayed
in
his
room
and
usually
in
a
trance
so
deep
that
Jubal
would
have
pronounced
him
dead
had
he
not
seen
it
before
.
Jubal
would
not
have
minded
it
if
service
had
not
gone_to_pieces
.
The
girls
seemed
to
spend
half
their
time
tiptoeing
in
``
to
see
if
Mike
was
all_right
''
and
they
were
too
preoccupied
to
cook
,
much
less
be
secretaries
.
Even
rock-steady
Anne
-
Hell
,
Anne
was
the
worst
!
Absent-minded
,
subject_to
unexplained
tears
.
Jubal
would
have
bet
his
life
that
if
Anne
were
to
witness
the
Second_Coming
,
she
would
memorize
date
,
time
,
personae
,
events
,
and
barometric_pressure
without
batting
her
calm
blue
eyes
.
