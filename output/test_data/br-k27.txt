``
But
tell
me
,
doctor
,
where
do
you
plan
to
conduct
the
hatching
''
?
Alex
asked
.
``
That
will
have
to
be
in
the
hotel
''
,
the
doctor
retorted
,
confirming
Alex
's
anticipations
.
``
What
I
want
you
to
do
is
to
go_to
the
market
with
me
early
tomorrow
morning
and
help
smuggle
the
hen
back
into
the
hotel
''
.
The
doctor
paid
the
bill
and
they
repaired_to
the
hotel
,
room
number
nine
,
to
initiate
Alex
further
into
these
undertakings
.
The
doctor
opened
the
smallest
of
his
cases
,
an
unimposing
straw
bag
,
and
exposed
the
contents
for
Alex
's
inspection
.
Inside
,
carefully
packed
in
straw
,
were
six
eggs
,
but
the
eye
of
a
poultry
psychologist
was
required
to
detect
what
scientifically
valuable
specimentalia
lay
inside
;
to
Alex
they
were
merely
six
not
unusual
hens
'
eggs
.
There
was
little
enough
time
to
contemplate
them
,
however
;
in
an
instant
the
doctor
was
stalking
across
the
room
with
an
antique
ledger
in
his
hands
,
thoroughly
eared
and
big
as
a
table_top
.
He
placed
it
on
Alex
's
lap
.
``
This
is
my
hen
ledger
''
,
he
informed
him
in
an
absorbed
way
.
``
It
's
been
going
since
1908
when
I
was
a
junior
in
college
.
That
first
entry
there
is
the
Vermont_Flumenophobe
,
the
earliest
and
one
of
the
most
successful
of
my
eighty-three
varieties
-
great
big
scapulars
and
hardly
any
primaries
at_all
.
Could
n't
take
them
near
a
river
,
though
,
or
they
'd
squawk
like
a
turkey_cock
the
day
before
Thanksgiving
''
.
The
ledger
was
full
of
most
precise
information
:
date
of
laying
,
length
of
incubation_period
,
number
of
chicks
reaching
the
first
week
,
second
week
,
fifth
week
,
weight
of
hen
,
size
of
rooster
's
wattles
and_so_on
,
all
scrawled
out
in
a
hand
that
looked
more
Chinese
than
English
,
the
most
jagged
and
sprawling
Alex
had
ever
seen
.
Below
these
particulars
was
a
series
of
alpha
beta
gammas
connected
by
arrows
and
crosses
which
denoted
the
lineage
of
the
breed
.
Alex
's
instruction
was
rapid
,
for
the
doctor
had_to
go_off
to
the
Rue_Ecole_de_Medecine
to
hear
more
speeches
with
only
time
for
one
sip
of
wine
to
sustain
him
through
them
all
.
But
after
the
doctor
's
return
that
night
Alex
could
see
,
from
the
high
window
in
his
own
room
,
the
now
familiar
figure
crouched
on
a
truly
impressive
heap
of
towels
,
apparently
giving
its
egg
hatching
powers
one
final
chance
before
it
was
replaced
in
its
office
by
a
sure-enough
hen
.
A
knocking
at
Alex
's
door
roused
him
at
six
o'clock
the
following
morning
.
It
was
the
doctor
,
dressed
and
ready
for
the
expedition
to
the
market
,
and
Alex
was
obliged
to
prepare
himself
in_haste
.
The
doctor
stood
about
,
waiting
for
Alex
to
dress
,
with
a
show
of
impatience
,
and
soon
they
were
moving
,
as
quietly
as
could
be
,
through
the
still
dark
hallways
,
past
the
bedroom
of
the
patronne
,
and
so
into
the
street
.
The
market
was
not
far
and
,
once
there
,
the
doctor
's
sense
of
immediacy
left
him
and
he
fell
into
a
state
of
harmony
with
the
birds
around
him
.
He
stroked
the
hens
and
they
responded
with
delighted
clucks
,
he
gobbled
with
the
turkeys
and
they
at_once
were
all
attention
,
he
quacked
with
the
ducks
,
and
cackled
with
a
pair
of
exceedingly
flattered
geese
.
The
dawn
progressed
and
it
seemed
that
the
doctor
would
never
be
done_with
his
ministrations
when
quite
abruptly
something
broke
his
revery
.
It
was
a
fine
broody_hen
,
white
,
with
a
maternal
eye
and
a
striking
abundance
of
feathers
in
the
under
region
of
the
abdomen
.
The
doctor
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
professional
interests
have
found
scope
,
drew
Alex
's
attention
to
those
excellences
which
might
otherwise
have
escaped
him
:
the
fine
color
in
comb
and
wattles
,
the
length
and
quality
of
neck
and
saddle_hackles
,
the
firm
,
wide
spread
of
the
toes
,
and
a
rare
justness
in
the
formation
of
the
ear
lappets
.
All
search
was
ended
;
he
had
found
his
fowl
.
The
purchase
was
effected
and
they
made_their_way
towards
the
hotel
again
,
the
hen
,
with
whom
some
sort
of
communication
had
been
set_up
,
nestling
in
the
doctor
's
arms
.
The
clocks
struck
seven-thirty
as
they
approached
the
hotel
entrance
;
and
hopes
that
the
chambermaid
and
patronne
would
still
be
abed
began
to
rise
in
Alex
's
well
exercised
breast
.
The
doctor
was
wearing
a
long
New_England
greatcoat
,
hardly
necessary
in
the
June
weather
but
a
garment
which
proved
well
adapted
to
the
sequestration
of
hens
.
Alex
entered
first
and
was
followed
by
the
doctor
who
,
for
all
his
care
,
manifested
a
perceptible
bulge
on
his
left
side
where
the
hen
was
cradled
.
They
advanced
in
a
line
across
the
entrance_hall
to
the
stairway
and
up
,
with
gingerly
steps
,
towards
the
first
landing
.
It
was
then
that
they
heard
the
tread
of
one
descending
and
,
in
some
perturbation
glancing
up
,
saw
the
patronne
coming
towards
them
as
they
gained
the
landing
.
``
Bonjour
,
messieurs
,
vous
etes
matinals
''
,
she
greeted
them
pleasantly
.
Alex
explained
that
they
had
been
out
for
a
stroll
before
breakfast
while
the
doctor
edged
around
behind
him
,
attempting
to
hide
the
protuberance
at
his
left
side
behind
Alex
's
arm
and
back
.
``
Vous
voulez
vos
petits
dejeuners
tout
de
suite
alors
''
?
their
hostess
enquired
.
Alex
told
her
that
there
was
no
hurry
for
their
breakfasts
,
trying
at_the_same_time
to
effect
a
speedy
separation
of
the
persons
before
and
behind
him
.
The
doctor
,
he
noticed
,
was
attempting
a
transverse
movement
towards
the
stairs
,
but
before
the
movement
could
be
completed
a
distinct
and
audible
cluck
ruffled
the
air
in
the
hollow
of
the
stair-well
.
Eyes
swerved
in
the
patronne
's
head
,
Alex
coughed
loudly
,
and
the
doctor
,
with
a
sforzando
of
chicken
noises
floating
behind
him
,
took
to
the
stairs
in
long_shanked
leaps
.
``
Comment
''
?
ejaculated
the
surprised
woman
,
looking
at
Alex
for
an
explanation
but
he
,
parting
from
her
without
ceremony
,
only
offered
a_few
words
about
the
doctor
's
provincial
American
speech
and
a
state
of
nerves
brought_on
by
the
demands
of
his
work
.
With_that
he
hurried
up_the_stairs
,
followed
by
her
suspicious
gaze
.
When
Alex
entered
his
room
,
the
doctor
was
already
preparing
a
nest
in
the
straw
case
,
six
eggs
ready
for
the
hen
's
attentions
.
There
was
no
reference
to
the
incident
on
the
stairs
,
his
powers
being
absorbed
by
this
more
immediate
business
.
The
hen
appeared
to
have
no
doubts
as
to
her
duties
and
was
quick
to
settle_down
to
the
performance
of
them
.
One
part
of
her
audience
was
totally
engaged
,
the
connoisseur
witnessing
a
peculiarly
fine
performance
of
some
ancient
classic
,
the
other
part
,
the
guest
of
the
connoisseur
,
attentive
as
one
who
must
take
an
intelligent
interest
in_that
which
he
does
not
fully
understand
.
The
spectacle
progressed
towards
a
denouement
which
was
obviously
still
remote
;
the
audience
attended
.
Time
elapsed
but
the
doctor
was
obviously
unconscious
of
its
passage
until
an
unwelcome
knock
on
the
door
interrupted
the
processes
of
nature
.
Startled
,
he
jumped
up
to
pull
hen
and
case
out
of
view
,
and
Alex
went_to
the
door
.
He
opened
it
a
crack
and
in
doing
so
made
as
much
shuffling
,
coughing
,
and
scraping
noise
as
possible
in_order
to
drown
emanations
from
the
hen
who
had
begun
to
protest
.
It
was
Giselle
,
the
fille_de_chambre
,
come
to
clean
the
room
,
and
while
she
stood
before
him
with
ears
pricked_up
and
regard
all
curiosity
,
explaining
her
errand
,
Alex
could
see
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
the
doctor
doing
all
he
could
to
calm
the
displeased
bird
.
Giselle
was
reluctant
but
Alex
succeeded
in
persuading
her
to
come_back
in
five
minutes
and
the
door
was
shut
again
.
``
Who
was
that
,
young
feller
''
?
the
doctor
instantly
asked
.
``
That
was
the
fille_de_chambre
,
the
one
you
thought
could
n't
get
the
eggs
out
.
She
looked
mighty
interested
,
though
.
Anyhow
she
's
coming_back
in
five
minutes
to
do
the
room
''
.
The
doctor
's
mind
was
working
at
a
great
speed
;
he
rose
to
put
his
greatcoat
on
and
addressed
Alex
in
a
muted
voice
.
``
Have
you
got
our
keys
handy
''
?
``
Right
in
my
pocket
''
.
``
All_right
.
Now
you
go
outside
and
beckon
me
when
it
's
safe
''
.
The
hall
was
empty
and
Alex
beckoned
;
they
climbed
the
stairs
which
creaked
,
very_loudly
to
their
sensitive
ears
,
and
reached
the
next
floor
.
A
guest
was
locking
his
room
;
they
passed
behind
him
and
got
to
Alex
's
room
unnoticed
.
The
doctor
sat_down
rather
wearily
,
caressing
the
hen
and
remarking
that
the
city
was
not
the
place
for
a
poultry
loving
man
,
but
no_sooner
was
the
remark
out
than
a
knock
at
this
door
obliged
him
to
cover
the
hen
with
his
greatcoat
once_more
.
At
the
door
Alex
managed
to
persuade
the
increasingly
astonished
fille_de_chambre
to
return
in
ten
minutes
.
It
was
evident
that
a
second
transfer
had
to
be
effected
,
and
that
it
had
to
take_place
between
the
time
the
fille
finished
the
doctor
's
room
and
the
time
she
began
Alex
's
.
They
waited
three
minutes
and_then
crept
out
on
tip-toe
;
the
halls
were
empty
and
they
passed
down_the_stairs
to
number
nine
and
listened
at
the
door
.
A
bustle
of
sheets
being
smoothed
and
pillows
being
arranged
indicated
the
fille_de_chambre
's
presence
inside
;
they
listened
and
suddenly
a
step
towards
the
door
announced
another
important
fact
.
The
doctor
shot_down
to
the
lavatory
and
turned
the
doorknob
,
but
to
no
effect
:
the
lavatory
was
occupied
.
Although
a
look
of
alarm
passed_over
his
face
,
he
did
not
arrest
his
movements
but
disappeared
into
the
shower_room
just
as
the
chambermaid
emerged
from
number
nine
.
Alex
suppressed
those
expressions
of
relief
which
offered
to
prevail
in
his
face
and
escape
from
his
throat
;
unwarranted
they
were
in_any_case
for
,
as
he
stood
facing
the
fille_de_chambre
,
his
ears
were
assailed
by
new
sounds
from
the
interior
of
the
shower_room
.
The
events
of
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
,
mysterious
to
any
bird
accustomed
only
to
the
predictable
life
of
coop
and
barnyard
,
had
overcome
the
doctor
's
hen
and
she
gave_out
a
series
of
cackly
wails
,
perhaps
mourning
her
nest
,
but
briefly
enjoyed
.
The
doctor
's
wits
had
not
left
him
,
however
,
for
all
his
sixty-eight
years
,
and
the
wails
were
almost
immediately
lost
in
the
sound
of
water
rushing_out
from
the
showerhead
.
Alex
nodded
to
the
maid
as
though
nothing
unusual
were
taking_place
and
entered
the
doctor
's
room
.
Shortly
,
the
doctor
himself
entered
,
his
hair
somewhat
wet
from
the
shower
,
but
evidently
satisfied
with
the
outcome
of
their
adventures
.
Without
comment
he
opened
the
closet
and
from
its
shelves
constructed
a
highboard
around
the
egg
case
which
he
had
placed
on
the
floor
inside
.
Next
,
the
hen
was
nested
and
all
seemed
well
.
The
two
men
sat
for
some
time
,
savoring
the
pleasure
of
escape
from
peril
and
the
relief
such
escape
brings
,
before
they
got_up
and
left
the
hotel
,
the
doctor
to
go_to
the
conference_house
and
Alex
to
go_to
the
main
post_office
.
Alex
returned
to
the
hotel
,
rather
weary
and
with
no
new
prospects
of
a
role
,
in
the
late
afternoon
,
but
found
the
doctor
in
an
ebullient
mood
.
At
the
time
Alex
arrived
he
was
engaged
in
some
sort
of
intimate
communication
with
the
hen
,
who
had
settled
herself
on
the
nest
most
peacefully
after
the
occurrences
of
the
morning
.
``
Chickens
have
short
memories
''
,
the
doctor
remarked
,
``
that
's
why
they
are
better
company
than
most
people
I
know
''
,
and
he
went_on
to
break
some
important
news
to
Alex
.
``
Well
''
,
he
began
,
``
It
seems
like
some
people
in
Paris
want
to
hear
more
from
me
than
those
fellers
over
at
the
conference_house
do
.
They
've
got
a
big
vulture
from
Tanganika
at
the
zoo
here
,
with
a
wife
for
him
,
too
,
very
rare
birds
,
both
of
them
,
the
only
Vulturidae
of
their
species
outside
Africa
.
Seems
like
she
's
willing
,
but
the
male
just
flops
around
all
day
like
the
bashful
boy
who
took
Jeannie_May
behind
the
barn
and_then
did
n't
know
what
to
do
,
and
the
people
at
the
zoo
have
n't
got
any
vulture
chicks
to
show
for
their
trouble
.
