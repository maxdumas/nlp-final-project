The
letters
of
the
common_soldiers
are
rich_in
humor
.
Indeed
,
no
richer
humor
is
to
be
found
in
the
whole
of
American
literature
than
in
the
letters
of
the
semi-literate
men
who
wore
the
blue
and
the
gray
.
Some
of
their
figures_of_speech
were
colorful
and
expressive
.
A
Confederate
observed
that
the
Yankees
were
:
``
thicker
than
lise
on
a
hen
and
a
dam
site
ornraier
''
.
Another
reported
that
his
comrades
were
``
in
fine
spirits
pitching
around
like
a
blind
dog
in
a
meat_house
''
.
A
third
wrote
that
it
was
``
raining
like
poring
peas
on
a
rawhide
''
.
Yanks
were
equally
adept
at
figurative
expression
.
One
wrote
:
``
[
I
am
so
hungry
]
I
could
eat
a
rider
off
his
horse
+
snap_at
the
stirups
''
.
A
second
reported
that
the
dilapidated
houses
in
Virginia
``
look_like
the
latter
end
of
original_sin
and
hard_times
''
.
A
third
remarked
of
slowness
of
Southerners
:
``
They
moved
about
from
corner
to
corner
,
as
uneasy
as
a
litter
of
hungry
leaches
on
the
neck
of
a
wooden
god
''
.
Still
another
,
annoyed
by
the
brevity
of
a
recently
received
missive
,
wrote
:
``
Yore
letter
was
short_and_sweet
,
jist
like
a
roasted
maget
''
.
A
Yankee
sergeant
gave
the
following
description
of
his
sweetheart
:
``
My
girl
is
none
of
your
one-horse
girls
.
She
is
a
regular
stub_and_twister
,
double_geered
.
She
is
well-educated
and
refined
,
all
wildcat
and
fur
,
and
Union
from
the
muzzle
to
the
crupper
''
.
Humor
found
many
modes
of
expression
.
A
Texan
wrote
to
a
male
companion
at
home
:
``
What
has
become
of
Halda
and
Laura
?
When
you
see
them
again
give
them
my
love
-
not
best
respects
now
,
but
love
by
God
''
.
William_R._Stillwell
,
an
admirable
Georgian
whose
delightful
correspondence
is
preserved
in
the
Georgia_Department_of_Archives_and_History
,
liked
to
tease
his
wife
in
his
letters
.
After
he
had
been
away
from
home
about
a
year
he
wrote
:
``
[
Dear
Wife
]
If
I
did
not
write
and
receive
letters
from
you
I
believe
that
I
would
forgit
that
I
was
married
I
do
n't
feel
much
like
a
maryed
man
but
I
never
forgit
it
sofar_as
to
court
enny
other
lady
but
if
I
should
you
must
forgive
me
as
I
am
so
forgitful
''
.
A
Yank
,
disturbed
by
his
increasing
corpulence
,
wrote
:
``
I
am
growing
so
fat
I
am
a
burden
2
myself
''
.
Another
Yank
parodied
the
familiar
bedtime
prayer
:
``
Now
I
lay
me
down
to
sleep
,
The
gray-backs
o
'
er
my
body
creep
;
If
they
should
bite
before
I
wake
,
I
pray
the
Lord
their
jaws
to
break
''
``
.
Charles_Thiot
,
a
splendid
Georgia
soldier
,
differed
from
most_of
his
comrades
in
the
ranks
in
that
he
was
the
owner
of
a
large
plantation
,
well-educated
,
and
nearly
fifty
years
of_age
.
But
he
was
very_much_like
his
associates
in
his
hatred
of
camp
routine
.
Near
the
end
of
his
service
he
wrote
that
when
the
war
was
over
he
was
going
to
buy
two
pups
,
name
one
of
them
``
fall-in
''
and
the
other
``
close-up
''
,
and_then
shoot
them
both
,
``
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
'
fall-in
'
and
'
close-up
''
'
.
The
soldiers
who
comprised
the
rank_and_file
of
the
Civil_War
armies
were
an
earthy
people
.
They
talked
and
wrote
much
about
the
elemental
functions
of
the
body
.
One
of
the
most
common
of
camp
maladies
was
diarrhoea
.
Men
of
more
delicate
sensibilities
referred
to
this
condition
as
``
looseness_of_the_bowels
''
;
but
a
much
more
common
designation
was
``
the_sh-ts
''
.
A
Michigan
soldier
stationed
in
Georgia
wrote
in
1864
:
``
I
expect
to
be
tough
as
a
knott
as_soon_as
I
get_over
the
Georgia
Shitts
''
.
Johnny_Rebs
from
the
deep_South
who
were
plagued
with
diarrhoea
after
transfer
to
the
Virginia
front
often
informed
their
families
that
they
were
suffering
from
the
``
the
Virginia
quickstep
''
.
A
Georgia
soldier
gave
his
wife
the
following
description
of
the
cause
and
consequence
of
diarrhoea
:
``
I
have
bin
a_little
sick
with
diorah
two
or
three
days
.
I
eat
too_much
eggs
and
poark
it
sowered
[
on
]
my
stomack
and
turn
loose
on
me
''
.
A
Michigan
soldier
wrote
his
brother
:
``
I
am
well
at_present
with
the
exception
I
have
got
the
Dyerear
and
I
hope
thease
few
lines
find
you
the
same
''
.
The
letters
which
poured
forth
from
camps
were
usually
written
under
adverse
circumstances
.
Save
for
brief
periods
in
garrison
or
winter
quarters
,
soldiers
rarely
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
a
writing_desk
or
table
.
Most_of
the
letters
were
written
in
the
hubbub
of
camp
,
on
stumps
,
pieces
of
bark
,
drum_heads
,
or
the
knee
.
In
the
South
,
after
the
first
year
of
the
war
,
paper
and
ink
were
very
poor
.
Scarcity
of
paper
caused
many
Southerners
to
adopt
the
practice
of
cross
writing
,
i._e.
,
after
writing
from
left
to
right
of
the
page
in
the
usual
manner
,
they
gave
the
sheet
a
half
turn
and
wrote
from
end
to
end
across
the
lines
previously
written
.
Sometimes
soldiers
wrote
letters
while
bullets
were
whizzing
about
their
heads
.
A
Yank
writing
from
Vicksburg
,
May
28
,
1863
,
stated
``
Not
less_than
50
balls
have
passed_over
me
since
I
commenced
writing
.
I
could
tell
you
of
plenty
narrow_escapes
,
but
we
take
no
notice
of
them
now
''
.
A
Reb
stationed
near
Petersburg
informed
his
mother
:
``
I
need
not
tell
you
that
I
dodge
pretty
often
,
for
you
can
see
that
very
plainly
by
the
blots
in
this
letter
.
Just
count
each
blot
a
dodge
and
add
in
a_few
for
I
do
n't
dodge
every
time
''
.
Another
Reb
writing
under
similar
circumstances
before
Atlanta
reported
:
``
The
Yankees
keep
Shooting
so
I
am
afraid
they
will
knock_over
my
ink
,
so
I
will
close
''
.
The
most
common
type
of
letter
was
that
of
soldier
husbands
to
their
wives
.
But
fathers
often
addressed
communications
to
their
small
children
;
and
these
,
full
of
homely
advice
,
are
among
the
most
human
and
revealing
of
Civil_War
letters
.
Rebs
who
owned
slaves
occasionally
would
include
in
their
letters
admonitions
or
greetings
to
members
of
the
Negro
community
.
Occasionally
they
would
write
to
the
slaves
.
Early
in
the
war
it
was
not
uncommon
for
planters
'
sons
to
retain
in
camp
Negro
``
body_servants
''
to
perform
the
menial
chores
such_as
cooking
,
foraging
,
cleaning
the
quarters
,
shining
shoes
,
and
laundering
clothes
.
Sometimes
these
servants
wrote
or
dictated
for
enclosure
with
the
letters
of
their
soldier
masters
messages
to
their
relatives
and
to
members
of
their
owners
'
families
.
Unmarried
soldiers
carried_on
correspondence
with
sweethearts
at
home
.
Owing
to
the
restrained
usages
characteristic
of
19_th
century
America
,
these
letters
usually
were
stereotyped
and
revealed
little
depth
of
feeling
.
Occasionally
gay
young
blades
would
write
vividly
to
boon
companions
at
home
about
their
amorous
exploits
in
Richmond
,
Petersburg
,
Washington
,
or
Nashville
.
But
these
comments
are
hardly
printable
.
An
Alabama
soldier
whose
feminine
associations
were
of
the
more
admirable
type
wrote
boastfully
of
his
achievements
among
the
Virginia
belles
:
``
They
thout
I
was
a
saint
.
I
told
them
some
sweet
lies
and
they
believed
it
all
.
I
would
tell
them
I
got
a
letter
from
home
stating
that
five
of
my
Negroes
had
run_away
and
ten
of
Pappies
But
I
wold
say
I
recond
he
did
not
mind
it
for
he
had
a
plenty
more
left
and_then
they
would
lean
to
me
like
a
sore_eyd
kitten
to
a
basin
of
milk
''
.
Some
of
the
letters
were
pungently
expressive
.
An
Ohio
soldier
who
,
from
a
comrade
just
returned
from
leave
,
received
an
unfavorable
comment
on
the
conduct
of
his
sister
,
took
pen
in
hand
and
delivered
himself
thus
:
``
[
Dear
Sis
]
Alf
sed
he
heard
that
you
and
hardy

a
runing

all_the_time
and

for

i

''
.
Initiation
into
combat
sometimes
elicited
from
soldier
correspondents
choice
comments
about
their
experiences
and
reactions
.
A
Federal
infantryman
wrote
to
his
father
shortly
after
his
first
skirmish
in
Virginia
:
``
Dear
Pa
.
Went_out
a
Skouting
yesterday
.
We
got
to
one
house
where
there
were
five
secessionist
they
brok
+
run
and
Arch
holored_out
to
shoot
the
ornery

and
we
all
let_go
at
them
.
Thay
may
say
what
they
please
but
godamit
Pa
it
is
fun
''
.
Some
of
the
choicest
remarks
made
by
soldiers
in
their
letters
were
in
disparagement
of
unpopular
officers
.
A
Mississippi
soldier
wrote
:
``
Our
General_Reub_Davis
is
a
vain
,
stuck-up
,
illiterate
ass
''
.
An
Alabamian
wrote
:
``
Col._Henry
is
[
an
ignoramus
]
fit
for
nothing
higher
than
the
cultivation
of
corn
''
.
A
Floridian
stated
that
his
officers
were
``
not
fit
to
tote_guts_to_a_bear
''
.
On
December
9
,
1862
,
Sergeant_Edwin_H._Fay
,
an
unusual
Louisianan
who
held
A._B.
and
M._A.
degrees
from
Harvard_University
and
who
before
the
war
was
headmaster
of
a
private_school
for
boys
in
Louisiana
,
wrote
his
wife
:
``
I
saw
Pemberton
and
he
is
the
most
insignificant
puke
I
ever
saw
.
His
head
cannot
contain
enough
sense
to
command
a
regiment
,
much
less
a
corps
.
Jackson
runs
first
and
his
Cavalry
are
well
drilled
to
follow
their
leader
.
He
is
not
worth
shucks
.
But
he
is
a
West_Point
graduate
and
therefore
must
be
born
to
command
''
.
Similar
comments
about
officers
are
to
be
found
in
the
letters
of
Northern
soldiers
.
A
Massachusetts
soldier
,
who
seems
to
have
been
a
Civil_War
version
of
Bill_Mauldin
,
wrote
:
``
The
officers
consider
themselves
as
made
of
a
different
material
from
the
low
fellows
in
the
ranks
.
They
get
all
the
glory
and
most_of
the
pay
and
do
n't
earn
ten
cents
apiece
on_the_average
,
the
drunken
rascals
''
.
Private
George_Gray_Hunter
of
Pennsylvania
wrote
:
``
I
am
well
convinced
in
My
own
Mind
that
had
it
not
been
for
officers
this
war
would
have
ended
long
ago
''
.
Another
Yankee
became
so
disgusted
as
to
state
:
``
I
wish
to
God
one_half
of
our
officers
were
knocked
in
the
head
by
slinging
them
against
[
the
other
half
]
''
.
No
group
of
officers
came_in_for
more
spirited
denunciation
than
the
doctors
.
One
Federal_soldier
wrote
:
``
The
docters
is
no_a_conte
.
hell
will
be
filde
with
do_[_c_]_ters
and
offersey
when
this
war
is
over
''
.
Shortly
after
the
beginning
of
Sherman
's
Georgia
campaign
,
an
ailing
Yank
wrote
his
homefolk
:
``
The
surgeon
insisted
on
Sending
me
to
the
hospital
for
treatment
.
I
insisted
on
takeing_the_field
and
prevailed
-
thinking
that
I
had_better
die
by
rebel
bullets
than
[
by
]
Union
quackery
''
.
The
attitudes
which
the
Rebs
and
Yanks
took
toward
each
other
were
very_much
the
same
and
ranged
over
the
same
gamut
of
feeling
,
from
friendliness
to
extreme
hatred
.
The
Rebs
were
,
to
a
Massachusetts
corporal
,
``
fighting
madmen
or
not
men
at_all
but
whiskey
+
gunpowder
put
into
a
human
frame
''
.
A
Pennsylvania
soldier
wrote
that
``
they
were
the
hardest
looking
set
of
men
that
Ever
i
saw
they
Looked
as
if
they
had
been
fed
on
vinegar
and
shavings
''
.
Private
Jenkins_Lloyd_Jones
of
the
Wisconsin_Light_Artillery
wrote
in
his
diary
:
``
I
strolled
among
the
Alabamans
on
the
right
,
found
some
of
the
greenest
specimens
of
humanity
I
think
in
the
universe
their
ignorance
being
little
less_than
the

they
despise

as
imperfect
a

They
Recooned
as
how

'
uns
all
would
be
a
heap

to

'
uns
all
''
'
.
In
a
similar
vein
,
but
writing
from
the
opposite
side
,
Thomas_Taylor
,
a
private
in
the
6_th
Alabama_Volunteers
,
in
a
letter
to
his
wife
,
stated
:
``
You
know
that
my
heart
is

you
but
I
never
could
have
been
satisfied
to
have
staid
