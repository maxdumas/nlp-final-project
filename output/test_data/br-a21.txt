A
jury
of
seven
men
and
five
women
found
21
-
year-old
Richard_Pohl
guilty
of
manslaughter
yesterday
in
the
bludgeon
slaying
of
Mrs._Anna_Hengesbach
.
Pohl
received
the
verdict
without
visible
emotion
.
He
returned
to
his
cell
in
the
county
jail
,
where
he
has
been
held
since
his
arrest
last
July
,
without
a
word
to
his
court-appointed
attorney
,
Jack_Walker
,
or
his
guard
.
The
verdict
brought
vindication
to
the
dead
woman
's
stepson
,
Vincent_Hengesbach
,
54
,
who
was
tried
for
the
same
crime
in
December
,
1958
,
and
released
when
the
jury
failed
to
reach
a
verdict
.
Mrs._Hengesbach
was
killed
on
Aug.
31
,
1958
.
Hengesbach
has
been
living
under
a
cloud
ever
since
.
When
the
verdict
came_in
against
his
young
neighbor
,
Hengesbach
said
:
``
I
am
very
pleased
to
have
the
doubt
of
suspicion
removed
.
Still
,
I
do
n't
wish
to
appear
happy
at
somebody
's
else
's
misfortune
''
.
Hengesbach
,
who
has
been
living_on
welfare
recently
,
said
he
hopes
to
rebuild
the
farm
which
was
settled
by
his
grandfather
in
Westphalia
,
27
miles
southwest
of
here
.
Hengesbach
has
been
living
in
Grand
Ledge
since
his
house
and
barn
were
burned_down
after
his
release
in
1958
.
Pohl
confessed
the
arson
while
being
questioned
about
several
fires
in
the
Westphalia
area
by
State_Police
.
He
also
admitted
killing
Mrs._Hengesbach
.
However
,
the
confession
,
which
was
the
only
evidence
against
him
,
was
retracted
before
the
trial
.
Assistant_Prosecutor_Fred_Lewis
,
who
tried
both
the
Hengesbach
and
Pohl
cases
,
said
he
did
not
know
what
would
be
done
about
two
arson
charges
pending
against
Pohl
.
Circuit_Judge_Paul_R._Cash
did
not
set
a
date
for
sentencing
.
Pohl
could
receive
from
1
to
15
years
in
prison
or
probation
.
Walker
said
he
was
considering
filing
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
would
contend
that
the
verdict
was
against
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
that
there
were
several
errors
in
trial
procedure
.
A
verdict
against
Pohl
came
at
4
:
05
p.
m.
after
almost
13
-
1
2
hours
of
deliberation
.
The
jury
,
which
was
locked_up
in
a
motel
overnight
,
was
canvassed
at
the
request
of
Walker
after
the
verdict
was
announced
.
The
jury
foreman
,
Mrs._Olive_Heideman
,
of
rural
Elsie
,
said
that
a
ballot
was
not
even
taken
until
yesterday
morning
and
that
the
first
day
of
deliberation
was
spent
in
going_over
the
evidence
.
She
said
the
jurors
agreed
that
Pohl
's
confession
was
valid
.
The
jury
asked
Judge_Cash
to
send
in
his
written
definition
of
the
difference
between
first
and
second-degree
murder
and
manslaughter
.
The
verdict
came
three
hours
later
.
Some
30
spectators
remained
in
the
court
during
the
day
and
were
to
hear
the
verdict
read
.
The
trial
had
packed
the
large
courtroom
for
more_than
a
week
.
A
Sterling_Township
family
of
six
surviving
children
,
whose
mother
died
yesterday
as
the
aftermath
to
a
fire
that
also
killed
one
of
the
children
,
found
today
they
had
the
help
of
hundreds
of
neighbors
and
school
friends
.
While
neighbor
women
assumed
some
of
the
dead
mother
's
duties
,
fund-raising
events
were
being
planned
by
a
homeowners
association
and
a
student
council
for
the
hard-hit
Henry_Kowalski
family
,
34220
Viceroy
.
Mrs._Eleanor_Kowalski
,
42
,
died
yesterday
afternoon
in
Holy_Cross_Hospital
of
burns
suffered
in
a
fire
that
followed
a
bottled_gas
explosion
Saturday
night
at
the
flat
of
her
widowed
mother
,
Mrs._Mary_Pankowski
,
in
the
adjoining
suburb
of
Warren
.
Funeral
services
for
Mrs._Kowalski
and
her
daughter
,
Christine
,
11
,
who
died
of
burns
at
the
same
hospital
Monday
,
have
been
scheduled
for
10
a.
m.
tomorrow
in
St._Anne
's
Catholic_Church
,
31978
Mound
,
in
Warren
.
The
mother
and
daughter
,
who
will
be
buried
side_by_side
in
Mt._Olivet_Cemetery
,
rested
together
today
in
closed
caskets
at
the
Lyle_Elliott
Funeral_Home
,
31730
Mound
,
Warren
.
Mrs._Pankowski
,
61
,
remained
in
Holy_Cross_Hospital
as
a
result
of
the
explosion
,
which
occurred
while
Mrs._Kowalski
fueled
a
cook
stove
in
the
grandmother
's
small
upstairs
flat
at
2274
Eight
Mile
road
east
.
Assistant
Fire_Chief
Chester_Cornell
said
gas
fumes
apparently
were
ignited
by
a
candle
which
one
of
the
three
Kowalski
girls
present
held
for
her
mother
,
because
the
flat
lacked
electricity
.
Christine
's
twin
sister
,
Patricia
,
and
Darlene_Kowalski
,
8
,
escaped
with
minor
burns
.
They
are
home
now
with
the
other
Kowalski
children
,
Vicky
,
14
;
Dennis
,
6
;
Eleanor
,

;
and
Bernardine
,

.
``
All
we
have
left
in
the
world
is
one
another
,
and
we
must
stay_together
the
way
Mother
wanted
''
,
Kowalski
said
in
telling
his
children
of
their
mother
's
death
yesterday
afternoon
.
Kowalski
,
a
roofer
who
seldom
worked
last
winter
,
already
was
in_arrears
on
their
recently
purchased
split-level
home
when
the
tragedy
staggered
him
with
medical
and
funeral
bills
.
Neighbor
women
,
such_as
Mrs._Sidney_Baker
,
2269
Serra
,
Sterling_Township
,
have
been
supplying
the
family
with
meals
and
handling
household
chores
with
Kowalski
's
sister-in-law
,
Mrs._Anna_Kowalski
,
22111
David
,
East_Detroit
.
Another
neighbor
,
Mrs._Frank_C._Smith
,
2731
Pall_Mall
,
Sterling_Township
,
surprised
Kowalski
by
coming
to
the
home
yesterday
with
$
135
collected
locally
toward
the
$
400
funeral
costs
.
John_C._Houghton
,
president
of
the
Tareytown_Acres_Homeowners_Association
,
followed
that
by
announcing
plans
last
night
for
a
door-to-door
fund
drive
throughout
their
subdivision
on
behalf
of
the
Kowalski
family
.
Houghton
said
6
p.
m._Friday
had
been
set
for
a
canvass
of
all
480
homes
in
the
subdivision
,
which
is
located
northeast
of
Dequindre
and
14
Mile
road
east
.
He
said
contributions
also
could
be
mailed
to
Post_Office
Box
553
,
Warren_Village_Station
.
Vicky_Kowalski
meanwhile
learned
that
several
of
her
fellow
students
had
collected
almost
$
25
for
her
family
during
the
lunch
hour
yesterday
at
Fuhrmann
Junior_High_School
,
5155
Fourteen
Mile
road
east
.
Principal_Clayton_W._Pohly
said
he
would
allow
a
further
collection
between
classes
today
,
and
revealed
that
Y-Teen_Club
past
surpluses
had
been
used
to
provide
a
private
hospital
nurse
Monday
for
Mrs._Kowalski
.
Student_Council
officers
announced
today
the
Kowalski
family
would
be
given
the
combined
proceeds
from
a
school
dance
held
two_weeks
ago
,
and
another
dance
for
Fuhrmann
's
770
students
this
Friday
night
.
``
Furhmann
's
faculty
is
proud
that
this
has
been
a
spontaneous
effort
,
started
largely
among
the
students
themselves
,
because
of
fondness
for
Vicky
and
sympathy
for
her
entire
family
,
Pohly
said
.
There
also
were
reports
of
a
collection
at
the
County_Line
Elementary_School
,
3505
o
Dequindre
,
which
has
been
attended
this
year
by
four
of
the
Kowalski
children
including
Christine
.
Kowalski
has
spoken
but
little
since
the
fire
last
Saturday
.
But
today
he
wanted
to
make
a
public
statement
.
``
I
never
knew
there
were
such
neighbors
and
friends
around
me
and
my
family
.
I
was
n't
sure
there
were
such
people
anywhere
in
the
world
.
I
'll
need
more_than
a
single
day
to
find
the
words
to
properly
express
my
thanks
to
them
''
.
An
alert
10
-
year-old
safety
patrol
boy
was
congratulated
by
police
today
for
his
part
in
obtaining
a
reckless
driving
conviction
against
a
youthful
motorist
.
Patrolman_George_Kimmell
,
of
McClellan_Station
,
said
he
would
recommend
a
special
safety
citation
for
Ralph_Sisk
,
9230
Vernor
east
,
a
third
grader
at
the
Scripps_School
,
for
his
assistance
in
the
case
.
Kimmell
said
he
and
Ralph
were
helping
children
across
Belvidere
at
Kercheval_Monday
afternoon
when
a
car
heading
north
on
Belvidere
stopped
belatedly
inside
the
pedestrian
crosswalk
.
Kimmell
ordered
the
driver
to
back_up
,
watched
the
children
safely
across
and
was
approaching
the
car
when
it
suddenly
``
took_off
at
high
speed
''
,
he
said
,
narrowly
missing
him
.
Commandeering
a
passing
car
,
Kimmell
pursued
the
fleeing
vehicle
,
but
lost
it
in
traffic
.
Returning
to
the
school_crossing
,
the
officer
was
informed
by
the
Sisk
boy
that
he
recognized
the
driver
,
a
neighbor
,
and
had
obtained
the
license_number
.
The
motorist
later
was
identified
as
Richard_Sarkees
,
17
,
of
2433
McClellan
,
currently
on
probation
and
under
court
order
not
to
drive
.
He
was
found
guilty
of
reckless
driving
yesterday
by
Traffic_Judge_George_T._Murphy
,
who
continued
his
no-driving
probation
for
another
year
and
ordered
him
to
spend
15
days
in
the
Detroit
House_of_Correction
.
The
jail
sentence
is
to
begin
the
day
after
Sarkees
graduates
from
Eastern
High_School
in
June
.
The
long
crisis
in
Laos
appeared
nearing
a
showdown
today
.
Britain
announced
that
it
is
asking
the
Soviet_Union
to
agree
tomorrow
to
an
immediate
cease-fire
.
In
Vientiane
,
the
royal
Laotian
government
decided
today
to
ask
its
``
friends
and
neighbors
''
for
help
in
fighting
what
it
called
a
new
rebel
offensive
threatening
the
southeast
Asian
kingdom
.
Britain
's
plans
to
press
Russia
for
a
definite
cease-fire
timetable
was
announced
in
London
by
Foreign_Secretary_Lord_Home
.
He
said
Britain
also
proposed
that
the
international
truce
commission
should
be
reconvened
,
sent
to
New_Delhi
and
from
there
to
Laos
to
verify
the
cease-fire
.
A
14
-
power
conference
on
Laos
should
then
meet
on
May
5
,
he
said
.
The
Laos
government
plea
for
help
was
made
by
Foreign_Minister
Tiao_Sopsaisana
.
He
indicated
that
requests
would
be
made_for
more
U._S.
arms
and
more
U._S.
military
advisers
.
He
declared
the
government
is
thinking_of
asking
for
foreign
troops
if
the
situation
worsens
.
One
of
the
first
moves
made
after
a
cabinet
decision
was
to
request
the
United_States
to
establish
a
full-fledged
military
assistance
group
instead
of
the
current
civilian
body
.
A
note
making
the
request
was
handed
to
U._S._Ambassador_Winthrop_G._Brown
.
The
Laos
government
said
four
major
Pathet_Lao
rebel
attacks
had
been
launched
,
heavily
supported
by
troops
from
Communist_North
Viet_Nam
.
The
minister
,
describing
the
attacks
which
led_up
to
the
appeal
,
said
that
60000
Communist_North
Vietnamese
were
fighting
royal
army
troops
on
one
front
-
near
Thakhek
,
in
southern-central
Laos
.
There
was
no
confirmation
of
such
massive
assaults
from
independent
sources
.
In_the_past
such
government
claims
have
been
found
exaggerated
.
Two
Americans
and
seven
Cubans
were
executed
by
firing_squads
today
as
Castro
military
tribunals
began
decreeing
the
death_penalty
for
captured
invasion
forces
and
suspected
collaborators
.
A
Havana
radio_broadcast
identified
the
Americans
as
Howard_Anderson
and
August_Jack_McNair
.
The
executions
took_place
at
dawn
only
a_few
hours
after
Havana
radio
announced
their
conviction
by
a
revolutionary
tribunal
at
Pinar_del_Rio
,
where
the
executions
took_place
.
The
broadcast
said
Anderson
,
a
Seattle
ex-marine
and
Havana
businessman
,
and
McNair
,
of
Miami
,
were
condemned
on
charges
of
smuggling
arms
to
Cuban
rebels
.
Anderson
operated
three
Havana
automobile
service_stations
and
was
commander
of
the
Havana
American_Legion
post
before
it
disbanded
since
the
start
of
Fidel_Castro
's
regime
.
Anderson
's
wife
and
four
children
live
in
Miami
.
McNair
,
25
,
was
seized
March
20
with
four
Cubans
and
accused
of
trying
to
land
a
boatload
of
rifles
in
Pinar_del_Rio
,
about
35
miles
from
Havana
.
At_least
20
other
Americans
were
reported
to
have
been
arrested
in
a
mass
political
roundup
.
Among
them
were
a_number_of
newsmen
,
including
Henry_Raymont
,
of
United_Press_International
,
and
Robert_Berrellez
,
of
Associated_Press
.
So
many
Cubans
were
reported
being
swept
into
the
Castro
dragnet
that
the
massive
Sports
Palace
auditorium
and
at_least
one
hotel
were
converted
into
makeshift
jails
.
More_than
1000
were
said
to
have
been
arrested
-
100
of
them
Roman_Catholic
priests
.
Of
the
millions
who
have
served
time
in
concentration_camps
in
Siberia
as
political_prisoners
of
the
Soviet
state
,
few
emerge
in
the
West
to
tell
about
it
.
M._Kegham
-
the
name
is
a
pseudynom
-
was
a
teacher
in
Bucharest
and
a
member
of
the
Armenian
Revolutionary_Federation
(
ARF
)
-
two
reasons
the
Communists
put
him
away
when
they
arrived
in
1945
.
Today
,
M._Kegham
was
in
Detroit
,
en_route
to
join
his
wife
and
children
in
California
.
