Consider
a
simple
,
closed
,
plane
curve
C
which
is
a
real
analytic
image
of
the
unit
circle
,
and
which
is
given
by
**f
.
These
are
real
analytic
periodic
functions
with
period
T
.
In
the
following
paper
it
is
shown
that
in
a
certain
definite
sense
,
exactly
an
odd
number
of
squares
can
be
inscribed
in
every
such
curve
which
does
not
contain
an
infinite
number
of
inscribed
squares
.
This
theorem
is
similar
to
the
theorem
of
Kakutani
that
there
exists
a
circumscribing
cube
around
any
closed
,
bounded
convex
set
in
**f
.
The
latter
theorem
has
been
generalized
by
Yamabe
and
Yujobo
,
and
Cairns
to
show
that
in
**f
there
are
families
of
such
cubes
.
Here
,
for
the
case
of
squares
inscribed
in
plane
curves
,
we
remove
the
restriction
to
convexity
and
give
certain
other
results
.
A
square
inscribed
in
a
curve
C
means
a
square
with
its
four
corner
points
on
the
curve
,
though
it
may_not
lie
entirely
in
the
interior
of
C
.
Indeed
,
the
spiral
**f
,
with
the
two
endpoints
connected
by
a
straight_line
possesses
only
one
inscribed
square
.
The
square
has
one
corner
point
on
the
straight_line
segment
,
and
does
not
lie
entirely
in
the
interior
.
On
C
,
from
the
point
P
at
**f
to
the
point
Q
at
**f
,
we
construct
the
chord
,
and
upon
the
chord
as
a
side
erect
a
square
in
such
a
way
that
as
s
approaches
zero
the
square
is
inside
C
.
As
s
increases
we
consider
the
two
free
corner
points
of
the
square
,
**f
and
**f
,
adjacent
to
P
and
Q
respectively
.
As
s
approaches
T
the
square
will
be
outside
C
and
therefore
both
**f
and
**f
must
cross
C
an
odd
number
of
times
as
s
varies
from
zero
to
T
.
The
points
may
also
touch
C
without
crossing
.
Suppose
**f
crosses
C
when
**f
.
We
now
have
certain
squares
with
three
corners
on
C
.
For
any
such
square
the
middle
corner
of
these
will
be
called
the
vertex
of
the
square
and
the
corner
not
on
the
curve
will
be
called
the
diagonal
point
of
the
square
.
Each
point
on
C
,
as
a
vertex
,
may
possess
a
finite
number
of
corresponding
diagonal
points
by
the
above
construction
.
To
each
paired
vertex
and
diagonal
point
there
corresponds
a
unique
forward
corner
point
,
i.e.
,
the
corner
on
C
reached
first
by
proceeding
along
C
from
the
vertex
in
the
direction
of
increasing
t
.
If
the
vertex
is
at
**f
,
and
if
the
interior
of
C
is
on
the
left
as
one
moves
in
the
direction
of
increasing
t
,
then
every
such
corner
can
be
found
from
the
curve
obtained
by
rotating
C
clockwise
through
90
`
about
the
vertex
.
The
set
of
intersections
of
**f
,
the
rotated
curve
,
with
the
original
curve
C
consists_of
just
the
set
of
forward
corner
points
on
C
corresponding
to
the
vertex
at
**f
,
plus
the
vertex
itself
.
We
note
that
two
such
curves
C
and
**f
,
cannot
coincide
at
more_than
a
finite
number
of
points
;
otherwise
,
being
analytic
,
they
would
coincide
at
all
points
,
which
is
impossible
since
they
do
not
coincide
near
**f
.
With
each
vertex
we
associate
certain
numerical
values
,
namely
the
set
of
positive
differences
in
the
parameter
t
between
the
vertex
and
its
corresponding
forward
corner
points
.
For
the
vertex
at
**f
,
these
values
will
be
denoted
by
**f
.
The
function
f
(
t
)
defined
in
this
way
is
multi
valued
.
We
consider
now
the
graph
of
the
function
f
(
t
)
on
**f
.
We
will
refer
to
the
plane
of
C
and
**f
as
the
C-plane
and
to
the
plane
of
the
graph
as
the
f-plane
.
The
graph
,
as
a
set
,
may
have
a
finite
number
of
components
.
We
will
denote
the
values
of
f
(
t
)
on
different
components
by
**f
.
Each
point
with
abscissa
t
on
the
graph
represents
an
intersection
between
C
and
**f
.
There
are
two
types
of
such
intersections
,
depending
essentially
on
whether
the
curves
cross
at
the
point_of_intersection
.
An
ordinary
point
will
be
any
point_of_intersection
A
such_that
in
every
neighborhood
of
A
in
the
C-plane
,
**f
meets
both
the
interior
and
the
exterior
of
C
.
Any
other
point_of_intersection
between
C
and
**f
will
be
called
a
tangent
point
.
This
terminology
will
also
be
applied
to
the
corresponding
points
in
the
f-plane
.
We
can
now
prove
several
lemmas
.
In
some
neighborhood
in
the
f-plane
of
any
ordinary
point
of
the
graph
,
the
function
f
is
a
single
valued
,
continuous
function
.
We
first
show
that
the
function
is
single
valued
in
some
neighborhood
.
With
the
vertex
at
**f
in
the
C-plane
we
assume
that
**f
is
the
parametric
location
on
C
of
an
ordinary
intersection
Q
between
C
and
**f
.
In
the
f-plane
the
coordinates
of
the
corresponding
point
are
**f
.
We
know
that
in
the
C-plane
both
C
and
**f
are
analytic
.
In
the
C-plane
we
construct
a
set
of
rectangular
Cartesian
coordinates
u
,
v
with
the
origin
at
Q
and
such_that
both
C
and
**f
have
finite
slope
at
Q
.
Near
Q
,
both
curves
can
be
represented
by
analytic
functions
of
u
.
In
a
neighborhood
of
Q
the
difference
between
these
functions
is
also
a
single
valued
,
analytic
function
of
u
.
Furthermore
,
one
can
find
a
neighborhood
of
Q
in
which
the
difference
function
is
monotone
,
for
since
it
is
analytic
it
can
have
only
a
finite
number
of
extrema
in
any
interval
.
Now
,
to
find
**f
,
one
needs
the
intersection
of
C
and
**f
near
Q
.
But
**f
is
just
the
curve
**f
translated
without
rotation
through
a
small
arc
,
for
**f
is
always
obtained
by
rotating
C
through
exactly
90
`
.
The
arc
is
itself
a
segment
of
an
analytic
curve
.
Thus
if
e
is
sufficiently
small
,
there
can
be
only
one
intersection
of
C
and
**f
near
Q
,
for
if
there
were
more
than
one
intersection
for
every
e
then
the
difference
between
C
and
**f
near
Q
would
not
be
a
monotone
function
.
Therefore
,
**f
is
single
valued
near
Q
.
It
is
also
seen
that
**f
,
since
the
change
from
**f
to
**f
is
accomplished
by
a
continuous
translation
.
Thus
**f
is
also
continuous
at
**f
,
and
in
a
neighborhood
of
**f
which
does
not
contain
a
tangent
point
.
We
turn
now
to
the
set
of
tangent
points
on
the
graph
.
This
set
must
consist_of
isolated
points
and
closed_intervals
.
The
fact
that
there
can
not
be
any
limit_points
of
the
set
except
in
closed_intervals
follows
from
the
argument
used
in
Lemma
1
,
namely
,
that
near
any
tangent
point
in
the
C-plane
the
curves
C
and
**f
are
analytic
,
and
therefore
the
difference
between
them
must
be
a
monotone
function
in
some
neighborhood
on
either
side
of
the
tangent
point
.
This
prevents
the
occurrence
of
an
infinite
sequence
of
isolated
tangent
points
.
In
some
neighborhood
of
an
isolated
tangent
point
in
the
f-plane
,
say
**f
,
the
function
**f
is
either
double
valued
or
has
no
values
defined
,
except
at
the
tangent
point
itself
,
where
it
is
single
valued
.
A
tangent
point
Q
in
the
C-plane
occurs
when
C
and
**f
are
tangent
to
one
another
.
A
continuous
change
in
t
through
an
amount
e
results
in
a
translation
along
an
analytic
arc
of
the
curve
**f
.
There
are
three
possibilities
:
(
a
)
**f
remains
tangent
to
C
as
it
is
translated
;
(
b
)
**f
moves
away
from
C
and
does
not
intersect
it
at_all
for
**f
;
(
c
)
**f
cuts_across
C
and
there
are
two
ordinary
intersections
for
every
t
in
**f
.
The
first
possibility
results
in
a
closed_interval
of
tangent
points
in
the
f-plane
,
the
end_points
of
which
fall_into
category
(
b
)
or
(
c
)
.
In
the
second
category
the
function
**f
has
no
values
defined
in
a
neighborhood
**f
.
In
the
third
category
the
function
is
double
valued
in
this
interval
.
The
same
remarks
apply
to
an
interval
on
the
other
side
of
**f
.
Again
,
the
analyticity
of
the
two
curves
guarantee
that
such
intervals
exist
.
In
the
neighborhood
of
an
end_point
of
an
interval
of
tangent
points
in
the
f-plane
the
function
is
two
valued
or
no
valued
on
one
side
,
and
is
a
single
valued
function
consisting
entirely
of
tangent
points
on
the
other
side
.
With
the
above
results
we
can
make
the
following
remarks
about
the
graph
of
f
.
First
,
for
any
value
of
t
for
which
all
values
of
f
(
t
)
are
ordinary
points
the
number
of
values
of
f
(
t
)
must
be
odd
.
For
it
is
clear
that
the
total
number
of
ordinary
intersections
of
C
and
**f
must
be
even
(
otherwise
,
starting
in
the
interior
of
C
,
**f
could
not
finally
return
to
the
interior
)
,
and
the
center
of
rotation
at
t
is
the
argument
of
the
function
,
not
a
value
.
Therefore
,
for
any
value
of
t
the
number
of
values
of
f
(
t
)
is
equal
to
the
(
finite
)
number
of
tangent
points
corresponding
to
the
argument
t
plus
an
odd
number
.
The
number
of
ordinary
values
of
the
function
f
(
t
)
at
t
will
be
called
its
multiplicity
at
t
.
The
graph
of
f
has
at_least
one
component
whose
support
is
the
entire
interval
[
0
,
T
]
.
We
suppose
not
.
Then
every
component
of
the
graph
of
f
must
be
defined
over
a
bounded
sub-interval
.
Suppose
**f
is
defined
in
the
sub-interval
**f
.
Now
**f
and
**f
must
both
be
tangent
points
on
the
nth
component
in
the
f-plane
;
otherwise
by
Lemma
1
the
component
would
extend
beyond
these
points
.
Further
,
we
see
by
Lemma
2
that
the
multiplicity
of
f
can
only
change
at
a
tangent
point
,
and
at
such
a
point
can
only
change
by
an
even
integer
.
Thus
the
multiplicity
of
**f
for
a
given
t
must
be
an
even
number
.
This
is
true
of
all
components
which
have
such
a
bounded
support
.
But
this
is
a
contradiction
,
for
we
know
that
the
multiplicity
of
f
(
t
)
is
odd
for
every
t
.
We
have
shown
that
the
graph
of
f
contains
at_least
one
component
whose
inverse
is
the
entire
interval
[
0
,
T
]
,
and
whose
multiplicity
is
odd
.
There
must
be
an
odd
number
of
such
components
,
which
will
be
called
complete
components
.
The
remaining
(
incomplete
)
components
all
have
an
even
number
of
ordinary
points
at
any
argument
,
and
are
defined
only
on
a
proper
sub-interval
of
[
0
,
T
]
.
We
must
now
show
that
on
some
component
of
the
graph
there
exist
two
points
for
which
the
corresponding
diagonal
points
in
the
C-plane
are
on
opposite
sides
of
C
.
We
again
consider
a
fixed
point
P
at
**f
and
a
variable
point
Q
at
**f
on
C
.
We
erect
a
square
with
PQ
as
a
side
and
with
free
corners
**f
and
**f
adjacent
to
P
and
Q
respectively
.
As
s
varies
from
zero
to
T
,
the
values
of
s
for
which
**f
and
**f
cross
C
will
be
denoted
by
**f
and
**f
respectively
.
We
have
**f
,
plus
tangent
points
.
These
s-values
are
just
the
ordinary
values
of
**f
.
The
values
**f
are
the
ordinary
values
at
**f
of
a
multi
valued
function
g
(
t
)
which
has
components
corresponding
to
those
of
f
(
t
)
.
We
first
define
a
function
b
(
t
)
as_follows
:
given
the
set
of
squares
such_that
each
has
three
corners
on
C
and
vertex
at
t
,
b
(
t
)
is
the
corresponding
set
of
positive
parametric
differences
between
t
and
the
backward
corner
points
.
The
functions
f
and
b
have
exactly
the
same
multiplicity
at
every
argument
t
.
Now
with
P
fixed
at
**f
,
**f-values
occur
when
the
corner
**f
crosses
C
,
and
are
among
the
values
of
s
such_that
**f
.
The
roots
of
this
equation
are
just
the
ordinates
of
the
intersections
of
the
graph
of
b
with
a
straight_line
of
unit
slope
through
**f
in
the
b-plane
(
the
plane
of
the
graph
of
b
)
.
We
define
these
values
as
**f
,
and
define
g
(
t
)
in
the
same
way
for
each
t
.
Thus
we
obtain
g
(
t
)
by
introducing
an
oblique
g
(
t
)
-
axis
in
the
b-plane
.
