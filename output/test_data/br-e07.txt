The
design
of
a
mechanical
interlocking
frame
is
much
like
a
mechanical
puzzle
,
but
once
understood
,
the
principles
can
be
applied
to
any
track
and
signal
arrangement
.
In
the
frame
are
two
sets
of
bars
which
interact
with
each
other
to
prevent
the
operator
from
making
dangerous
moves
.
The
main
set
of
bars
are
the
``
tappets
''
and
one
tappet
is
connected
to
each
lever
.
If
the
lever
is
pulled
to
clear
a
signal
or
move
a
switch
,
the
tappet
moves
a
short
distance
lengthwise
at_the_same_time
.
Close
behind
the
plane
of
the
tappets
are
the
locking
bars
.
These
can
also
move
a
short
distance
but
at
right_angles
to
the
tappets
.
The
number
of
locking
bars
required
depends_on
how
many
false
moves
must
be
prevented
.
In
the
sides
of
the
tappets
are
notches
with
sloping
sides
,
and
connection
between
the
tappets
and
locking
bars
consist_of
cams
called
``
dogs
''
.
Two
or
more
dogs
are
mounted
on
each
locking
bar
.
These
slide
into
and
out
of
the
notches
in
the
tappets
as
the
tappets
are
moved
,
locking
and
unlocking
them
.
Here
's
how
the
scheme
works
:
Suppose
the
operator
pulls
the
lever
to
clear
a
particular
signal
.
This
also
pulls
the
tappet
connected
to
the
particular
lever
and
forces
any
dogs
seated
in
the
notches
to_the_side
,
thus
moving
one
or
more
locking
bars
.
The
dogs
on
the
other
ends
of
these
locking
bars
are
thus
forced
into
notches
in
other
tappets
.
By
this
scheme
,
pulling
one
signal
to
clear
locks
all
the
other
switch
and
signal
levers
in
safe
positions
until
the
first
signal
is
again
restored
to
normal
.
Interlocking
signals
are
normally
at
stop
or
``
red
''
position
,
and
a
lever
must
be
pulled
to
``
clear
''
the
signal
.
This
is
not
necessarily
to
green
,
however
,
for
in
some
situations
only
a
yellow
indication
is
given
to
a
train
to
let
it
into
the
``
plant
''
.
There
are
other
basic
rules
.
A
turnout
may
have
two
levers
,
one
to
actually
move
the
switch
points
,
the
other
to
lock
the
points
.
A
signal
cannot
be
cleared
until
all
the
related
turnouts
are
properly
thrown
and
locked
.
Such
locks
are
nearly
always
used
where
the
switch
points
``
face
''
oncoming
traffic
.
The
lock
insures
that
the
points
are
thrown
all_the_way
with
no
chance
that
a
wheel
flange
will
snag
on
a
partly
thrown
point
.
If
the
points
are
n't
thrown
all_the_way
,
the
turnout
cannot
be
locked
,
and
in_turn
,
the
signal
cannot
be
cleared
.
Generally
,
these
locks
on
turnouts
are_called
``
facing
point
locks
''
.
Figs.

show
typical
arrangements
of
track
and
signals
.
Each
diagram
is
accompanied
by
a
``
dog
chart
''
,
a
list
of
the
levers
that
show
which
other
levers
any
particular
lever
will
lock
if
pulled
.
The
lines
connecting
the
wedge-shaped
dogs
represent
the
locking
bars
at
right_angles
to
the
tappet
bars
.
By
studying
the
track-signal
diagrams
you
'll
note
several
other
details
.
Derails
-
mechanical
track
devices
that
actually
guide
the
wheels
off
the
rails
if
a
train
passes
a
``
stop
''
signal
-
are
used
in
many
instances
.
``
Home
''
signals
have
two
blades
.
The
blacked-in
blades
indicate
a
fixed
aspect
-
the
blade
does
not
move
.
As
an
engineer
approaches
the
plant
the
position
of
the
home
signal
is
seen
in_advance
when
he
passes
the
``
distant
''
signal
located
beyond
the
limits
of
the
interlocking
plant
.
In
some
low-speed
situations
,
the
distant
signal
is_fixed
at
caution
.
In
other
instances
where
there
is
no
automatic
block
signaling
,
the
distant
has
only
green
and
yellow
aspects
.
So_much
for
the
prototype
.
The
interlocking
frame
we
built
at
the
Model
Railroader
workshop
and_then
installed
on
Paul_Larson
's
railroad
follows
the
Fig.
1
scheme
and
is_shown
beginning
in
Fig.
7
,
page
65
,
and
in
the
photos
.
Here
's
how
it
can
be
built
.
The
sizes
of
pieces
needed
for
the
interlocking
frame
are_shown
in
the
notes
within
Fig.
7
,
most_of
the
bars
being
1
8
''
brass
in
1
4
''
and
1
2
''
widths
.
You
may
change
the
dimensions
to
suit
a
frame
for
more
or
fewer
levers
and
locks
as
you
wish
.
Our
instructions
assume
you
are
building
this
particular
frame
,
which
is
for
a
junction
.
When
cutting
the
pieces
,
dress
the
ends
smooth
,
and
square
with
a
smooth
file
or
sanding
disk
.
Start
with
the
right-hand
piece
``
B
''
,
*
*
f
,
soldering
it
to
the
lower
piece
``
A
''
of
the
same
material
but
12
''
long
.
Let
exactly
1
''
of
``
A
''
extend
beyond
``
B
''
and
use
a
square
to
check
your
angle
to
exactly
90
degrees
.
Now
lay
12
pieces
of
*
*
f
cut
5
-
3
4
''
long
side_by_side
but
separated
by
12
pieces
of
the
same
material
1
2
''
sq.
.
This
gives
you
the
spacing
for
locating
the
left-hand
piece
``
B
''
.
Compress
the
assembly
when
you
make
the
mark
to
show
the
location
for
``
B
''
.
Solder
this
second
``
B
''
to
``
A
''
at
right_angles
.
There
should
be
10
''
between
the
two
parallel
members
and
each
should
be
1
''
from
an
end
of
the
long
piece
.
Cap
this
assembly
(
with
spacing
bars
in_place
)
with
a
*
*
f
bar
.
Tack
solder
all
the
1
2
''
sq.
pieces
to
the
10
''
and
12
''
members
.
These
will
be
drilled
and
tapped
later_on
.
Now
cut
five
*
*
f
locking
bar
spacers
(
which
run
horizontally
)
.
Position
these
using
six
intermediate
temporary
*
*
f
spacers
and
locate
the
upper
12
''
bar
``
A
''
.
Solder
it
and
the
five
locking
bar
spacers
to
the
frame
.
Now
place
12
pieces
1
2
''
sq.
on
this
edge
as
we
did
before
and
space
them
with
the
5
-
3
4
''
long
``
tappets
''
,
as
they
are
called
.
Cap
with
a
*
*
f
bar
and
tack
solder
in_place
.
Cap
the
locking
bar
spacers
with
two
*
*
f
directly
under
the
first
two
``
B
''
pieces
.
Remove
all
the
loose
spacing
bars
.
Mark
and
center-punch
all
the
holes
required
for
screws
to
hold
this
assembly
together
.
See
Fig.
7
.
Placement
of
these
holes
is
not
critical
,
but
they
should
be
located
so_that
the
centers
are
about
1
8
''
from
any
edge
.
Drill
all
No.
50
and
counter-drill
all
except
the
``
A
''
pieces
size
43
.
Tap
the
``
A
''
pieces
2
-
56
.
Now
unsolder
and
disassemble
the
frame
except
for
the
two
12
''
and
the
first
two
3
-
3
4
''
bars
(
``
A
''
and
``
B
''
pieces
)
,
which
are
soldered
together
.
Either
lay
the
components
aside
in
proper
order
or
code
them
with
numbers
and
letters
so
they
may
be
replaced
in
their
proper
positions
.
Dress
all
surfaces
with
a
file
,
cleaning
off
all
solder
and
drilling
burrs
.
Drill
20
No.
47
holes
in
the
upper
piece
``
A
''
as
shown
in
Fig.
7
.
Tap
these
3
-
48
for
mounting
the
electrical_contact
later_on
.
Note
6
and
8
lock
levers
do
n't
require
holes
for
contacts
.
Now
reassemble
the
frame
,
using
*
*
f
roundhead
steel
screws
and
nuts
.
Put
the
12
tappets
and
some
*
*
f
locking
bar
spacers
in
the
frame
to
help
align
all
the
components
before
you
tighten
the
screws
.
Be
sure
the
tappets
are
not
pinched
by
a
twisted
1
2
''
sq.
spacer
.
As
an
anchor
for
the
spring
lock
,
insert
a
*
*
f
bar
in
the
lower
left
corner
of
the
frame
as
shown
in
Fig.
7
.
Drill
a
No.
43
hole
through
the
pieces
and
secure
with
a
2
-
56
nut
and
screw
.
Drill
two
No.
50
holes
,
one
in
the
insert
and
one
in
the
locking
bar
spacer
directly
above
it
,
and
tap
2
-
56
.
Number
all
the
tappet
bars
before
removing
them
so
they
can
be
replaced
in
the
same
slots
.
Remove
all
other
loose
pieces
and
file
the
edges
of
the
basic
frame
smooth
.
Cut
five
pieces
of
*
*
f
brass
bar
stock
3
-
3
4
''
long
.
These
are
supporting
members
for
the
short
locking
bars
.
Locate
their
positions
in
Fig.
7
and
drill
No.
43
to
match
the
corresponding
holes
in
the
frame
.
Cut_off
excess
screw
lengths
and
file
flush
with
either
frame
or
nut
.
Drill
four
No
.19
and
four
No.
28
holes
in
the
12
''
long
``
A
''
pieces
.
Locate
the
position
from
Fig.
7
.
Draw
file
No.
1
tappet
to
a
smooth
fit
in
its
respective
slot
and
square
the
ends
.
Break
the
end
corners
with
a
slight
45
degree
chamfer
.
Drill
a
No.
50
hole
1
-
1
4
''
from
one
end
and
tap
2
-
56
.
(
See
Fig.
7
.
)
Put
a
2
-
56
roundhead
screw
into
the
hole
,
cut_off
the
excess
threads
and
file
flush
with
the
underside
of
the
bar
.
To
find
the
other
stop
screw
position
,
insert
the
tappet
into
the
frame
and
hold
the
screw
head
tight
against
the
frame
edge
.
Scribe
a
line
across
the
bar
on
the
other
end
of
the
tappet
,
1
4
''
plus
half
the
diameter
of
the
2
-
56
screw
head
(
about
5
64
''
)
away
from
the
frame
edge
.
Total
distance
is
about
21
64
''
.
Tend
to
make
this
dimension
slightly
undersize
so
you
can
file
the
screw
head
to
get
exactly
1
4
''
tappet
movement
.
Drill
a
No.
50
hole
,
tap
2
-
56
and
insert
a
roundhead
2
-
56
screw
as
you
did
on
the
first
end
.
Drill
a
No.
47
hole
crosswise
through
the
tappet
at
the
position
shown
in
Figs.
7
and
8
.
Repeat
these
drill
and
tap
operations
for
each
of
the
tappet
bars
.
To
each
tappet
except
6
and
8
,
solder
a
*
*
f
piece
of
brass
and
file
to
the
tapered
shape
shown
in
Figs
.6
and
8
.
These
will
serve
as
lifting
pads
for
the
electrical_contacts
.
Fitting
the
locking
bars
and
making
the
locking
pieces
is
a
rather
tedious
job
since
stop
screws
,
tappets
and
locking
bars
must
be
removed
and
replaced
many_times
.
As
the
work
progresses
the
frame
and
moving
parts
become
a
sort_of
Chinese_puzzle
where
several
pieces
must
be
removed
before
the
part
you
are
working_on
is
accessible
.
A_little
extra
work
here
will
pay_off
with
a
smooth
,
snug-fitting
machine
when
you
are
finished
.
Each
completed
locking
bar
should
remain
in_place
as
the
work
progresses
to
insure
snug
fitting
.
The
order
of
fitting
is
not
too
important
.
However
,
we
started
with
the
first
row
of
bars
and
worked
our
way
back
.
Since
the
same
method
of
shaping
and
fitting
the
dogs
and
notches
is
used
throughout
,
we
will
only
describe
the
construction
of
one
locking
bar
.
Figs
.7
and
8
give
all
pertinent
dimensions
.
All
the
bars
are
cut
from

f
brass
.
The
lengths
of
each

are
listed
at
