Rookie
Ron_Nischwitz
continued
his
pinpoint
pitching
Monday
night
as
the
Bears
made_it
two
straight
over
Indianapolis
,
5
-
3
.
The
husky
6
-
3
,
205
-
pound
lefthander
,
was
in
command
all_the_way
before
an
on_the_scene
audience
of
only
949
and
countless
of
television
viewers
in
the
Denver
area
.
It
was
Nischwitz
'
third
straight
victory
of
the
new
season
and
ran
the
Grizzlies
'
winning
streak
to
four
straight
.
They
now
lead
Louisville
by
a
full
game
on
top
of
the
American_Association
pack
.
Nischwitz
fanned
six
and
walked
only
Charley_Hinton
in
the
third
inning
.
He
has
given
only
the
one
pass
in
his
27
innings
,
an
unusual
characteristic
for
a
southpaw
.
The
Bears
took
the
lead
in
the
first
inning
,
as
they
did
in
Sunday
's
opener
,
and
never
lagged
.
Dick_McAuliffe
cracked
the
first
of
his
two
doubles
against
Lefty
Don_Rudolph
to
open
the
Bear
's
attack
.
After
Al_Paschal
grounded_out
,
Jay_Cooke
walked
and
Jim_McDaniel
singled
home
McAuliffe
.
Alusik
then
moved
Cooke
across
with
a
line_drive
to
left
.
Jay_Porter
drew
a
base_on_balls
to
fill
the
bases
but
Don_Wert
's
smash
was
knocked_down
by
Rudolph
for
the
putout
.
The
Bears
added
two
more
in
the
fifth
when
McAuliffe
dropped
a
double
into
the
leftfield
corner
,
Paschal
doubled
down
the
rightfield
line
and
Cooke
singled
off
Phil_Shartzer
's
glove
.
Nischwitz
was
working_on
a
3_hitter
when
the
Indians
bunched
three
of
their
eight
hits
for
two
runs
in
the
sixth
.
Chuck_Hinton
tripled
to
the
rightfield
corner
,
Cliff_Cook
and
Dan_Pavletich
singled
and
Gaines
'
infielder
roller
accounted_for
the
tallies
.
The
Bears
added
their
last
run
in
the
sixth
on
Alusik
's
double
and
outfield
flies
by
Porter
and
Wert
.
Gaines
hammered
the
ball
over
the
left
fence
for
the
third
Indianapolis
run
in
the
ninth
.
Despite
the
45
-
degree
weather
the
game
was
clicked_off
in
1
:
48
,
thanks
to
only
three
bases_on_balls
and
some
good
infield
play
.
Chico_Ruiz
made
a
spectacular
play
on
Alusik
's
grounder
in
the
hole
in
the
fourth
and
Wert
came_up
with
some
good
stops
and
showed
a
strong
arm
at
third_base
.
Cliff_Cook
accounted_for
three
of
the
Tribe
's
eight
hits
.
It
was
the
season
's
first
night_game
and
an
obvious
refocusing
of
the
lights
are
in_order
.
The
infield
was
well
flooded
but
the
expanded
outfield
was
much
too
dark
.
Mary_Dobbs_Tuttle
was
back
at
the
organ
.
Among
the
spectators
was
the
noted
exotic_dancer
,
Patti_Waggin
who
is
Mrs._Don_Rudolph
when
off
the
stage
.
Lefty
Wyman_Carey
,
another
Denver
rookie
,
will
be
on
the
mound
against
veteran
John_Tsitouris
at
8
o'clock
Tuesday
night
.
Ed_Donnelly
is
still
bothered
by
a
side
injury
and
will
miss
his
starting
turn
.
Kenny_Lane
of
Muskegon
,
Mich.
,
world
's
seventh
ranked
lightweight
,
had
little
trouble
in
taking
a
unanimous
decision
over
Rip_Randall
of
Tyler
,
Tex.
,
here
Monday
night
.
Billy_Gardner
's
line_double
,
which
just
eluded
the
diving
Minnie_Minoso
in
left_field
,
drove_in
Jim_Lemon
with
the
winning
run
with
two
out
in
the
last
of
the
ninth
to
give
the
Minnesota_Twins
a
6
-
5
victory
over
the
Chicago_White_Sox
Monday
.
Lemon
was
on
with
his
fourth
single
of
the
game
,
a
liner
to
center
.
He
came
all_the_way
around
on
Gardner
's
hit
before
5777
fans
.
It
was
Gardner
's
second
run_batted_in
of
the
game
and
his
only
ones
of
the
year
.
Turk_Lown
was
tagged
with
the
loss
,
his
second
against
no
victories
,
while
Ray_Moore
won
his
second
game
against
a
single
loss
.
The
Twins
tied
the
score
in
the
sixth
inning
when
Reno_Bertoia
beat_out
a
high
chopper
to
third_base
and
scored
on
Lenny_Green
's
double
to
left
.
The
White_Sox
had
taken
a
5
-
4
lead
in
the
top
of
the
sixth
on
a
pair
of
pop_fly
hits
-
a
triple
by
Roy_Sievers
and
single
by
Camilo_Carreon
-
a
walk
and
a
sacrifice_fly
.
Jim_Landis
'
380
-
foot
home_run
over
left
in
the
first
inning
gave
the
Sox
a
1
-
0
lead
,
but
Harmon_Killebrew
came_back
in
the
bottom
of
the
first
with
his
second
homer
in
two
days
with
the
walking
Bob_Allison
aboard
.
Al_Smith
's
340
-
blast
over
left
in
the
fourth
-
his
fourth
homer
of
the
campaign
-
tied
the
score
and
Carreon
's
first
major_league
home_run
in
the
fifth
put
the
Sox
back
in_front
.
A
double
by
Green
,
Allison
's
run
scoring
2_baser
,
an
infield
single
by
Lemon
and
Gardner
's
solid
single
to
center
put
the
Twins
back
in_front
in
the
last
of
the
fifth
.
Boston_Red_Sox
Outfielder
Jackie_Jensen
said
Monday
night
he
was
through
playing
baseball
.
``
I
've
had
it
''
,
he
told
a
newsman
.
``
I
know
when
my
reflexes
are
gone
and
I'm
not
going_to
be
any
25th
man
on
the
ball_club
''
.
This
was
the
first
word
from
Jensen
on
his
sudden
walkout
.
Jensen
got
only
six
hits
in
46
at-bats
for
a
.130
batting
average
in
the
first
12
games
.
He
took
a
midnight
train
out
of
Cleveland
Saturday
,
without
an
official
word
to
anybody
,
and
has
stayed
away
from
newsmen
on
his
train
trip
across_the_nation
to
Reno
,
Nev.
,
where
his
wife
,
former
Olympic
Diving
Champion
Zoe_Ann_Olsen
,
awaited
.
She
said
,
when
she
learned
Jackie
was
heading_home
:
``
I'm
just
speculating
,
but
I
have_to
think
Jack
feels
he
's
hurting
Boston
's
chances
''
.
The
Union_Pacific_Railroad
streamliner
,
City_of_San_Francisco
,
stopped
in
Ogden
,
Utah
,
for
a_few
minutes
.
Sports_Writer
Ensign_Ritchie
of
the
Ogden_Standard_Examiner
went_to
his
compartment
to
talk
with
him
.
The
conductor
said
to
Ritchie
:
``
I
do
n't
think
you
want
to
talk
to
him
.
You
'll
probably
get
a
ball
bat
on
the
head
.
He
's
mad
at
the
world
''
.
But
Jackie
had
gone_into
the
station
.
Ritchie
walked
up
to
him
at
the
magazine
stand
.
``
I
told
him
who
I
was
and
he
was
quite
cold
.
But
he
warmed_up
after
a
while
.
I
told
him
what
Liston
had
said
and
he
said
Liston
was
a
double-crosser
and
said
anything
he
(
Liston
)
got
was
through
a
keyhole
.
He
said
he
had
never
talked
to
Liston
''
.
Liston
is
Bill_Liston
,
baseball
writer
for
the
Boston_Traveler
,
who
quoted
Jensen
as
saying
:
``
I
can't
hit
anymore
.
I
can't
run
.
I
can't
throw
.
Suddenly
my
reflexes
are
gone
.
Just
when
it
seems
baseball
might
be
losing
its
grip
on
the
masses
up
pops
heroics
to
start
millions
of
tongues
to
wagging
.
And
so
it
was
over
the
weekend
what
with
40
-
year
old
Warren_Spahn
pitching
his
no-hit
masterpiece
against
the
Giants
and
the
Giants
'
Willie_Mays
retaliating
with
a
record
tying
4
-
homer
spree
Sunday
.
Both
,
of_course
,
were
remarkable
feats
and
further
embossed
the
fact
that
baseball
rightfully
is
the
national
pastime
.
Of
the
two
cherished
achievements
the
elderly
Spahn
's
hitless
pitching
probably
reached
the
most
hearts
.
It
was
a
real
stimulant
to
a_lot
of
guys
I
know
who
have
moved
past
the
2
-
score
year
milestone
.
And
one
of
the
Milwaukee
rookies
sighed
and
remarked
,
``
Wish
I
was
40
,
and
a
top
grade
big_leaguer
.
THE
MODEST
AND
HAPPY
Spahn
waved_off
his
new
laurels
as
one
of
those
good
days
.
But
there
surely
can
be
no_doubt
about
the
slender
southpaw
belonging
with
the
all_time
great
lefthanders
in
the
game
's
history
.
Yes
,
with
Bob_Grove
,
Carl_Hubbell
,
Herb_Pennock
,
Art_Nehf
,
Vernon_Gomez
,
et_al
.
Spahn
not_only
is
a
superior
pitcher
but
a
gentlemanly
fine
fellow
,
a
ball_player
's
ball_player
,
as
they
say
in
the
trade
.
I
remember
his
beardown
performance
in
a
meaningless
exhibition_game
at
Bears_Stadium
Oct.
14
,
1951
,
before
a
new
record
crowd
for
the
period
of
18792
.
``
Spahnie
does
n't
know
how
to
merely
go_through_the_motions
''
,
remarked
Enos_Slaughter
,
another
all-out
guy
,
who
played
rightfield
that
day
and
popped
one
over
the
clubhouse
.
The
spectacular
Mays
,
who
reaches
a
decade
in
the
big_leagues
come
May
25
,
joined
six
other
sluggers
who
walloped
four
home_runs
in
a
span
of
nine
innings
.
Incidentally
,
only
two
did
it
before
a
home
audience
.
Bobby_Lowe
of
Boston
was
the
first
to
hit
four
at
home
and
Gil_Hodges
turned_the_trick
in
Brooklyn
's
Ebbetts_Field
.
Ed_Delahanty
and
Chuck_Klein
of
the
Phillies
,
the
Braves
'
Joe_Adcock
,
Lou_Gehrig
of
the
Yankees
,
Pat_Seerey
of
the
White_Sox
and
Rocky_Colavito
,
then
with
Cleveland
,
made
their
history
on_the_road
.
Willie
's
big
day
revived
the
running
argument
about
the
relative
merits
of
Mays
and
Mickey_Mantle
.
This
is
an
issue
which
boils_down
to
a
matter
of
opinion
,
depending_on
whether
you
're
an
American
or
National
fan
and
anti
or
pro
Yankee
.
The
record_books
,
however
,
would
favor
the
Giants
'
ace
.
In
four
of
his
nine
previous
seasons
Mays
hit
as_many_as
25
home_runs
and
stole
as_many_as
25
bases
.
Once
the
figure
was
30
-
30
.
Willie
's
lifetime
batting
average
of
.318
is
11
points
beyond
Mickey's
.
The
Giants
who
had
been
anemic
with
the
bat
in
their
windy
Candlestick_Park
suddenly
found
the
formula
in
Milwaukee
's
park
.
It
will
forever
be
a
baseball
mystery
how
a
team
will
suddenly
start
hitting
after
a
distressing
slump
.
THE
DENVER-AREA
TV_audience
was
privileged
to
see
Mays
'
four
home_runs
,
thanks
to
a
new
arrangement
made
by
Bob_Howsam
that
the
games
are
not
to
be
blacked_out
when
his
Bears
are
playing
at_home
.
This
rule
providing_for
a
blackout
of
televised
baseball
30_minutes
before
the
start
of
a
major
or
minor_league
game
in
any
area
comes
from
the
game
's
top
rulers
.
The
last
couple
of
years
the
Bears
management
got_the_business
from
the
``
Living_Room_Athletic_Club
''
when
games
were
cut_off
.
Actually
they
were
helpless
to
do
anything
about
the
nationwide
policy
.
This
year
,
I
am
told
,
the
CBS
network
will
continue
to
abide_by
the
rule
but
NBC
will
play
to
a
conclusion
here
.
There
are
two
more
Sunday
afternoons
when
the
situation
will
arise
.
It
is
an
irritable
rule
that
does
baseball
more
harm
than
good
,
especially
at
the
minor_league
level
.
You
would
be
surprised
how
many
fans
purposely
stayed
away
from
Bears_Stadium
last
year
because
of
the
television
policy
.
This
dissatisfaction
led
to
Howsam
's
request
that
the
video
not
be
terminated
before
the
end
of
the
game
.
The
powerful
New_York
Yankees
won
their
19th
world_series
in
a
5
-
game
romp
over
outclassed
Cincinnati
,
crushing
the
Reds
in
a
humiliating
13
-
5
barrage
Monday
in
the
loosely
played
finale
.
With
Mickey_Mantle
and
Yogi_Berra
both
out_of_action
due_to
injuries
,
the
American_League
champs
still
mounted
a
15
-
hit
attack
against
a
parade
of
eight
Cincinnati
pitchers
,
the
most
ever
used
by
one
team
in
a
series
game
.
Johnny_Blanchard
,
Mantle
's
replacement
,
slammed
a
2
-
run
homer
as
the
Yankees
routed
loser
Joey_Jay
in
a
5
-
run
first
inning
.
Hector_Lopez
,
subbing
for
Berra
,
smashed
a
3
-
run
homer
off
Bill_Henry
during
another
5
-
run
explosion
in
the
fourth
.
The
Yanks
also
took
advantage
of
three
Cincinnati
errors
.
The
crowd
of
32589
had
only
two
chances
to
applaud
.
In
the
third
Frank_Robinson
hammered
a
long
home_run
deep
into
the
corner
of
the
bleachers
in
right
center
,
about
400
feet
away
,
with
two
men
on
.
Momentarily
the
Reds
were
back
in
the
ball_game
,
trailing
only
6
-
3
,
but
the
drive
fizzled
when
John_Edwards
fouled_out
with
men
on
second
and
third
and
two
out
.
In
the
fifth
,
Wally_Post
slashed
a
2
-
run
homer
off
Bud_Daley
,
but
by
that
time
the
score
was
11
-
5
and
it
really
did
n't
matter
.
The
Yankee
triumph
made
Ralph_Houk
only
the
third
man
to
lead
a
team
to
both
a
pennant
and
a
World_Series
victory
in
his
first
year
as
a
manager
.
Only
Bucky_Harris
,
the
``
boy
manager
''
of
Washington
in
1924
,
and
Eddie_Dyer
of
the
St._Louis
Cardinals
in
1946
had
accomplished
the
feat
.
