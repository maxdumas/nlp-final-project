People
came
in
and
out
all
evening
to
see
the
baby
and
hold
it
.
The
room
filled
with
smoke
,
and
Maggie
's
head
throbbed
with_excitement
and
fatigue
,
but
Stuart
had
such
a
happy
,
earnest
look
of
proud
possession
on
his
face
that
Maggie
could
n't
bear
to
do
anything
to
quench
it
.
Little_Anne
rapidly
outdistanced
her
mother
in
recovery
.
In
two
months
she
became
a
fat
highly
social
baby
,
with
a
fuzz
of
flaxen
hair
all_over
her
head
.
She
stopped
flying
into
rages
and
started
digesting
her
food
;
she
developed
a
peaches
and
cream
complexion
and
a
sunny
disposition
,
and
she
asked
for
nothing
more
of
life
than
that
she
be
kept
dry
and
comfortable
and
fed
huge
amounts
of
food
at
stated
intervals
and
be
carried
to
where
she
could
watch
activity
going_on
around
her
.
She
was
so
heavy
that
Maggie
's
arms
shook
from
lifting
her
and
taking
care
of
her
.
Maggie
could
n't
seem
to
get
her
strength
back
or
catch_up_with
herself
with
all
she
had
to
do
:
there
was
the
big
basket
of
clothes
to
be
coaxed
through
the
rackety
old
washer
and
lugged
out
and
lugged
back
;
there
was
the
daily
round
of
household
chores
in_which
Maggie
insisted
on
participating
.
Worry
had
a
great_deal
to
do
with_it
;
Stuart
had
been
laid_off
at
the
produce
company
and
had
to
go_back
to
sitting
in
his
father
's
office
,
taking
what
salary
his
father
could
hand_out
to
him
.
Mr._Clifton
would
have
preferred
death
and
bankruptcy
to
having
his
son
stay
with
his
wife
's
people
without
contributing
to
his
and
his
family
's
upkeep
,
and
besides
that
there
were
the
things
that
had
to
be
bought
for
the
baby
,
milk
and
orange_juice
and
vitamins
and
soap
,
just
plain
soap
.
Maggie
and
Stuart
pored
over
figures
every_night
,
trying
to
find
how
they
could
squeeze_out
a_few
pennies
more
.
In
desperation
Maggie
consulted
Eugenia
one
afternoon
:
``
Do
you
think
you
could
find
me
something
I
could
do
here
at_home
to
make
some
money
,
so
I
could
still
watch
the
baby
and
do
the
rest
of
the
things
''
?
``
It
seems
to
me
you
have
enough
to
do
as_it_is
''
,
Eugenia
said
.
She
had
been
watching
Maggie
go
from
the
washing_machine
to
the
baby
to
the
stove
and
back
again
.
``
I
have
plenty
of
odd
moments
when
I
could
be
doing
something
''
,
Maggie
said
.
``
It
would
make
me
feel
a_lot
better
,
but
the
Woman
's
Exchange
is
n't
taking
baked_goods
any_more
and
I
can
n't
leave
the
baby
with
Grandma
because
she
is
n't
strong
enough
and
the
baby
's
too
young
to
be
put
in
a
nursery
''
.
``
I
should
think
so
''
,
Eugenia
said
.
``
For_one_thing
you
can
stop
keeping
that
child
in
starched
dresses
and
changed
from
the
skin
out
nineteen
times
a
day
''
.
``
She
's
so
beautiful
,
and
I
do
like
to
keep
her
looking
nice
''
.
Maggie
said
.
She
picked_up
the
baby
and
nuzzled
her
fat
warm
little
neck
.
``
She
'll
be
just_as
beautiful
in
something
that
does
n't
have
to
be
ironed
''
,
Eugenia
said
.
``
Evadna_Mae_Evans
said
she
did
n't
put
a
thing
on
her
child
but
a
flannel
wrapper
until
it
was
nine
months
old
''
.
``
Evadna_Mae_Evans
got
all
her
baby
clothes
from
Best
's
Liliputian_Bazaar
in
New_York
,
and
I
'm
sick
and
tired_of
hearing
about
Evadna_Mae_Evans
''
.
``
Well
now
,
Maggie
,
you
do
n't
have
to
snap
at
me
''
,
Eugenia
said
.
``
I
'm
just
thinking_of
a
way
for
you
to
be
sensible
''
.
``
I
'm
sorry
.
I
do
seem
to
snap
at
everybody
these
days
,
but
I
would
like
to
think_of
a
way
to
make
a_little
extra
money
''
.
``
Well
,
let
's
see
.
Let
's
make
a
list
of
your
assets
''
.
Maggie
started
laughing
,
and
she
laughed
so
hard
she
could
n't
stop
,
and
she
kept_on
laughing
while
she
lugged
the
clothes
out
to
the
yard
to
hang
them
up
while
the
sun
was
still
shining
.
When
she
came_back
Eugenia
was
sitting
at
the
kitchen_table
with
a
pencil
and
envelope
jotting_down
words
and
figures
.
``
I
have
here
that
you
could
run
a
nursery
of
your
own
for
working
mothers
''
,
Eugenia
said
.
``
We
could
put_up
cribs
on
the
second
floor
sleeping
porch
and
turn
the
front
bedroom
into
a
playroom
where
it
's
nice
and
sunny
,
but
of_course
it
would
entail
quite
a_bit
of
running
up
and
down
stairs
and
Chris
said
you
were
to
be
careful
about
that
''
.
``
What
else
''
?
``
You
might
set_up
a
dress_shop
in
the
living_room
''
.
``
Every
woman
in
the
block
has
tried
that
''
.
``
What
about
a
tea_room
,
then
?
You
could
set_up
tables
in
the
front_room
and
serve
salads
and
your
baked
beans
and
brown_bread
and
Grandma
could
dress
like
a
gypsy
and
tell
fortunes
''
.
``
It
's
too
elaborate
.
And
Grandma
is
n't
strong
enough
to
take_on
something
like
that
,
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
neither
am
I
''
.
Eugenia
sighed
.
She
said
,
``
Well
,
those
are
the
really
interesting
things
,
but
if
you
do
n't
like
any
of
those
I
can
turn_over
some
of
my
extra
typing
jobs
to
you
,
if
you
think
you
can
type
well
enough
''
.
``
Oh
,
I
'm
sure
I
could
do
that
''
,
Maggie
said
.
``
But
it
really
would
n't
be
fair
,
taking
your
jobs
away
from
you
''
.
``
Do
n't
worry
,
I
can
get
plenty
more
''
,
Eugenia
said
,
wondering
where
in
the
world
she
could
.
Maggie
was
looking
much
happier
already
,
clearing
a
space
on
the
table
and
chattering
about
how
she
could
put_up
a
typewriter
right_there
,
and
be
brushing_up
on
her
typing
so
Eugenia
would
n't
be
ashamed
of_it
.
``
And_then
whenever
I
have
a
minute
I
can
be
working_at
it
,
and
keep_an_eye_on
the
baby
and
the
stove
at_the_same_time
.
And
I
can
go_back
to
my
contests
and
be
thinking
while
I
'm
doing
the
washing
''
.
``
What
are
you
going_to
do
with
your
feet
so
you
do
n't
waste
anything
''
?
Maggie
laughed
.
She
said
,
``
Oh
Eugenia
,
I
wish
&
&
&
''
.
``
What
''
?
``
I
wish
I
had
three
wishes
''
,
Maggie
said
.
``
All_of
them
for
you
''
.
It
grew
bitterly
cold
toward
the
end
of
November
,
contributing
to
the
miseries
of
countless
numbers
of
people
.
The
temperature
dropped
to
twenty
below
at
night
and
stood
at
zero
during
the
days
.
The
cold
settled
like
a
tangible
pall
over
the
Mile_High_City
,
locking
it
in
an
icy
grip
that
harshened
its
outlines
and
altered
its
physical
appearance
;
it
had
a
look
of
grim
stark
realism
,
resembling
other
cities
whose
habitual
climate
was
cold
,
instead
of
the
sprawling
bumptious
open-handed
greedy
Western
city
basking
in
eternal
sunshine
at
the
foot
of
mountains
stored
with
endless
riches
and
resources
.
The
jobless
huddled
in
the
streets
outside
of
employment
offices
,
outside
newspaper
buildings
,
in
parks
,
in
relief
lines
,
outside
government
agencies
.
There
were
n't
facilities
to
take_care
of
them
;
there
never
had
been
a
need
felt
for
such
facilities
.
That
kind_of
poverty
was
regarded_as
the
exclusive
property
of
the
East
,
which
created
depressions
with
their
stock_markets
and
their
congested
populations
and
their
greedy
centralization
of
industries
,
protected
by
discriminatory
freight_rates
.
The
East
was
popularly
supposed
to
have
got
the
country
into
war
and
into
depression
,
dragging
the
west
along
;
and
now
the
East
was
creating
government
agencies
for
which
the
West
doubtless
would
have
to
pay
.
The
government_offices
were
being
opened
but
they
were
n't
being
opened
fast
enough
and
meanwhile
the
cold
penetrated
everything
.
Shivering
,
people
talked
and
argued
;
all
this
government
spending
would
have
to
be
paid
for
somehow
,
but
on_the_other_hand
desperate
circumstances
called_for
desperate
remedies
and
something
had
to
be
done
.
Something
had
to
be
done
;
it
was
the
theme_song
of
millions
of
American
people
,
their
personal
problems
no
less
urgent
than
those
of
the
government
.
Something
had
to
be
done
.
The
Abernathys
said
it
to
each
other
a
dozen
times
a
day
.
Something
had
to
be
done
about
the
furnace
,
the
fuel
bills
,
the
washing_machine
,
the
doctor
and
dentist
bills
,
about
making
money
stretch
for
food
,
for
the
mortgage
,
for
taxes
,
for
shoes
,
for
half_soles
,
for
overshoes
,
for
clothes
,
for
the
new
leaks
in
the
roof
,
for
gas
and
light
bills
;
about
keeping
warm
,
about
keeping
well
,
about
meeting
the
minor
emergencies
that
came_up
once
,
twice
,
fifty
times
a
day
.
Just
dropping
the
baby
's
bottle
and
breaking
it
became
a
catastrophe
,
and
Stuart
wore_out
his
shoes
so
fast
that
he
was
termed
a
major
disaster
.
The
Abernathy
furnace
consumed
fuel
like
a
giant
ravenous
maw
that
had
to
be
appeased
by
hurling
tons
of
coal
into
its
evil
red
depths
,
and
no_matter_how
much
coal
they
put_in
the
house
remained
cold
.
Cold
came_in
the
innumerable
cracks
that
seemed
to
have
sprung_up
,
under
doors
,
around
loosened
window_frames
,
from
the
sleeping
porches
,
the
attic
,
from
the
widened
cracks
between
shingles
on
the
roof
.
Presently
they
had
to
give_up
running
the
furnace
at
full
capacity
and
depend_on
the
old
coal
range
in
the
kitchen
,
which
had
never
been
removed
when
the
new
gas_range
was
installed
,
and
the
fireplaces
and
an
electric_heater
in
Grandma
's
room
.
It
was
so
cold
and
so
wretched
that
a
sort_of
desperate
gaiety
infected
all_of
them
,
like
people
stormbound
or
shipwrecked
or
caught
in
some
other
freak
of
circumstance
so_that
time
stood_still
and
minor
anxieties
fell_away
and
the
only
important
thing
was
to
cling
together
and
survive
.
The
pipes
burst
and
they
all
laughed
and
stood
in
ice_water
to
their
ankles
while
they
swabbed
the
bathrooms
.
They
lived
mainly
in
the
kitchen
;
they
moved
Maggie
's
bed
and
the
baby
's
basket
there
,
and
the
rest
of
them
undressed
by
the
stove
and
ran
groaning
and
shivering
to
the
upper
polar
regions
and
plunged
into
icy
beds
.
Grandma
said
it
was
just
like
the
early
mining
camp
days
,
and
it
was
the
way
people
ought
to
live
,
only
she
was
getting
too
old
to
take
the
pleasure
from_it
that
she
used_to
.
``
You
said
a
mouthful
''
,
Eugenia
said
grimly
.
Eugenia
hated
being
cold
worse
than
anything
,
and
she
was
beginning
to
find
the
joys
of
poverty
wearing_thin
.
She
said
to
Maggie
that
it
was
one
thing
to
meet
an
emergency
and
another
to
wallow
in
it
,
and
it
was
beginning
to
look
at
if
this
one
was
going_to
last
forever
.
``
Plenty
of
people
are
poor
all
their
lives
''
.
``
Plenty
of
people
have
n't
our
brains
and
talent
''
.
``
I
know
you
when
you
start
talking_about
brains
and
talent
''
,
Maggie
said
.
``
You
're
working_up
to
something
,
and
if
you
do
n't
watch_out
you
'll
ruin
your
whole
life
one_of_these_days
just
to
prove
that
the
Abernathy
family
is
superior
to
everything
,
even
a
depression
''
.
``
The
only
thing
that
worries
me
is
how
I
'm
going_to
prove
it
''
,
Eugenia
said
.
They
begged
Grandma
to
let
them
put
a
bed
in
the
kitchen
for
her
,
but
Grandma
said
she
was
getting
too
old
to
sleep
in
strange
beds
and
be
seen
with
her
teeth
out
,
and
that
she
hoped
to
die
in
privacy
like
a
Christian
and
if
the
Lord
willed
it
to
be
of
pneumonia
than
it
would
have
to
be
that
way
.
She
did
n't
want
to
be
the
only
one
with
a
stove
in
her
room
,
especially
as
her
life
span
was
nearly
run_out
anyway
,
and
she
insisted
that
Hope
have
the
heater
.
Hope
would
n't
hear
of
it
,
and
she
took
the
heater
back
to
Grandma
's
room
,
and
Grandma
took
it
back
to
Hope
's
room
,
and
the
two
of
them
dragged
it
back_and_forth
until
Grandma
tipped
it
over
and
almost
set
her
bedspread
on_fire
.
She
said
that
proved
she
was
n't
to
be
trusted
with
a
fire
in
her
room
,
and
she
could
be
burned
to
a
crisp
without
anybody
knowing
it
.
Eugenia
suspected
her
of
deliberately
overturning
the
heater
because
she
was
getting
tired
of
dragging
it
back_and_forth
and
still
wanted
her
own
way
,
but
Hope
said
if
Grandma
would
n't
have
the
heater
nobody
would
have
it
,
so
Grandma
had
to
give_in
.
