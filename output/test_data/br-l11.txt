``
Right
''
,
said
the
fingerprint_man
.
``
Also
,
if
you
're
going_to
believe
those
prints
,
you
'll
have
to
look_for
a
killer
who
's
a
top-grade
piano_player
''
.
He
demonstrated
by
playing
an
imaginary
piano
,
doing
a
staccato
passage
with
a
broadly
exaggerated
attack
.
To
make
it
clearer
he
shifted
to
acting_out
,
but
with
no
change
of
manner
,
the
killing
of
Rose_Mallory
.
His
hands
snatched
at
an
imaginary
bucket
,
swooping
down
hard
to
grab
it
and
coming_away
with
equal
snap
like
a
ball
that
's
been
bounced
hard
.
In
the
same
way
he
pantomimed
grasping
a
mantel
and
bouncing
cleanly
off
that
,
pressing
his
hands
against
the
floor
and
bouncing
cleanly
off
that
.
He
was
moving
like
a
ballet_dancer
,
playing
for
laughs
.
If
Rose_Mallory
's
killer
acted
this
way
,
catching_up_with
him
was
going_to
be
a
cinch
.
We
'd
know
him
by
his
stretch_pants
and
the
flowers
he
'd
wear
twined
in
his
hair
.
Perhaps
if
Felix
had
first
come_upon
us
when
this
boy
was
not
cavorting
so
gaily
up_and_down
the
hall
outside
the
murdered
woman
's
apartment
,
we
might
have
had
less
trouble
convincing
Felix
of
our
seriousness
.
This
,
you
will
remember
,
was
still
New_Year's_Day
.
By
the
time
Felix
turned_up
it
was
early
afternoon
,
which
,
one
would
think
,
would
be
late
enough
so
that
by
then
,
except
for
small
children
and
a_few
hardy
souls
who
had
not_yet
sobered_up
,
it
could
have
been
expected
that
people
would
no_longer
be
having
any
sort
of
active
interest
in
the
previous
night
's
noisemakers
and
paper
hats
.
Felix
was
the
exception
.
He
had
retained
his
hat
and
his
horn
,
and
,
whatever
fun
might
still
be
going
,
he
was
ready
to
join
it
.
That
,
incidentally
,
might
give
you
some
idea
of
what
Felix
was
like
.
After_all
,
he
had
n't
happened_upon
us
in_that
second
floor
hall
without
warning
.
The
ME
's
boys
had
finished
their
on-the-spot
examination
and
the
body
had
been
removed
for
autopsy
.
The
meat
wagon
,
therefore
,
was
not
out
in_front
of
the
house
any_more
,
but
the
cluster
of
squad_cars
was
still
there
and
there
was
a
cop
on
the
door
downstairs
to
screen
any
comings
and
goings
.
There
was
,
furthermore
,
the
crowd
of
curious
onlookers
gathered
in
the
street
and
a
couple
more
cops
to
hold
them
at
a
decent
distance
.
Just
put
yourself
in
Felix
's
place
for
a
moment
.
You
're
a
taxpayer
,
householder
,
landlord
.
You
've
been
away
from
home
for
the
New_Year
festivities
,
but
now
the
party
is
over
and
you
come
home
.
Defining
sobriety
in
the
limited
sense
of
being
free
from
the
clinical
symptoms
of
the
effects
of
alcohol
ingested
and
not_yet
eliminated
from
the
system
,
you
are
sober
.
You
still
have
your
paper
hat
and
you
're
wearing
it
,
but
then
,
it
is
an
extraordinary
paper
hat
and
,
in_addition
to
anything
else
you
may
be
,
you
are
also
the
sculptor
who
created
that
most
peculiar
dame
out
in
the
back_yard
.
It
's
not
too_much
to
assume
that
you
will
have
a
more
lasting
interest
in
paper
hats
than
will
Mr._Average_Citizen
.
You
have
your
paper
horn
clutched
in
your
big
,
craggy
fist
,
and
for
your
entrance
you
have
planned
a
noisy
,
colorful
and
exuberant
greeting
to
your
friends
and
tenants
.
You
find
your
house
a
focus
of
public
and
police
attention
.
Can
you
imagine
yourself
forgetting
under_the_circumstances
that
you
are
approaching
this
startling
and
unexpected
situation
so
unsuitably
hatted
and
armed
with
a
paper
horn
?
Maybe
one
could
be
startled
into
forgetfulness
.
You
shoulder
your
way
through
the
cluster
of
the
curious
and
you
barge
up
to
the
cop
on
the
door
.
You
identify
yourself
and
ask
him
what
's
going_on
.
Instead
of
answering
you
,
he
sticks
his
head
in
the
door
and
shouts
up_the_stairs
.
``
Got
the
upstairs
guy
''
,
he
bellows
.
``
The
owner
.
Do
I
send
him
up
''
?
Then
he
turns_back
to
you
.
``
Go_on
in
''
,
he
says
.
``
They
'll
tell
you
what
's
cooking
''
.
Even
then
,
as
you
go_into
the
house
oppressed
by
the
knowledge
that
something_is_cooking
and
that
your
house
has
passed
under
this
unaccountable
,
official
control
,
could
you
go_on
forgetting
that
you
still
had
that
ridiculous
hat
on
your
head
and
you
were
still
carrying
that
childish
horn
in
your
hand
?
What
I'm
getting
at
is
that
we
were
fully
prepared
for
Felix
's
being
an
odd
one
.
We
'd
seen
his
handiwork
out
in
the
back_yard
,
and
the
little
his
tenants
had
told
us
of
him
did
make
him
sound
a_little
special
.
We
were
not
,
however
,
prepared_for
anything
like
the
apparition
that
confronted
us
as
Felix
came_up
the
stairs
.
He
,
of_course
,
must
have
been
equally
unprepared
for
what
confronted
him
,
but
,
nonetheless
,
I
did
find
his
reaction
startling
.
If
Felix
was
still
wearing
the
hat
and
carrying
the
horn
because
he
'd
forgotten
about
them
,
he
now
remembered
.
He
came
bounding
up_the_stairs
and
joined
the
dance
.
He
adjusted
the
hat
,
lifted
the
horn
to
his
lips
as_though
it
were
a
flute
,
and
fell_in
alongside
our
fingerprint_expert
to
cavort
with
him
.
Our
man
stopped_dead
and
glowered
at
Felix
.
Felix
threw
his
head
back
and
laughed
a
laugh
that
shook
the
timbers
of
even
that
solidly
built
old
house
.
This
was
a
bull
of
a
man
.
He
was
big_chested
,
big-shouldered
and
heavy-armed
.
His
face
was
ruddy
and
heavy
and
unlined
,
and
when
he
laughed
he
showed
his
teeth
,
which
were
big
and
white
and
strong
and
unquestionably
home-grown
.
I
do
n't
remember
ever
seeing
teeth
that
were
quite
so
white
and
at_the_same_time
quite
so
emphatically
not
dentures
.
His
hair
had
receded
most
of
the
way
to
the
back
of
his
neck
.
He
had
only
a
fringe
of
hair
and
he
wore
it
cropped
short
.
It
was
almost
as
white
as
his
teeth
.
For
a
man
of
his
mass
he
was
curiously
short
.
He
was
n't
a
dwarf
but
he
was
a_bit
of
a
comic
figure
.
A
man
with
so
big
and
so
staggeringly
developed
a
torso
and
such
long
and
powerful
arms
is
expected
to
stand
taller
than
five
feet
five
.
For
Felix
it
was
a_bit
of
a
stretch
to
make
even
that
measurement
.
The
man
was
just
this
side
of
being
a
freak
.
We
waited
till
he
had
finished
laughing
,
and
that
gave
us
a_few
moments
for
taking_stock
of
him
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
manner
Esquire
might
suggest
for
the
outdoor_man
's
country
weekend
.
Dark
gray
sports_jacket
,
lighter
gray
slacks
,
pink
flannel
shirt
,
black
silk
necktie
.
His
eyes
were
clear
.
He
was
freshly
shaved
,
and
if
there
had
been
any
alcohol
in
him
we
could
never
have
missed
detecting
some
scent
of_it
on
the
massive
gusts
of
his
laughter
.
Not
even
a
whiff
.
Eventually
he
subsided
.
``
Felix
''
?
Gibby
said
.
``
Me
''
,
he
said
merrily
.
``
Me
,
the
happy
one
''
.
``
That_much
Latin
we
remember
''
,
Gibby
said
dryly
.
``
You
always
live_up_to
your
name
,
always
like
this
,
always
making_happy
''
?
``
I
try
''
,
Felix
said
blithely
.
``
The
world
is
full
of
blokes
who
put
their
hearts
into
making
the
tragic
scene
.
I
've
never
noticed
that
it
improves
things
any
''
.
``
Bully
for
you
''
,
Gibby
said
.
``
What
's
the
rest
of
your
name
''
?
``
No
rest
of_it
.
Felix
is
all
there
is
''
.
``
All
there
ever
was
''
?
``
The
past
I
leave
to
historians
''
,
Felix
intoned
,
demonstrating
that
he
could
be
pompous
as_well_as
happy
.
``
You
live
in
the
present
''
?
``
In
the
present
''
,
Felix
proclaimed
.
``
For
the
future
.
Is
there
any
other
time
in
which
a
man
can
live
''
?
``
We
''
,
Gibby
announced
,
``
are
not
philosophers
.
We
are
Assistant_District_Attorneys
.
This
gentleman
is
a
police_officer
.
He
is
a
fingerprint_specialist
.
Could
your
future
,
your
immediate
future
,
be
made
to
include
taking
us
upstairs
,
giving
us
a_bit
of
space
in
which
our
friend
can
work
,
and
making
available
to
him
your
finger_tips
''
?
The
happy
one
could
never
have
looked
happier
.
This
was
more_than
joy
.
It
was
ecstasy
.
``
Those
lovely
whorls
''
,
he
chortled
.
``
So
intricate
,
so
beautiful
.
Come_right_along
.
I
love
fingerprints
''
.
He
was
prancing
along
the
hall
,
heading
for
the
next
flight_of_stairs
.
Gibby
called
him
back
.
``
We
're
here
because
of_what
happened
last
night
''
,
he
said
.
``
Past
,
yes
,
but
important
.
Since
it
is
important
,
for
the
record
let
's
have
the
full
name
''
.
``
That
important
''
?
Felix
asked
.
``
That
important
''
.
``
Grubb
''
,
Felix
whispered
.
``
Felix_Grubb
''
?
Gibby
asked
,
not
bothering
to
whisper
.
``
Shh
''
,
Felix
implored
.
``
I
can
n't
see
what
would
make
it
necessary
for
you
to
know
.
Nothing
could
make
it
necessary
to
proclaim
it
to
the
whole
world
''
.
Obligingly
Gibby
lowered
his
voice
.
``
Felix_Grubb
''
?
he
repeated
.
``
No
.
Edmund
,
but
not
for
years
.
For
years
it
's
been
just
Felix
.
First
thing
I
did
after
my
twenty-first
birthday
was
go_into
court
and
have
it
officially
changed
,
and
this
is
something
I
do
n't
tell
everybody
.
That
was
almost
forty
years
ago
''
.
Having
volunteered
that
he
was
a
man
of
about
sixty
,
he
bounded
up_the_stairs
and
with
each
leap
rendered
the
number
less
credible
.
This
was
a
broth_of_a_boy
,
our
Felix
,
and
nothing
was
more
obvious
than
the
joy
he
took
in
demonstrating
how
agile
he
was
and
how
full
of
juice
and
spirit
.
We
followed
him
up_the_stairs
.
The
cops
would
gather_up
Connor
and
the
foursome
on
the
third
floor
and
bring
us
those
of
them
who
would
voluntarily
submit
to
fingerprinting
.
You
may
think
we
did
n't
need
Nancy
and
Jean
,
but
you
always
get
what
you
can
when
you
can
,
and
we
had
no
guarantee
that
a
fingerprint
record
on
them
could
n't
be
useful
before
we
were
through_with
this
case
.
Also
,
if
we
had
excluded
the
ladies
we
would
have_to
that
extent
let
the
whole
world
know
at_least
that
much
of
where
we
stood
.
The
killer
,
if
in
our
present
group
,
would
certainly
be
interested
in
knowing
that
much
,
and
even_though
with
the
fingerprint
evidence
what
it
was
I
could
see
no
way
he
could
use
this
bit
of
information
to
improve
on
his
situation
,
there
might
always
be
some
way
.
If
you
can
possibly
avoid
it
,
you
do
n't
hand_out
any
extra
chances
.
Felix
took
us
into
his
studio
.
It
was
that
oddly
shaped
space
at
the
very
top
of
the
house
,
where
ceiling
heights
had
to
accommodate
themselves
to
the
varying
angles
of
roof
slope
.
At
each
angle
of
its
pitch
a
big
skylight
had
been
fitted
into
the
roof
and
all
these
skylights
were
fitted
with
systems
of
multiple
screens
and
shades
.
When
Felix
first
opened
the
door
on_it
,
all
these
shades
were
tightly
drawn
and
the
whole
studio
was
as
dark
as
night
.
He
quickly
fixed
that
,
rolling
back
the
shades
on
some
of
the
skylights
and
adjusting
screens
on
the
others
.
He
flew
about
the
place
making
these
adjustments
and
it
was
obvious
that
what
he
was
doing
was
the
fruit
of
long
experience
.
None
of
his
movements
was
tentative
.
There
was
no
process
of
trial_and_error
.
Starting
with
the
room
completely
blacked_out
,
as
it
was
when
we
came_in
,
he
unerringly
fixed
things
so
that
the
whole
place
was
bathed
in
the
maximum
of
light
without
at
any
point
admitting
even
so
much
as
a
crack
of
glare
.
Expecting
something
more-than
average
wacky
,
I
was
surprised
by
what
we
found
.
There
was
no
display
of
either
works_in_progress
or
of
finished
work
.
Here_and_there
on
work_table
or
pedestal
stood
a
shape
with
a
sheet
or
a
tarpaulin
draped
over
it
.
These
shapes
might
have
been
mad
,
but
there
was
no
telling
.
They
were
all
completely
shrouded
.
The
equipment
was
solid
and
heavy
and
in
good
condition
.
Everything
was
orderly
and
it
seemed
to
be
arranged
for
the
workman
's
comfort
,
convenience
and
efficiency
.
There
were
tools
about
but
they
were
neatly
kept
.
There
was
no
confusion
and
no
litter
.
Supplies
of
sheet_metal
were
neatly
stacked
in
bins
.
