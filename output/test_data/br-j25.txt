Tension
management
and
communication
of
sentiment
are
the
processes
involved
in
the
functioning
of
the
element
of
sentiment
or
feeling
.
One
of
the
devices
for
tension
management
is
preferential
mating
.
The
preferential
mating
of_this
particular
population
has
been
analyzed
in
a
separate
study
.
The
relative
geographical
isolation
of
the
Brandywine
population
makes_for
a
limited
choice
in
mating
.
It
would
seem
necessary
that
members
of_this
population
provide
support
for
one
another
since
it
is
not
provided
by
the
larger
society
.
The
supportive
relations
can
apparently
be
achieved
in
geographical
and
social
isolation
.
The
newlyweds
building
homes
on
the
same
land
with
either
set
of
parents
,
and
the
almost
exclusive
use
of
members
of
the
population
as
sponsors
for
baptisms
and
weddings
illustrate
this
supportive
relationship
.
As
Loomis
remarks
,
``
In
the
internal
pattern
the
chief
reason
for
interacting
is
to
communicate
liking
,
friendship
,
and
love
among
those
who
stand
in
supporting
relations_to
one
another
and
corresponding
negative
sentiments
to
those
who
stand
in
antagonistic
relations
''
.
Maintenance
of
the
status_quo
might
seem
to
be
the
appropriate
goal
or
objective
of_this
population
today
.
Yet
,
the
object
of
the
element
of
achieving
through
the
process
of
goal
attaining
for
this
population
appears
to
have
been
changed
by
circumstances
brought_about
by
the
war
.
Prior
to
World_War
2
,
there
was
a
higher
percentage
of
endogamous
marriages
than
after
World_war
2
,
.
The
norms
,
as
elements
,
refer
to
``
all
criteria
for
judging
the
character
or
conduct
of
both
individual
and
group_actions
in
any
social_system
''
.
The
process
of
evaluation
assigns
varying
positive
and
negative
priorities
or
values
to
elements
.
The
elements
and
processes
become
evident
in
a
study
of
mate
selection
in_this
population
.
From
the
evidence
``
it
may
be
conjectured
that
core-core
marriages
are
the
preferred
unions
for
core
males
and
females
;
core-marginal
marriages
still
belong
in
the
category
of
permissive
unions
;
and
core-Negro
marriages
are
proscribed
for
core
members
''
.
The
element
of
status-roles
and
associated
processes
have
not
been
sufficiently
investigated
for
this
population
to
permit
any
type
of
conjectures
about
them
.
There
is
some
indication
from
a
limited
number
of
interviews
with
members
of
the
population
that
the
element
of
power
,
primarily
the
voluntary
influence
of
non-authoritative
power
,
has
been
exerted
on
actors
in
the
system
,
particularly
in
regard_to
mate
selection
.
This
would
seem
to
vary
from
family
to
family
,
depending
somewhat
on
the
core
or
marginal
``
status
''
of_that
family
.
Again
,
size
of
the
group
may
have
some
influence
on
the
strength
of
group
controls
.
Interviews
with
members
of
the
Brandywine
population
were
attempted
in_order_to
discover
the
ranking
of
the
various
families
in
the
population
.
The
large
majority
of
the
interviewees
placed
core
families
in
the
upper
positions
.
Loomis
considers
ranking
a
product
of
the
evaluation
process
.
``
The
standing
or
rank
of
an
actor
in
a
given
social_system
is
determined
by
the
evaluation
placed
upon
the
actor
and
his
acts
in_accordance_with
the
norms
and
standards
of
the
system
''
.
Despite
the
increasing
rate
of
exogamous
marriages
,
the
population
has
been
able
to
sustain
,
at_least
to_some_degree
,
the
consciousness
of
its
intermediate
status
in
society
.
To_some_extent
the
system
can
be
considered
a
Gemeinschaft
in_which
``
social-role
occupancies
are
determined
by
birth
,
by
attributes
such_as
sex
or
caste
,
which
are
biologically
or
socially
immutable
''
.
The
adherence
of
many
in
the
population
to
the
Indian
background
in
their
pedigree
,
and
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
their
ancestors
had
never
been
slaves
,
becomes
of
prime
interest
in
determining
how
far
these
elements
promote
the
self-image
of
the
intermediate
status
of
the
group
in
society
.
The
negative
sanctions
applied
to
core-Negro
marriages
for
core
members
act_as
indicators
of
expected
adherence
to
group
norms
.
However
,
because
of
Church
laws
,
lately
more
stringently
enforced
,
which
forbid
the
marriage
of
cousins
closely
related
consanguineously
,
a
means
of
facilitating
the
goal
of
in-group
relations
may
be
that
of
recourse
to
illegitimate
unions
.
A
cursory
survey
of
available
material
indicates
a
high
rate
of
illegitimate
births
occurring
to
parents
who
have
a
close
consanguineous
relationship
.
The
comprehensive
or
master
processes
activate
all
or
some
of
the
elements
within
the
social_system
and
subsystems
.
Within
the
larger
social_system
are
the
structural
and
functional
subsystems
.
The
structural
subsystem
,
consisting_of
relatively
stable
inter-relationships
among
its
parts
,
includes
.
Subgroups
of
various
types
,
interconnected
by
relational
norms
.
Roles
of
various
types
,
within
the
larger
system
and
within
the
subgroups
.
Regulative
norms
governing
subgroups
and
roles
.
Cultural
values
.
In
the
study
of
marriage
patterns
for
this
group
,
consanguinity
produces
the
structural
system
-
a
system
of
affinities
-
which
,
in_turn
,
maintains
the
system
of
consanguinity
.
Subgroups
of
various
types
have
been
found
within
this
system
.
Each
family_line
can
be
considered
a
substructure
.
There
seems
to
be
an
implied
cultural
value
attached_to
the
fact
of
core
status
within
the
group
.
Additionally
,
the
proscription
of
core-Negro
marriages
for
core
families
,
discussed
above
,
would
seem
to
act_as
a
regulative
norm
governing
subgroups
and
roles
.
The
scope
of_this
study
does
not
provide_for
the
study
of
roles
of
various
types
within
the
larger
system
or
within
the
subgroups
.
However
,
it
cannot
be
presumed
,
informal
though
the
structure
of
the
population
seems
,
that
there
are
not
well-defined
roles
within
the
system
.
The
present
study
relates
to
the
theory
of
functional
systems
.
It
is
hypothesized
that
fertility
is
a
function
of
the
social_system
when
the
population
as_a_whole
is
considered
and
a
function
of
the
subsystems
when
the
two-fold
division
of
core
families
and
marginal
families
is
considered
.
The
four
functional
problems
of
a
social_system
are
,
to_some_extent
,
solved
by
the
subsystems
within
this
population
.
By
means
of
geographical
isolation
and
high
fertility_rates
,
inbreeding
can
be
fostered
and
the
pattern
of
isolation
from
the
greater
society
maintained
.
In_order_to
attain
the
goal
of
group
solidarity
and
to
relieve
tension
,
the
high
fertility_rate
provides
more
group
members
for
mate
selection
,
and
the
clustering
of
members
in
groups
fosters
acceptance
of
group
controls
.
To
maintain
their
intermediate
position
in
the
larger
society
,
it
is
not_only
necessary
that
members
of_this
population
be
``
visible
''
,
but
that
their
numbers
be
great
enough
to
be
recognized
as
a
separate
,
distinct
grouping
or
system
in
society
.
As
mentioned
above
,
where
families
are
concentrated
in
larger
numbers
,
group
controls
seem
strongest
and
most
effective
.
Adaptation
to
the
social
and
non-social
environment
through
the
economy
has
been
met
to
a
degree
through
a
type
of
occupational
segregation
.
This
provides
the
necessary
contact
with
the
larger
society
,
while
supporting
a
type
of
control
over
members
in_terms_of
social
contacts
.
Integration
``
has
to
do
with
the
inter-relation
of
parts
''
.
The
problem
of
solidarity
and
morale
again
involves
the
concept
of
values
.
The
values
placed
by
the
Brandywine
population
,
upon
maintaining
a
certain
homogeneity
,
a
certain
separate
racial
identity
,
and
therefore
a
certain
separate
social_status
,
are
important
for
the
morale
of
the
system
.
Since
morale
is
closely
related
to
pattern
maintenance
and
integration
,
the
higher
the
morale
and
solidarity
,
the
better
the
system
can
solve
the
problems
of
the
system
.
In_this
respect
it
would
seem
that
the
greater
the
social
distance
between
the
Brandywine
population
and
the
white
and
Negro
populations
within
the
same
general
locality
,
the
greater
the
possibility
for
higher
morale
and
solidarity
within
the
Brandywine
population
.
It
is
conceived
that
one
of
the
means
to
attain
this
social
distance
is
that
of
physical
and
social
isolation
.
In_turn
,
higher
fertility_rates
for
this
population
provide
a
means
of
increasing
the
numerical_quantity
of
the
population
,
allowing_for
the
possibility
of
greater
stability
and
unity
.
The
population
can
thereby
replenish
itself
and
actually
grow
larger
.
Of
particular
utility
in
the
analysis
of
the
development
,
persistence
,
and
change
of
social_systems
has
been
the
use
of
the
master
or
comprehensive
processes
.
Loomis
considers
six
such
processes
in
his
paradigm
.
1
.
Communication
2
.
Boundary
maintenance
3
.
Systemic
linkage
4
.
Socialization
5
.
Social_control
6
.
Institutionalization
Though
undoubtedly
all
six
processes
are
operative
within
the
whole
social_system
and
its
subsystems
,
two
processes
that
are
of
crucial
importance
to
this
study
will
be
singled_out
for
particular
emphasis
:
In
discussing
the
process
of
communication
,
Loomis
defines
it
as
``
the
process
by
which
information
,
decisions
,
and
directives
are
transmitted
among
actors
and
the
ways
in_which
knowledge
,
opinions
,
and
attitudes
are
formed
,
or
modified
by
interaction
''
.
Communication
may
be
facilitated
by
means
of
the
high
visibility
within
the
larger
community
.
Intense
interaction
is
easier
where
segregated
living
and
occupational
segregation
mark_off
a
group
from
the
rest
of
the
community
,
as
in
the
case
of_this
population
.
However
,
the
factor
of
physical
isolation
is
not
a
static
situation
.
Although
the
Brandywine
population
is
still
predominantly
rural
,
``
there
are
indications
of
a
consistent
and
a
statistically
significant
trend
away
from
the
older
and
relatively
isolated
rural
communities
&
&
&
urbanization
appears
to
be
an
important
factor
in
the
disintegration
of_this
group
.
This
conclusion
is
,
however
,
an
over-simplification
.
A
more
realistic
analysis
must
take_into_account
the
fact
that
Brandywine
people
in
the
urban-fringe
area
are
,
in_general
,
less
segregated
locally
than
group
members
in
rural_areas
.
In
the
urban_area
,
in_other_words
,
they
,
unlike
some
urban
ethnic_groups
,
do
not
concentrate
in
ghetto
colonies
.
Group
pressures
toward
conformity
are
slight
or
non-existent
,
and
deviant
behavior
in
mate
selection
incurs
few
if
any
social
sanctions
.
In
such
a
setting
social
contacts
and
associations
are
likely
to
be
heterogamous
,
resulting
in
a
change
of
values
and
almost
necessarily
,
in
mate
selection
behavior
.
To
the
extent
that
urban
life
contributes
to
the
breakdown
of
the
group
patterns
of
residential
isolation
,
to_that_extent
it
contributes
directly
to
increased
exogamy
''
.
The
process
of
social_control
is
operative
insofar
as
sanctions
play
a
part
in
the
individual
's
behavior
,
as_well
as
the
group
's
behavior
.
By
means
of_this
social_control
,
deviance
is
either
eliminated
or
somehow
made
compatible
with
the
function
of
the
social_group
.
Examples
from
this
population
indicate
that
deviance
seems
to
be
sanctioned
by
ostracism
from
the
group
.
There
is
an
oral
tradition
among
the
members
of
the
population
in
regard_to
the
origin
and
subsequent
separate
status
of
the
group
in
the
larger
society
.
Confused
and
divided
though
this
tradition
may
be
,
it
is
an
important
part
of
the
social
and
cultural
heritage
of
the
group
,
and
acts_as
a
means
of
socialization
,
particularly
for
members
of
the
rural
community
.
The
fact
of
Indian
ancestry
and
``
free
''
status
during
the
days
of
slavery
,
are
important
distinctions
made
by
members
of
the
group
.
``
Culturally
induced
social
cohesion
resulting
from
common
norms
and
values
internalized
by
members
of
the
group
''
is
operative
in
the
boundary
maintenance
of
the
group
as_well
as
in
the
process
of
socialization
.
The
process
of
boundary
maintenance
identifies
and
preserves
the
social_system
or
subsystems
,
and
the
characteristic
interaction
is
maintained
.
As
the
threat
of
encroachment
on
the
system
increases
,
the
``
probability
of
applied
boundary
maintenance
mechanisms
increases
''
.
The
fertility_rate
pattern
would
seem
to
be
a
function
,
though
a
latent
one
,
of
the
process
of
maintaining
the
boundary
.
``
Increased
boundary
maintenance
may
be
achieved
,
for_example
,
by
assigning
a
higher
primacy
or
evaluation
to
activities
characteristic
of
the
external
pattern
''
.
The
external
pattern
or
external
system
can
be
considered
as
``
group
behavior
that
enables
the
group
to
survive
in
its
environment
''
.
Boundary
maintenance
for
this
group
would
seem
to
be
primarily
social
,
as
is
the
preference
for
endogamy
.
It
is
also
expressed
in
the
proscription
against
deviants
in
the_matter
of
endogamy
,
particularly
in
rural_areas
.
By
their
pattern
of
endogamy
and
exogamy
,
the
core
families
and
the
marginal
families
show
distinct
limits
to
the
intergroup
contact
they
maintain
.
Where
boundary
maintenance
describes
the
boundaries
or
limits
of
the
group
,
systemic
linkage
is
defined
``
as
the
process
whereby
one
or
more
of
the
elements
of
at_least
two
social_systems
is
articulated
in
such
a
manner
that
the
two
systems
in
some
ways
and
on
some
occasions
may
be
viewed_as
a
single
unit
.
