Can
thermonuclear
war
be
set_off
by_accident
?
What
steps
have
been
taken
to
guard
against
the
one
sort_of
mishap
that
could
trigger
the
destruction
of
continents
?
Are
we
as
safe
as
we
should
be
from
such
a
disaster
?
Is
anything
being
done
to
increase
our
margin
of
safety
?
Will
the
danger
increase
or
decrease
?
I
have
just
asked
these
questions
in
the
Pentagon
,
in
the
White_House
,
in
offices
of
key
scientists
across_the_country
and
aboard
the
submarines
that
prowl
for
months
underwater
,
with
neat
rows
of
green
launch
tubes
which
contain
Polaris
missiles
and
which
are
affectionately
known
as
``
Sherwood_Forest
''
.
I
asked
the
same
questions
inside
the
launch-control
rooms
of
an
Atlas
missile
base
in
Wyoming
,
where
officers
who
wear
sidearms
are
manning
the
``
commit
buttons
''
that
could
start
a
war
-
accidentally
or
by_design
-
and
in
the
command
centers
where
other
pistol-packing
men
could
give
orders
to
push
such
buttons
.
To
the
men
in
the
instrument-jammed
bomber
cockpits
,
submarine
compartments
and
the
antiseptic
,
windowless
rooms
that
would
be
the
foxholes
of
tomorrow
's
impersonal
intercontinental
wars
,
the
questions
seem
farfetched
.
There
is
unceasing
pressure
,
but
its
sources
are
immediate
.
``
Readiness
exercises
''
are
almost
continuous
.
Each
could
be
the
real_thing
.
In
the
command
centers
there
are
special
clocks
ready_to
tick
off
the
minutes
elapsed
since
``
E
hour
''
.
``
E
''
stands_for
``
execution
''
-
the
moment
a
``
go
order
''
would
unleash
an
American
nuclear
strike
.
There
is
little
time
for
the
men
in
the
command
centers
to
reflect
about
the
implications
of
these
clocks
.
They
are
preoccupied
riding_herd_on
control_panels
,
switches
,
flashing
colored
lights
on
pale
green
or
gray
consoles
that
look_like
business
machines
.
They
know
little
about
their
machinery
beyond
mechanical
details
.
Accidental
war
is
so
sensitive
a
subject
that
most_of
the
people
who
could
become
directly
involved
in
one
are
told
just
enough
so
they
can
perform
their
portions
of
incredibly
complex
tasks
.
Among
the
policy
makers
,
generals
,
physicists
,
psychologists
and_others
charged
with
controlling
the
actions
of
the
button
pushers
and
their
``
hardware
''
,
the
answers
to
my
questions
varied
partly
according
to_a_man
's
flair
for
what
the
professionals
in_this
field
call
``
scenarios
''
.
As
an
Air_Force
psychiatrist
put
it
:
``
You
can
n't
have
dry_runs
on
this
one
''
.
The
experts
are
thus
forced
to
hypothesize
sequences
of
events
that
have
never
occurred
,
probably
never
will
-
but
possibly
might
.
Only
one
rule
prevailed
in
my
conversations
with
these
men
:
The
more
highly
placed
they
are
-
that_is
,
the
more
they
know
-
the
more
concerned
they
have
become
.
Already
accidental
war
is
a
silent
guest
at
the
discussions
within
the
Kennedy_Administration
about
the
urgency
of
disarmament
and
nearly
all
other
questions
of
national
security
.
Only
recently
new
``
holes
''
were
discovered
in
our
safety
measures
,
and
a
search
is
now
on
for
more
.
Work
is
under_way
to
see
whether
new
restraining
devices
should
be_installed
on
all
nuclear_weapons
.
Meanwhile
,
the
experts
speak
of
wars
triggered
by
``
false
pre-emption
''
,
``
escalation
''
,
``
unauthorized
behavior
''
and
other
terms
that
will
be
discussed
in_this
report
.
They
inhabit
a
secret
world
centered
on
``
go
codes
''
and
``
gold
phones
''
.
Their
conversations
were
,
almost
invariably
,
accompanied
by
the
same
gestures
-
arms
and
pointed
forefingers
darting
toward
each
other
in
arclike
semicircular
motions
.
One
arm
represented
our
bombers
and
missiles
,
the
other
arm
``
theirs
''
.
Yet
implicit_in
each
movement
was
the
death
of
millions
,
perhaps
hundreds
of
millions
,
perhaps
you
and
me
-
and
the
experts
.
These
men
are
not
callous
.
It
is
their
job
to
think_about
the
unthinkable
.
Unanimously
they
believe
that
the
world
would
become
a
safer
place
if
more
of
us
-
and
more
Russians
and
Communist
Chinese
,
too
-
thought_about
accidental
war
.
The
first
systematic
thinking
about
this
Pandora
's
box
within
Pandora
's
boxes
was
done
four
years
ago
by
Fred_Ikle
,
a
frail
,
meek-mannered
Swiss-born
sociologist
.
He
was
,
and
is
,
with
the
RAND_Corporation
,
a
nonprofit
pool
of
thinkers
financed
by
the
U._S.
Air_Force
.
His
investigations
made
him
the
Paul_Revere
of
accidental
war
,
and
safety
procedures
were
enormously
increased
.
In
recent
weeks
,
as
a
result
of
a
sweeping
defense_policy
reappraisal
by
the
Kennedy_Administration
,
basic
United_States
strategy
has
been
modified
-
and
large
new
sums
allocated
-
to
meet
the
accidental-war
danger
and
to
reduce
it
as
quickly
as
possible
.
The
chain
starts
at
BMEWS
(
Ballistic_Missile
Early_Warning_System
)
in
Thule
,
Greenland
.
Its
radar
screens
would
register
Soviet
missiles
shortly
after
they
are
launched
against
the
United_States
.
BMEWS
intelligence
is
simultaneously
flashed
to
NORAD
(
North_American
Air_Defense
Command
)
in
Colorado_Springs
,
Colorado
,
for
interpretation
;
to
the
SAC
command
and
control
post
,
forty-five
feet
below
the
ground
at
Offutt
Air_Force
Base
,
near
Omaha
,
Nebraska
;
to
the
Joint_War_Room
of
the
Joint
Chiefs_of_Staff
in
the
Pentagon
and
to
the
President
.
Telephones
,
Teletypes
,
several
kinds
of
radio
systems
and
,
in
some
cases
,
television
,
link
all
vital
points
.
Alternate
locations
exist
for
all
key
command
centers
.
For
last-ditch
emergencies
SAC
has
alternate
command_posts
on
KC-135
jet
tankers
.
Multiple
circuits
,
routings
and
frequencies
make
the
chain
as
unbreakable
as
possible
.
The
same
principle
of
``
redundancy
''
applies
to
all
communications
on
these
special
networks
.
And
no
messages
can
be
transmitted
on
these
circuits
until
senders
and
receivers
authenticate
in_advance
,
by
special
codes
,
that
the
messages
actually
come
from
their
purported
sources
.
Additional
codes
can
be
used
to
challenge
and
counterchallenge
the
authentications
.
Only
the
President
is
permitted
to
authorize
the
use
of
nuclear_weapons
.
That
's
the
law
.
But
what
if
somebody
decides
to
break
it
?
The
President
cannot
personally
remove
the
safety
devices
from
every
nuclear
trigger
.
He
makes
the
momentous
decision
.
Hundreds
of
men
are
required
to
pass
the
word
to
the
button
pushers
and
to
push
the
buttons
.
What
if
one
or
more
of
them
turn
irrational
or
suddenly
,
coolly
,
decide
to
clobber
the
Russians
?
What
if
the
President
himself
,
in
the
language
of
the
military
,
``
goes_ape
''
?
Or
singlehandedly
decided
to
reverse
national
policy
and
hit
the
Soviets
without
provocation
?
Nobody
can
be
absolutely
certain
of
the
answers
.
However
,
the
system
is
designed
,
ingeniously
and
hopefully
,
so_that
no
one
man
could
initiate
a
thermonuclear
war
.
Even
the
President
cannot
pick_up
his
telephone
and
give
a
``
go
''
order
.
Even
he
does
not
know
the
one
signal
for
a
nuclear
strike
-
the
``
go
code
''
.
In
an
emergency
he
would
receive
available
intelligence
on
the
``
gold-phone
circuit
''
.
A
system
of
``
gold
''
-
actually
yellow
-
phones
connects
him
with
the
offices
and
action
stations
of
the
Secretary
of
Defense
,
the
Joint
Chiefs_of_Staff
,
the
SAC
commander
and
other
key
men
.
All
can
be_connected
with
the
gold
circuit
from
their
homes
.
All
could
help
the
President
make
his
decision
.
The
talk
would
not
be
in
code
,
but
neither
would
it
ramble
.
Vital
questions
would
be
quickly
answered
according
to
a
preprepared
agenda
.
Officers
who
participate
in
the
continual
practice
drills
assured
me
that
the
President
's
decision
could
be
made
and
announced
on
the
gold
circuit
within
minutes
after
the
first
flash
from
BMEWS
.
If
communications
work
,
his
decision
would
be
instantly
known
in_all
command_posts
that
would
originate
the
actual
go
order
.
For
these
centers
,
too
,
are
on
the
gold
circuit
.
They
include
the
Navy
's
Atlantic_Command
at
Norfolk
,
Virginia
,
which
is
in_contact
with
the
Polaris
subs
;
NATO
headquarters
in
Europe
;
Air_Force
forward
headquarters
in
Europe
and
in
the
Pacific
,
which
control
tactical
fighters
on
ships
and
land
bases
;
and
SAC
,
which
controls
long-range
bombers
and
Atlas
missiles
.
Let
us
look
in
on
one
of
these
nerve_centers
-
SAC
at
Omaha
-
and
see
what
must
still
happen
before
a
wing
of
B-52
bombers
could
drop
their
H-bombs
.
In
a
word
,
plenty
.
The
key
man
almost
certainly
would
be
Col._William_W._Wisman
,
SAC
's
senior
controller
.
He
or
his
deputy
or
one
of
their
seven
assistants
,
all
full
colonels
,
mans
the
heart
of
the
command_post
twenty-four_hours
a
day
.
It
is
a
quiet
but
impressive
room
-
140
feet
long
,
thirty-nine
feet
wide
,
twenty-one
feet
high
.
Movable
panels
of
floor-to-ceiling
maps
and
charts
are
crammed
with
intelligence
information
.
And
Bill_Wisman
,
forty-three
,
a
farmer
's
son
from
Beallsville
,
Ohio
,
is
a
quiet
but
impressive
man
.
His
eyes
are
steady
anchors
of
the
deepest
brown
.
His
movements
and
speech
are
precise
,
clear
and
quick
.
No
question
ruffles
him
or
causes
him
to
hesitate
.
Wisman
,
who
has
had
the
chief
controller
's
job
for
four
years
,
calls
the
signals
for
a
team
operating
three
rows
of
dull-gray
consoles
studded
with
lights
,
switches
and
buttons
.
At_least
a
dozen
men
,
some
armed
,
are
never
far
away
from
him
.
In_front
of
him
is
a
gold
phone
.
In
emergencies
the
SAC
commander
,
Gen._Thomas_Power
,
or
his
deputies
and
their
staff
would
occupy
a
balcony
that
stretches
across
the
length
of
the
room
above
Wisman
and
his
staff
.
At
General_Power
's
seat
in
the
balcony
there
is
also
a
gold
phone
.
General_Power
would
participate
in
the
decision_making
.
Wisman
,
below
,
would
listen_in
and
act
.
His
consoles
can
give
him
instant
contact
with
more_than
seventy
bases
around
the
world
and
with
every
SAC
aircraft
.
He
need
only
pick_up
one
of
the
two
red
telephone_receivers
at
his
extreme
left
,
right
next
to
the
big
red
button
marked
``
alert
''
.
(
There
are
two
receivers
in_case
one
should
be
dropped
and
damaged
.
)
But
Wisman
,
too
,
does
not
know
the
go
code
.
He
must
take
it
from
``
the
red
box
''
.
In_point_of_fact
,
this
is
a
beige
box
with
a
bright
red
door
,
about
one
and
a
half
feet
square
and
hung
from
the
wall
about
six
feet
from
the
door
to
Wisman
's
right
.
The
box
is
internally
wired
so
the
door
can
never
be
opened
without
setting_off
a
screeching
klaxon
(
``
It
's
real
obnoxious
''
)
.
Now
we
must
become
vague
,
for
we
are
approaching
one
of
the
nation
's
most
guarded
secrets
.
The
codes
in
the
red
box
-
there
are
several
of
them
covering
various
contingencies
-
are
contained
in
a
sealed
X-ray-proof
``
unique
device
''
.
They
are
supplied
,
a
batch
at_a_time
,
by
a
secret
source
and
are
continually
changed
by
Wisman
or
his
staff
,
at_random
intervals
.
But
even
the
contents
of
Wisman
's
box
cannot
start
a
war
.
They
are
mere
fragments
,
just
one
portion
of
preprepared
messages
.
What
these
fragments
are
and_how
they
activate
the
go
order
may_not
be_revealed
.
The
pieces
must
be
placed
in
the
context
of
the
prepared
messages
by
Wisman
's
staff
.
In_addition
to
the
authentication
and
acknowledgment
procedures
which
precede
and
follow
the
sending
of
the
go
messages
,
again
in
special
codes
,
each
message
also
contains
an
``
internal
authenticator
''
,
another
specific
signal
to
convince
the
recipient
that
he
is
getting
the
real_thing
.
I
asked
Wisman
what
would
happen
if
he
broke_out
the
go
codes
and
tried
to
start
transmitting
one
.
``
I
'd
wind_up
full_of
.38
bullet_holes
''
,
he
said
,
and
there
was
no
question
that
he
was
talking_about
bullets
fired
by
his
coworkers
.
Now
let
us
imagine
a
wing
of
B-52
's
,
on
alert
near
their
``
positive
control
(
or
fail-safe
)
points
''
,
the
spots
on
the
map
,
many
miles
from
Soviet
territory
,
beyond
which
they
are
forbidden
to
fly
without
specific
orders
to
proceed
to
their
targets
.
They
,
too
,
have
fragments
of
the
go
code
with
them
.
As
Wisman
put
it
,
``
They
have
separate
pieces
of
the
pie
,
and
we
have
the
whole
pie
.
Once
we
send_out
the
whole
pie
,
they
can
put
their
pieces
into
it
.
Unless
we
send_out
the
whole
pie
,
their
pieces
mean
nothing
''
.
Why
does
Wisman
's
ever-changing
code
always
mesh
with
the
fragments
in
possession
of
the
button
pushers
?
The
answer
is
a
cryptographic
secret
.
At_any_rate
,
three
men
out
of
a
six-man
B-52
crew
are
required
to
copy
down
Wisman
's
go-to-war
message
.
Each
must
match
Wisman
's
``
pie
''
with
the
fragment
that
he
carries
with
him
.
All
three
must
compare
notes
and
agree
to
``
go
''
.
After_that
,
it
requires
several
minutes
of
concentrated
work
,
including
six
separate
and
deliberate
actions
by
a
minimum
of
three
men
sitting
at
three
separate
stations
in
a
bomber
,
each
with
another
man
beside
him
to
help
,
for
an
armed
bomb
to
be_released
.
Unless
all
gadgets
are
properly
operated
-
and
the
wires
and
seals
from
the
handles
removed
first
-
no
damage
can
be
done
.
