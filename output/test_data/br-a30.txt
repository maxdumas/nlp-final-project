When
Dr._W._A._Swim
celebrated
his
75
th
birthday
at
the
Wilshire
Country_Club
,
guests
came
by
chartered
plane
from
all_over
the
country
.
A
flight
originating_in
Florida
picked_up
guests
on
the
East_Coast
and
Midwest
and
a
plane
left
from
Seattle
taking_on
passengers
at
West_Coast
points
.
Cocktails
and
a
buffet
supper
were
served
to
more_than
100
persons
who
had
known
Dr._Swim
when
he
practiced
in
Los_Angeles
.
He
started
practice
in
1917
,
and
served
on
the
State_Board
of
Medical_Examiners
.
Giving_up
the
violin
opened
a
whole
new
career
for
Ilona_Schmidl-Seeberg
,
a
tiny
Hungarian
who
Fritz_Kreisler
had
predicted
would
have
a
promising
career
on
the
concert
stage
.
A
heart_attack
when
she
was
barely
20
put
an
end
to
the
10
-
hour
daily
practicing
.
She
put
the
violin
away
and
took_out
some
linen
,
needles
and
yarn
to
while_away
the
long
,
idle
days
in
Budapest
.
Now
her
modern
tapestries
have
been
exhibited
on
two
continents
and
,
at
26
,
she
feels
she
is
on
the
threshold
of
a
whole
new
life
in
Los_Angeles
.
Her
days
as
an
art_student
at
the
University
of
Budapest
came
to
a
sudden
end
during
the
Hungarian
uprisings
in
1957
and
she
and
her
husband
Stephen
fled
to
Vienna
.
There
they
continued
their
studies
at
the
university
,
she
in
art
,
he
in
architecture
.
And
there
she
had
her
first
showing
of
tapestry
work
.
There
's
a_lot_of
talk
about
the
problem
of
education
in
America
today
.
What
most
people
do
n't
seem
to
realize
,
if
they
are
n't
tied_up
with
the
thing
as
I
am
,
is
that
90
%
of
the
problem
is
transportation
.
I
never
dreamed
of
the
logistical
difficulties
involved
until
,
at_long_last
,
both
of
my
boys
got
squeezed
into
high_school
.
It
seems
like
only
last
year
that
we
watched
them
set_out
up
the
hill
hand_in_hand
on
a
rainy_day
in
their
yellow
raincoats
to
finger-paint
at
the
grammar_school
.
Getting
to
and
from
school
was
no
problem
.
They
either
walked
or
were
driven
.
Now
they
go_to
a
high_school
that
is
two
miles
away
.
One
might
think
the
problem
would
be
similar
.
They
could
walk
,
ride
on
a
bus
or
be
driven
.
It
's
much
more
complex
than
that
.
Generally
,
they
go_to
school
with
a
girl
named
Gloriana
,
who
lives
down
the
block
,
and
has
a
car
.
This
is
a
way
of
getting
to
school
,
but
,
I
understand
,
it
entails
a
certain
loss
of
social_status
.
A
young_man
does
n't
like
to
be
driven
up
in_front
of
a
school
in
a
car
driven
by
a
girl
who
is
n't
even
in
a
higher
class
than
he
is
,
and
is
also
a
girl
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
walk
to
school
then
''
?
I
suggested
.
``
My
father
walked
,
through
two
miles
of
snow
,
in
Illinois
''
.
``
Did
you
''
?
I
was
asked
.
``
No
''
,
I
said
,
``
I
did
n't
happen
to
grow_up
in
Illinois
''
.
I
explained
,
however
,
that
I
had
my
share
of
hardship
in
making
my
daily
pilgrimage
to
the
feet
of
wisdom
.
I
had
to
ride
a
streetcar
two
miles
.
Sometimes
the
streetcar
was
late
.
Sometimes
there
were
n't
even
any
seats
.
I
had
to
stand_up
,
with
the
ladies
.
Sometimes
I
got_on
the
wrong
car
and
did
n't
get
to
school
at_all
,
but
wound_up
at
the
ocean
,
or
some
other
dismal
place
,
and
had_to
spend
the
day
there
.
I
've
tried
to
compromise
by
letting
them
take
the
little
car
now_and_then
.
When
they
do
that
my
wife
has
to
drive
me
to
work
in
the
big
car
.
She
has
to
have
at_least
one
car
herself
.
I
feel
a
certain
loss
of
status
when
I
am
driven
up
in_front
of
work
in
a
car
driven
by
my
wife
,
who
is
only
a
woman
.
Even
that
is
n't
satisfactory
.
If
they
have
to
take
any
car
,
they
'd
rather
take
the
big
one
.
They
say
that
when
they
take
a
car
,
Gloriana
does
n't
take
her
car
,
but
rides
with
them
.
But
when
Gloriana
rides
with
them
they
also
have
to
take
the
two
girls
who
usually
ride
with
her
,
so
the
little
car
is
n't
big
enough
.
The
logic
of_that
is
impeccable
,
of_course
,
except
that
I
feel
like
a
fool
being
driven
up_to
work
in
a_little
car
,
by
my
wife
,
when
everybody
knows
I
have
a
big
car
and
am
capable_of
driving
myself
.
The
solution
,
naturally
,
is
the
bus
.
However
,
it
's
a
half-mile
walk
down
a
steep
hill
from
our
house
to
the
bus
,
and
it
's
too
hard
on
my
legs
.
My
wife
could
drive
us
down
the
hill
and
we
could
all
walk
from
there
.
But
that
's
hardly
realistic
.
Nobody
walks
any_more
but
crackpots
and
Harry_Truman
,
and
he
's
already
got
an
education
.

Newcomers
of
social
note
from
other
parts
of
the
country
are
the
Ray
Carbones
,
formerly
of
Panama
;
the
Geddes
MacGregors
,
formerly
of
Scotland
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs._Werner_H._Althaus
,
formerly

.
Here
's
an
idea
for
a
child
's
room
that
is
easy
to
execute
and
is
completely
charming
,
using
puppets
for
lamp
bases
.
Most
children
love
the
animated
puppet
faces
and
their
flexible
bodies
,
and
they
prefer
to
see
them
as
though
the
puppets
were
in
action
,
rather_than
put_away
in
boxes
.
Displayed
as
lamps
,
the
puppets
delight
the
children
and
are
decorative
accent
.
To
create
such
a
lamp
,
order
a
wired
pedestal
from
any
lamp
shop
.
Measure
the
puppet
to
determine
the
height
of
the
light
socket
,
allowing
three
to
four
inches
above
the
puppet
's
head
.
Make_sure
that
the
metal
tube
through
which
the
wire
passes
is
in
the
shape
of
an
inverted
``
L
''
,
the
foot
of
the
``
L
''
about
three
inches
long
,
so_that
the
puppet
can
hang
directly
under
the
light
.
Using
the
strings
that
manipulate
the
puppet
,
suspend
him
from
the
light
fixture
by
tying
the
strings
to
the
lamp
base
.
In_this_way
,
you
can
arrange
his
legs
and
arms
in
any
desired
position
,
with
feet
,
or
one
foot
,
barely
resting_on
the
pedestal
.
If
the
puppets
are
of
uniform
size
,
you
can
change
them
in_accord
with
your
child
's
whims
.
Although
a
straight
drum
shade
would
be
adequate
and
sufficiently
neutral
that
the
puppets
could
be
changed
without
disharmony
,
it
is
far
more
fun
to
create
shades
in
the
gay
spirit
of
a
child
's
playtime
.
Those
illustrated
are
reminiscent_of
a
circus
top
or
a
merry-go-round
.
The
scalloped
edge
is
particularly
appealing
.
Today
's
trend
toward
furniture
designs
from
America
's
past
is
teaching
home-owners
and
decorators
a
renewed
respect
for
the
shrewd
cabinetmakers
of
our
Colonial
era
.
A
generation
ago
there
were
plenty
of
people
who
appreciated
antiques
and
fine
reproductions
.
In
the
background
lurked
the
feeling
,
however
,
that
these
pieces
,
beautiful
as
they
were
,
lacked
the
utilitarian
touch
.
So
junior
's
bedroom
was
usually
tricked_out
with
heavy
,
nondescript
pieces
that
supposedly
could
take
the
``
hard
knocks
''
,
while
the
fine
secretary
was
relegated
to
the
parlor
where
it
was
for
show
only
.
This
is
n't
true
of
the
many
homemakers
of
the
1960
's
,
according
to
decorator
consultant
,
Leland_Alden
.
Housewives
are
finding
literally
hundreds
of
ways
of
getting
the
maximum
use
out
of
traditional
designs
,
says
Mr._Alden
and
they
are
doing
it
largely
because
Colonial
craftsmen
had
``
an
innate
sense
of
the
practical
''
.
There
are
a_number_of
reasons
why
the
Eighteenth_Century
designer
had
to
develop
``
down
to
earth
''
designs
-
or
go
out
of
business
.
