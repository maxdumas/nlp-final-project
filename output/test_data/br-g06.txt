the
Maestro
quoted
The
Flying_Dutchman
,
as
he
told
of
his
career
and
wanderings
,
explaining
that
the
number
seven
had
significantly
recurred
in
his
life
several_times
.
The
music_director
of
the
Pittsburgh
Symphony_Orchestra
,
William_Steinberg
,
has
molded
his
group
into
a
prominent
musical_organization
,
which
is
his
life
.
When
he
added
to
his
Pittsburgh
commitments
the
directorship
of
the
London_Philharmonic_Orchestra
in
1958
,
he
conducted
one_hundred
fifty
concerts
within
nine
months
,
``
commuting
''
between
the
two
cities
.
This
schedule
became
too
strenuous
,
even
for
the
energetic
and
conscientious
Mr._Steinberg
.
His
London
contract
was
rescinded
,
and
now
,
he
explains
cheerfully
,
as
a
bright
smile
lightens
his
intense
,
mobile
face
,
``
I
conduct
only
one_hundred
and
twenty
concerts
''
!
Our
meeting
took_place
in
May
,
1961
,
during
one
of
the
Maestro
's
stop-overs
in
New_York
,
before
he
left
for
Europe
.
As
we
began
to
converse
in
the
lounge
of
his
Fifth_Avenue
hotel
,
his
restlessness
and
sensitivity
to
light
and
sound
became
immediately
apparent
.
Seeking
an
obscure
,
dark
,
relatively
quiet
corner
in
the
airy
room
otherwise
suffused
with
afternoon
sunshine
,
he
asked
if
the
soft
background
music
could
be
turned_off
.
Unfortunately
,
it
was
Muzak
,
which
automatically
is
piped_into
the
public
rooms
,
and
which
nolens
volens
had
to
be
endured
.
As
he
talked_about
himself
,
time_and_again
stuffing
and
dragging
on
his
pipe
,
Steinberg
began
to
relax
and
the
initial
hurried
feeling
grew
faint
and
was
dispelled
.
Did
he
come
from
a
musical
family
?
Yes
:
though
not
professional
musicians
,
they
were
a
music-loving
family
.
In
his
native
Cologne
,
where
his
mother
taught
him
to
play
the
piano
,
he
was
able
to
read
notes
before
he
learned
the
alphabet
.
She
even
devised
a
system
of
colors
,
whereby
the
boy
could
easily
distinguish
the
different
note
values
.
When
he
started
school
at
the
age
of
five-and-a-half
,
he
could
not
understand
why
the
alphabet
begins
with
the
letter
A
,
instead
of
C
,
as
in
the
scale
.
Because
,
like
many
other
children
,
he
intensely
disliked
practicing
Czerny_Etudes
,
he
composed
his
own
studies
.
When
he
was
eight
he
began
violin_lessons
.
Soon
he
was
playing
in
the
Cologne_Municipal_Orchestra
,
and
during
World_War
1
,
,
when
musicians
were
scarce
,
he
joined
the
opera
orchestra
as_well
.
Steinberg
claims
that
these
early
years
of
orchestra
participation
were
of
invaluable
help
to
his
career
.
``
By
observing
the
conductor
''
,
he
says
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
,
``
I
learned
how
not
to
conduct
''
.
The
musician
ran_away
from
school
when
he
was
fifteen
,
but
this
escapade
did
not
save
him
from
the
Gymnasium
.
Simultaneously
,
he
pursued
his
musical
studies
at
the
conservatory
,
receiving
sound
training
in
counterpoint
and
harmony
,
as_well
in
the
violin
and
piano
.
His
professional
career
began
when
he
was
twenty
;
he
became
Otto_Klemperer
's
personal
assistant
at
the
Cologne_Opera
,
and
a
year
later
was
promoted
to
the
position
of
regular
conductor
.
Was
n't
this
an
unusually
young
age
to
fill
such
a
responsible
post
?
Yes
,
the
Maestro
assented
.
Had
he
always
wished
to
be
a
conductor
?
No
,
originally
he
had
hoped
to
become
a
concert
pianist
and
had
even
performed
as_such
.
However
,
when
he
assumed
the
duties
of
a
conductor
,
he
relinquished
his
career
as
a
pianist
.
Five
years
were
spent
with
the
Cologne_Opera
,
after
which
he
was
called
to
Prague
by
Alexander_von_Zemlinsky
,
teacher
of
Arnold_Scho
^
nberg
and
Erich_Korngold
.
In
1927
he
succeeded
Zemlinsky
as
opera
director
of
the
German
Theater
at
Prague
.
During
his
tenure
he
also
fulfilled
guest
engagements
at
the
Berlin_State_Opera
.
Two
years
later
he
became
director
of
the
Frankfurt_Opera
,
where
he
remained
until
he
lost
this
position
in
1933
through
the
rise
of
the
Hitler
regime
.
During
these
years
the
youthful
conductor
had
contributed
greatly
to
the
high
level
of
musical
life
in
Germany
.
He
had
presented
the
first
German
performances
of
Puccini
's
Manon_Lescaut
and
de
Falla
's
La_Vida_Breve
.
The
Frankfurt
years
were
particularly
noteworthy
for
his
performance
of
Berg
's
Wozzek
soon
after
the
Berlin
premiere
under
Erich_Kleiber
,
and
the
world
premiere
of
Scho
^
nberg
's
Von
heute
auf
morgen
.
At
the
outset
of
his
career
,
Steinberg
had
dedicated
himself
to
the
advancement
of
contemporary
music
by
vowing
to
do
a
Scho
^
nberg
work
every_year
.
In
Frankfurt
,
too
,
he
directed
the
Museum
and
Opera_House
concerts
which
,
in_addition
to
the
standard
repertoire
,
featured
novelties
like
Erdmann
's
Piano_Concerto
and
Mahler
's
Sixth_Symphony
.
Because
of
the
political
upheaval
in
Germany
in
the
1930
's
,
Steinberg
was
forced
to
restrict
his
activities
to
the
Jewish
community
.
Through
the
Frankfurt_Jewish_Kulturbund
he
began
to
give
sonata
recitals
in
synagogues
,
with
Cellist_Emanuel_Feuermann
.
As
more_and_more
Jewish
musicians
lost
their
jobs
with
professional
organizations
Steinberg
united
them
into
the
Frankfurt_Kulturbund_Orchestra
,
which
also
gave
guest
performances
in
other
German
cities
.
In
1936
he
accepted
the
leadership
of
the
Berlin_Kulturbund
.
In
the
fall
of_that
year
the
best
musicians
of
the
Berlin
and
Frankfurt_Kulturbund
orchestras
joined
under
the
combined
efforts
of
Bronislaw_Hubermann
and
Steinberg
to
become
the
Palestine_Orchestra
-
now
known
as
the
Israel_Philharmonic_Orchestra
-
with
Steinberg
as
founder-conductor
.
In
1938
,
at
the
insistence
of
Arturo_Toscanini
,
Steinberg
left
Germany
for
the
United_States
,
by
way
of
Switzerland
.
After
he
had
spent
the
first
three
years
in
New_York
as
associate
conductor
,
at
Toscanini
's
invitation
,
of
the
NBC_Orchestra
,
he
made
numerous
guest
appearances
throughout
the
United_States
and
Latin_America
.
In
1945
he
became
conductor
of
the
Buffalo_Philharmonic
.
Seven
years
later
he
was
asked
to
become
director
of
the
Pittsburgh_Symphony
.
Since
1944
he
has
also
conducted
regularly
at
the
San_Francisco
Opera
,
where
he
made
his
debut
with
a
memorable
performance
of
Verdi
's
Falstaff
.
In
recent
years
he
has
traveled
widely
in
Europe
,
conducting
in
Italy
,
France
,
Austria
,
and
Switzerland
.
He
returned
to
Germany
for_the_first_time
in
1953
,
where
he
has
since
conducted
in
Cologne
,
Frankfurt
,
and
Berlin
.
Where
in
Europe
was
he
going
now
?
First_of_all
,
to
Italy
for
a
short
vacation
-
Forte_dei_Marmi
,
a
place
he
loves
.
Since
it
is
not
far
from
Viareggio
,
he
will
visit
Puccini
's
house
,
as
he
never
fails
to
do
,
to
pay
his
respects_to
the
memory
of
the
composer
of
La_Boheme
,
which
he
considers
one
of
Puccini
's
masterpieces
.
Steinberg
spoke
with
warmth
and
enthusiasm
about
Italy
:
``
Rome
is
my
second
home
.
I
consider
it
the
center
of
the
world
and
make
it
a
point
to
be
there
once
a
year
''
.
He
will
conduct
two
concerts
at
the
Accademia_di_Santa_Cecilia
,
as_well
as
concerts
in
Munich
and
Cologne
.
``
Then
I
return
to
the
United_States
for
engagements
at
the
Hollywood_Bowl
and
in
Philadelphia
''
,
he
added
.
The
forthcoming
season
in
Pittsburgh
also
promises
to
be
of
unusual
interest
.
There
will
be
premieres
of
new
works
,
made
possible
through
Ford_Foundation
commissions
:
Carlisle_Floyd
's
Mystery
,
with
Phyllis_Curtin
as
soprano
soloist
.
Other
world
premieres
will
be
Gardner_Read
's
Third_Symphony
and
Burle_Marx
's
Samba_Concertante
.
``
And
next
year
we
will
do
-
also
a
Ford
commission
-
a
piano
concerto
by
Elliott_Carter
,
with
Jacob_Lateiner
as
soloist
.
Of_course
,
I
shall
conduct
Mahler
and
Bruckner
works
in
the
coming
season
,
as_usual
.
We
'll
play
Bruckner
's
Fifth_Symphony
in
the
original
version
,
and
Mahler
's
Seventh
-
the_least
accessible
,
known
,
and
played
of
Mahler
's
works
.
My
Pittsburghers
have
become
real
addicts
to
Mahler
and
Bruckner
''
.
He
added
that
he
also
stresses
the
works
of
these
favorite
masters
on_tour
,
especially
Mahler
's
First
and
Fourth
symphonies
,
and
Das_Lied_von_der_Erde
,
and
Bruckner
's
Sixth
-
which
is
rarely
played
-
and
Seventh
.
Bruckner
's
Eighth
he
refers
to
as
``
my
travel
symphony
''
.
He
recalled
that
in
California
after
a
critic
had
attacked
him
for
``
still
trying
to
sell
Bruckner
to
the
Americans
''
,
the
public
's
response
at
the
next
concert
was
a
standing_ovation
.
``
Now
that
Bruno_Walter
is
virtually
in
retirement
and
my
dear
friend
Dimitri_Mitropoulos
is
no_longer
with
us
,
I
am
probably
the
only
one
-
with
the
possible
exception
of
Leonard_Bernstein
-
who
has
this
special
affinity
for
and
champions
the
works
of
Bruckner
and
Mahler
''
.
Since
he
introduces
so_much
modern
music
,
I
could
not
resist
asking
how
he
felt
about
it
.
``
There
was
always
and
at_all_times
a
contemporary
music
and
it
expresses
the
era
in_which
it
was
created
.
But
I
usually
stick_to
the
old
phrase
:
'
Ich
habe
ein
Amt
,
aber
keine
Meinung
(
I
hold
an
office
,
but
I
do
not
feel
entitled
to
have
an
opinion
)
.
I
consider
it
to
be
my
job
to
expose
the
public
to
what
is
being
written
today
''
.
With
all
his
musical
activities
,
did
he
have
the
time
and
inclination
to
do
anything
else
?
He
had
just
paid
a
brief
visit
to
the
Frick_Collection
to
admire
his
favorite
paintings
by
Rembrandt
and
Franz_Hals
.
He
was
not
enthusiastic
over
the
newly
acquired
Claude_Lorrain
,
but
reminisced
with
pleasure
over
a
Poussin
exhibit
he
had
been
able
to
see
in
Paris
a
year
ago
.
And_how
did
he
feel
about
modern
art
?
Again
Steinberg
was
cautious
and
replied
with
a
smile
that
he
was
not
exposed
to_it
enough
to
hazard
comments
.
``
As
my
wife
puts
it
''
,
he
said
,
again
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
,
``
all
you
know
is
your
music
.
But
after_all
,
you
never
learned
anything
else
''
!
What
did
he
do
for
relaxation
?
Like
his
late
colleague
,
Mitropoulos
,
he
reads
mystery_stories
,
in_particular
Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle
.
He
cited
Heine
and
Stendhal
as
favorites
in
literature
.
But
his
prime
interest
,
apart
from
music
,
he
insisted
seriously
,
was
his
family
-
his
wife
,
daughter
and
son
.
At
the
moment
he
was
excited
about
his
son
's
having
received
the
Prix
de
Rome
in
archaeology
and
was
looking_forward
to
being
present
this
summer
at
the
excavation
of
an
Etruscan
tomb
.
``
Both
children
are
musical
and
my
wife
is
a
music_lover
of
unfailing
instinct
and
judgment
''
.
``
Is
the
attitude
of
German
youth
comparable_to
that
of
''
the
angry
young_men
'
of
England
''
?
was
the
topic
for
a
round-table
discussion
at
the
Bayerische_Rundfunk
in
Munich
.
I
was
chairman
,
the
only
not
youthful
participant
.
Since
attack
serves
to
stimulate
interest
in
broadcasts
,
I
added
to
my
opening
statement
a
sentence
in_which
I
claimed
that
German
youth
seemed
to
lack
the
enthusiasm
which
is
a
necessary
ingredient
of
anger
,
and
might
be
classified
as
uninterested
and
bored
rather_than
angry
.
I
was
far
from
convinced
of
the
truth
of
my
statement
,
but
could
not
think_of
anything
that
might
evoke
responses
more_quickly
.
``
It
is
easy
for
you
to
talk
''
;
countered
a
twenty
year
old
law_student
,
``
you
travel
around
the
world
.
We
would
like
to
do
that
too
''
.
``
But
you
want
a
job
guaranteed
when
you
return
''
,
I
continued
my
attack
.
``
You
must
have
some
security
''
,
said
a
young
clerk
.
When
I
mentioned
that
for
my
first
long
voyage
I
did
not
even
have
the
money
for
the
return
fare
,
but
had
trusted
to
luck
that
I
would
earn
a
sufficient
amount
,
the
young
people
looked
at
me
doubtingly
.
One
girl
expressed
what
was
obviously
in
their
minds
.
``
Would
you
advise
us
to
act
the
same
way
?
You
might
have
failed
.
I
think
it
is
rather
foolhardy
to
trust
to
luck
''
.
Others
mentioned
that
I
might
have
had
to
ask
friends
or
even
strangers
for
help
and
that
to
be
stranded
in_a_foreign_country
without
sufficient
funds
did
not
contribute
to
international
understanding
.
The
debate
needed
no
additional
controversy
and
soon
I
could
ask
each
individually
what
he
expected
from
life
,
what
his
hopes
were
and
what
his
fears
.
Though
the
four
boys
and
two
girls
,
the
youngest
nineteen
years
of_age
,
the
oldest
twenty-four
,
came
from
varying
backgrounds
and
had
different
professional
and
personal
interests
,
there
was
surprising
agreement
among
them
.
What
they
wished
for
most
was
security
;
what
they
feared
most
was
war
or
political
instability
in
their
own
country
.
The
ideal
home
,
they
agreed
,
would
be
a
small
private
house
or
a
city
apartment
of
four
to
five
rooms
,
just
enough
for
a
family
consisting_of
husband
,
wife
,
and
two
children
.
No
one
wanted
a
larger
family
or
no
children
,
and
none
hoped_for
a
castle
or
said
that
living
in
less
settled
circumstances
would
be
satisfactory
.
All
expressed
interest
in
world
affairs
but
no
one
offered
to
make
any
sacrifices
to
satisfy
this
interest
.
