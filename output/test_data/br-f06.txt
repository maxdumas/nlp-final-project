Are
you
retiring
now
?
If
so
,
are
you
saying
,
``
Where
did
the
last
few
years
go
?
How
did
I
get
to
be
sixty-five
so
fast
?
What
do
I
do
now
''
?
Yes
,
retirement
seems
to
creep
upon
you
suddenly
.
Somehow
we
old-timers
never
figured
we
would
ever
retire
.
We
always
thought
we
would
die
with
our
boots
on
.
Out_of_the_blue
comes
talk
of
pension
plans
.
Compulsory
retirement
at
sixty-five
looms
on
our
horizon
.
Still
,
it
seems
in
the
far
future
.
Suddenly
,
one_day
,
up
it
pops
!
Sixty-five
years
and
you
've
had_it
!
So
,
now
what
?
Oh
sure
!
You
've
thought_about
it
before
in
a
hazy
sort_of
way
.
But
!
It
never
seemed
real
;
never
seemed
as
if
it
could
happen
to
you
;
only
to
the
other
fellow
.
Now
!
Here
it
is
!
How
am
I
going_to
live
?
What
am
I
going_to
do
?
Where
do
I
go
from
here
?
A
great
many
retired
people
are
the
so-called
white
collar
workers
.
Are
you
one
of
these
?
If
so
,
you
are
of
the
old_school
.
You
are
conscientious
,
hard
working
,
honest
,
accurate
,
a
good
penman
,
and
a
stickler
for
a
job
well
done
,
with
no
loose_ends
.
Everything
must
balance
to
the
last
penny
.
Also
you
can
spell
,
without
consulting
a
dictionary
for
every_other
word
.
You
never
are
late
for
work
and
seldom
absent
.
Actually
,
you
can
take
no
special
credit
for
this
.
It
is
the
way
you
were
taught
and
your
way_of_life
.
All
this
is
standard
equipment
for
a
man
of
your
day
;
your
stock
in
trade
;
your
livelihood
.
However
,
the
last
few
years
of
your
life
,
things
seem
to
be
changing
.
Your
way
does
n't
seem
to
be
so
darned
important
any_more
.
You
realize
you
are
getting_in
the
old
fogy
class
.
To
put
it
bluntly
,
you
are
getting
out-moded
.
What
's
happened
?
The
answer
is
a
new
era
.
Now
,
looming
on
the
horizon
are
such
things
as
estimated
totals
,
calculated
risks
and
I._B._M.
machines
.
The
Planning_Dept.
comes
into
existence
.
All
sorts
of
plans
come_to_life
.
This
is
followed
by
a
boom
in
conferences
.
Yes
sir
!
Conferences
become
very
popular
.
When
a
plan
burst
its
seams
,
hasty
conferences
supply
the
necessary
patch
,
and
life
goes
merrily
on
.
That
's
called
progress
!
The
new
way_of_life
!
Let
's
face
it
!
You
had
your
day
and
it
was
a
good_day
.
Let
this
generation
have
theirs
.
Time
marches_on
!
Well
,
to
get_back
to
the
problem
of
retirement
.
Every
retiring
person
has
a
different
situation
facing
him
.
Some
have
plenty
of
money
-
some
have
very
little
money
.
Some
are
blest
with
an
abundance
of
good_health
-
some
are
in
poor
health
and
many
are
invalids
.
Some
have
lovely
homes
-
some
live
in
small
apartments
.
Some
have
beautiful
gardens
-
some
not
even
a
blade
of
grass
.
Some
have
serenity
of
mind
,
the
ability
to
accept
what
they
have
,
and
make
the
most
of
it
(
a
wonderful
gift
to
have
,
believe
me
)
-
some
see
only
darkness
,
the
bitter
side
of
everything
.
Well
,
whatever
you
have
,
that
's
it
!
You
've
got_to
learn
to
live
with_it
.
Now
!
The
question
is
``
How
are
you
going_to
live
with_it
''
?
You
can
sit_back
and
moan
and
bewail
your
lot
.
Yes
!
You
can
do
this
.
But
,
if
you
do
,
your
life
will
be
just
one
thing
-
unhappiness
-
complete
and
unabridged
.
It
seems
to
me
,
the
first
thing
you
've
got_to
do
,
to
be
happy
,
is
to
face_up
to
your
problems
,
no_matter
what
they
may
be
.
Make_up
your
mind
to
pool
your
resources
and
get
the_most
out
of
your
remaining
years
of
life
.
One
thing
,
I
am
sure
of
,
you
must
get
an
interest
in
life
.
You
've
got_to
do
something
.
Many_of
you
will
say
,
``
Well
,
what
can
I
do
''
?
Believe
me
!
There
are
many
,
many
things
to
do
.
Find_out
what
you
like
to
do
most
and
really
give_it_a_whirl
.
If
you
can
n't
think_of
a
thing
to
do
,
try
something
-
anything
.
Maybe
you
will
surprise
yourself
.
True
!
We
are
not
all
great
artists
.
I
,
frankly
,
can
n't
draw
a
straight_line
.
Maybe
you
are
not
that
gifted
either
,
but
how
about
puttering_around
with
the
old
paints
?
You
may
amaze
yourself
and
acquire
a
real
knack
for
it
.
Anyway
,
I
'll
bet
you
have
a_lot_of
fun
.
Do
you
like
to
sew
?
Does
making
your
own
clothes
or
even
doll
clothes
,
interest
you
?
Do
you
love
to
run_up
a
hem
,
sew
on
buttons
,
make
neat
buttonholes
?
If
you
do
,
go_to_it
.
There
is
always
a
market
for
this
line_of_work
.
Some
women
can
sit
and
sew
,
crochet
,
tat
or
knit
by_the_hour
,
and
look
calm
and
relaxed
and
turn_out
beautiful
work
.
Where
sewing
is_concerned
,
I
'm
a
total
loss
.
When
you
see
a
needle
in
my
hands
you
will
know
the
family
buttons
have
fallen_off
and
I
have_to
sew
them
back
on
,
or
get_out
the
safety_pins
.
Then_again
,
there
's
always
that
lovely
old
pastime
of
hooking
or
braiding
rugs
.
Not
for
me
,
but
perhaps
just
the
thing
for
you
.
Well
!
How
's
about
mosaic
tile
,
ceramics
or
similar
arts
and
crafts
?
Some
people
love
to
crack
tile
and
it
's
amazing
what
beautiful
designs
they
come_up
with
as
a
result
of
their
cracking
good
time
.
How
about
the
art
of
cooking
?
Do
you
yearn
to
make
cakes
and
pies
,
or
special
cookies
and
candies
?
There
is
always
an
open
market
for
this
sort_of
delicacy
,
in_spite_of
low
calorie
diets
,
cottage_cheese
and
hands-off-all-sweets
to_the_contrary
.
Some
people
can
carve
most
anything
out
of
a_piece
of
wood
.
Some
make
beautiful
chairs
,
cabinets
,
chests
,
doll
houses
,
etc.
.
Perhaps
you
could
n't
do
that
but
have
you
ever
tried
to
see
what
you
could
do
with
a
hunk
of
wood
?
Outside
of
cutting
your
fingers
,
maybe
you
would
come_up
with
nothing
at_all
,
but
then_again
,
you
might
turn_out
some
dandy
little
gadgets
.
Some
women
get
a
real
thrill
out
of
housework
.
They
love
to
dust
,
scrub
,
polish
,
wax
floors
,
move
the
furniture
around
from_place_to_place
,
take_down
the
curtains
,
put_up
new
ones
and
have
themselves
a
real
ball
.
Maybe
that
's
your
forte
.
It
certainly
is
n't
mine
.
I
can
look
at
furniture
in
one
spot
year
in
and
year
out
and
really
feel
for
sure
that
's
where
it
belongs
.
Perhaps
you
would
like
to
become
a
writer
.
This
gives
you
a
wide
and
varied
choice
.
Will
it
be
short_stories
,
fiction
,
nonfiction
,
biography
,
poetry
,
children
's
stories
,
or
even
a
book
if
you
are
really
ambitious
?
Ever
since
I
was
a
child
,
I
have
always
had
a
yen
to
try
my
hand
at
writing
.
If
you
do
decide
to
write
,
you
will
soon
become
acquainted_with
rejection
slips
and
dejection
.
Do
n't
be
discouraged
!
This
is
just
being
a
normal
writer
.
Just
let
the
rejection
slips
fall
where
they
may
,
and
keep_on
plugging
,
and
finally
you
will
make
the
grade
.
Few
new
writers
have
their
first
story
accepted
,
so
they
tell
me
.
But
,
it
could
happen
,
and
it
may
happen
to
you
.
Then
there
's
always
hobbies
,
collecting
stamps
,
coins
,
timetables
,
salt
and
pepper
shakers
,
elephants
,
dogs
,
dolls
,
shells
,
or
shall
we
just
say
collecting
anything
your
heart
desires
?
I
can
hear
some
of
you
folks
protesting
.
You
say
,
``
But
it
costs
a_lot_of
money
to
have
a
hobby
.
I
have
n't
got
that
kind_of
money
''
.
True
!
It
does
cost
a_lot_of
money
for
most
hobbies
but
there
are
hobbies
that
are
for_free
.
How
about
a
rock
collection
,
or
a
collection
of
leaves
from
different
trees
or
shrubs
and
in
different
colors
?
Then
,
take
flowers
.
They
are
many
and
varied
.
Also
,
there
's
scrap
books
,
collecting
newspaper
pictures
and
clippings
,
or
any
items
of
interest
to
you
.
It
's
getting
interested
in
something
that
counts
.
As
for
me
,
I
am
holding
in
reserve
two
huge
puzzles
(
I
love
puzzles
)
to
put_together
when
time
hangs
heavy
on
my
hands
.
So_far
,
the
covers
have
never
been
off
the
boxes
.
I
just
do
n't
have
time
to
do
half
the
things
I
want
to
do
now
.
So
in
closing
,
fellow
retired
members
,
I
advise
you
to
make
the
most
of
each_day
,
enjoy
each
one
to
the
n't
h
degree
.
Travel
,
if
you
can
.
Keep
occupied
to_the_point
you
are
not
bored
with
life
and
you
will
truly
find
these
final
days
and
years
of
your
lives
to
be
sunshine
sweet
.
Good_Luck
!
To
one
and
all
-
Good_Days
ahead
!
An
important
criterion
of
maturity
is
creativity
.
The
mature
person
is
creative
.
What
does_it
mean
to
be
creative
,
a
term
we
hear
with
increasing
frequency
these
days
?
When
we
turn_to
Noah_Webster
we
find
him
helpful
as_usual
.
``
To
be
creative
is
to
have
the
ability
to
cause
to
exist
-
to
produce
where
nothing
was
before
-
to
bring_forth
an
original
production
of
human
intelligence
or
power
''
.
We
are
creative
,
it
seems
,
when
we
produce
something
which
has
not
previously
existed
.
Thus
creativity
may
run
all_the_way
from
making
a
cake
,
building
a
chicken_coop
,
or
producing
a
book
,
to
founding
a
business
,
creating
a
League
of
Nations
or
,
developing
a
mature
character
.
All
living
creatures
from
the
lowest
form
of
insect
or
animal
life
evidence
the
power
of
creativity
,
if
it
is
only
to
reproduce
a
form
like
their
own
.
While
man
shares
this
procreative
function
with
all
his
predecessors
in
the
evolutionary
process
,
he
is
the
only
animal
with
a
true
non-instinctive
and
conscious
creative
ability
.
An
animal
,
bird
or
insect
creates
either
a
burrow
,
or
nest
or
hive
in
unending
sameness
according
to
specie
.
Man
's
great
superiority
over
these
evolutionary
forbears
is
in
the
development
of
his
imagination
.
This
gives
him
the
power
to
form
in
his
mind
new
image
combinations
of
old
memories
,
ideas
and
experiences
and
to
project
them
outside
of
himself
into
his
environment
in
new
and
ever-changing
forms
.
It
has
been
truly
said
that
anything
man
can
imagine
he
can
produce
or
create
by
projecting
this
inner
image
into
its
counterpart
in
the
objective
world
.
In
our
own
time
we
have
seen
the_most
fantastic
imagery
of
a
Jules_Verne
come
into
actuality
.
The
vision
of
a
Lord_Tennyson
expressed
in
a
poem
100
years
ago
took
visible
form
over
London
in_the_air
blitzes
of
1941
.
In_fact
all_of
our
civilized
world
is
the
resultant
of
man
's
projection
of
his
imagination
over
the
past
60
centuries
or
more
.
It
is
in_this
one
aspect
,
at_least
,
that
man
seems
to
be
made
in
the
image
of
his
Creator
.
Not_only
can
man
project
his
imagination
out
into
his
environment
in
concrete
forms
,
but
even
more
importantly
,
he
can
turn
it
inward
to
help
create
new
and
better
forms
of
himself
.
We
recognize
that
young
people
through
imaginative
mind
and
body
training
can
become
athletes
,
acrobats
,
dancers
,
musicians
and
artists
,
developing
many
potentialities
.
We
know
that
actors
can
learn
to
portray
a
wide
variety
of
character
roles
.
By
this
same
combination
of
the
will
and
the
imagination
,
each
one
of
us
can
learn
to
portray
permanently
the
kind_of
character
we
would
like
to
be
.
We
must
realize
with
Prof._Charles_Morris
in
his
The
Open_Self
that
``
Man
is
the
being
that
can
continually
remake
himself
,
the
artisan
that
is
himself
the
material
for
his
own
creation
''
.
So_far
in
history
man
has
been
too
greatly
over-occupied
with
projecting
things
into
his
environment
rather_than
first
creating
the
sort_of
person
who
can
make
the
highest
use
of
the
things
he
has
created
.
Is
not
the
present
world
crisis
a
race
between
things
we
have
created
which
can
now
destroy
us
and
between
populations
of
sufficient
wisdom
and
character
to
forestall
the
tragedy
.
Is
it
not
the
obligation
of
us
older
citizens
to
lend
our
weight
to
being
creative
on
the
character
side
and
to
hasten
our
own
maturing
process
?
Sir_Julian_Huxley
in
his
book
Uniqueness
Of
Man
makes
the
novel
point
that
just_as
man
is
unique
in
being
the
only
animal
which
requires
a
long
period
of
infancy
and
childhood
under
family
protection
,
so
is
he
the
only
animal
who
has
a
long
period
after
the
decline
of
his
procreativity
.
