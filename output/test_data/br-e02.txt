The
most
beautiful
bed
of
pansies
I
've
seen
was
in
a
South_Dakota
yard
on
a
sizzling
day
.
Pansies
are
supposed
to
like
it
cool
,
but
those
great
velvety
flowers
were
healthy
and
perky
in
the
glaring
sun
.
I
sought_out
the
gardener
and
asked
him
what
he
did
to
produce
such
beauties
in
that
weather
.
He
seemed
puzzled
by
my
question
.
``
I
just
love
them
''
,
he
said
.
The
more
I
talked
with
him
,
the
more
convinced
I
became
that
that
was
the
secret
of
their
riotous
blooming
.
Of_course
his
love
was
expressed
in
intelligent
care
.
He
planted
the
pansy
seeds
himself
,
buying
them
from
a
pansy
specialist
.
These
specialists
,
I
learned
,
have
done
a
great_deal
of
work
to
improve
the
size
and
health
of
the
plants
and
the
resulting
flowers
.
Their
seeds
produce
vigorous
blooming
plants
half
again
the
size
of
the
unimproved
strains
.
I
asked
him
if
he
took
seeds
from
his
own
plants
.
Occasionally
,
when
he
had
an
unusual
flower
that
he
wanted
more
of
he
did
;
but
pansy
seeds
,
he
told
me
,
soon
``
run_down
''
.
It
's
best
to
buy
them
fresh
from
a
dealer
who
is
working
to
improve
them
.
His
soil
was
``
nothing
special
''
,
just
prairie
land
,
but
he
had
harrowed
in
compost
until
it
was
loose
,
spongy
and
brown
black
.
I
fingered
it
and
had
the
feeling
of
adequacy
that
comes_with
the
right
texture
,
tilth
and
body
.
It
is
n't
easy
to
describe
it
,
but
every
gardener
knows
it
when
his
fingers
touch
such
soil
.
Nothing
is
easier
to
grow
from
seed
than
pansies
.
They
germinate
quickly
,
the
tiny
plants
appearing
in
a
week
,
and
grow
along
lustily
.
It
does
n't
really
matter
which
month
of
the
year
you
sow
them
,
but
they
germinate
best
when
they
have
a
wide
variation
of
temperature
,
very
warm
followed
by
cool
in
the
same
24
hours
.
I
like
to
make
a
seedbed
right
in
the
open
,
though
many
people
start
them
successfully
in
cold_frames
.
Pansies
do
n't
have
to
be
coddled
;
they
'd
rather
have
things
rugged
,
with
only
moderate
protection
on
the
coldest
days
.
If
you
do
use
a
cold_frame
be
sure
that
its
ventilation
is
adequate
.
For
my
seedbed
I
use
good
garden
soil
with
a
little
sand
added
to
encourage
rooting
.
I
dig
it
,
rake
it
smooth
,
sow
the
seeds
and
wet
them
down
with
a
fog
spray
.
Then
I
cover
the
sowing
with
a
board
.
This
keeps
it
cool
and
moist
and
protects
it
from
birds
.
Ants
carry_away
the
seeds
so
better
be
sure
that
there
are
no
ant
hills
nearby
.
When
the
first
sprinkling
of
green
appears
I
remove
the
board
.
A
light
,
porous
mulch
applied
now
keeps
the
roots
cool
and
the
soil
soft
during
these
early
days
of
growth
.
I
like
sawdust
for
this
,
or
hay
.
When
they
have
4
to
6
leaves
and
are
thrifty
little
plants
,
it
's
time
to
set
them
out
where
they
are
to
remain
.
Every
time
you
transplant
a
pansy
you
cause
its
flowers
to
become
smaller
.
The
moral
is
:
do
n't
transplant
it
any
oftener
than
you
must
.
As_soon_as
they
are
large
enough
to
move
,
I
put
mine
9
inches
apart
where
they
are
to
bloom
.
I
put
a
little
scoop
of
pulverized
phosphate
rock
or
steamed
bone_meal
into
each
hole
with
the
plant
.
That
encourages
rooting
,
and
the
better
developed
the
roots
,
the
larger
and
more
plentiful
the
flowers
.
Pansies
are
gluttons
.
I
doubt
if
it
is
possible
to
overfeed
them
.
I
spade
lots
of
compost
into
their
bed
;
lacking
that
,
decayed
manure
spread_over
the
bed
is
fine
.
One
year
I
simply
set
the
plants
in
the
remains
of
a
compost
pile
,
to
which
a_little
sand
had
been
added
,
and
I
had
the
most
beautiful
pansies
in
my
,
or
any
of
my
neighbors
'
experience
.
In_addition
to
the
rich
soil
they
benefit
by
feedings
of
manure
water
every_other
week
,
diluted
to
the
color
of
weak
tea
.
As
a
substitute
for
this
,
organic
fertilizer
dissolved
in
water
to
half
the
strength
in
the
directions
,
may
be
used
.
They
need
mulch
.
We
put
a
light
mulch
over
the
seedlings
;
now
we
must
use
a
heavy
one
.
Three
inches
of
porous
material
will
do
a
good
job
of
keeping
weeds
down
and
the
soil
moist
and
cool
.
When
winter
comes
be
ready
with
additional
mulch
.
I
like
hay
for
this
and
apply
it
so_that
only
the
tops
of
the
plants
show
right
after
a
good
frost
.
That
keeps_in
the
cold
,
retains
moisture
and
prevents
the
heaving
of
alternate
freezing
and
thawing
.
Do
n't
miss
the
pansies
that
appear
from_time_to_time
through
the
winter
.
Whenever
there
is
a
thaw
or
a_few
sunny
days
,
you
'll
be
likely
to
find
a
brave
little
blossom
or
two
.
If
those
are
n't
enough
for
you
,
why
not
grow
some
just
for
winter
blooming
?
The
pansies
I
cherished
most
bloomed
for
me
in
February
during
a
particularly
cold
winter
.
I
started
the
seed
in
a
flat
in
June
and
set_out
the
little
pansies
in
a
cold_frame
.
(
An
unheated
greenhouse
would
have
been
better
,
if
I
had
had
one
.
)
The
plants
took
zero
nights
in
their
stride
,
with
nothing
but
a
mat
of
straw
over
the
glass
to
protect
them
.
In
response
to
the
lengthening
days
of
February
they
budded
,
then
bloomed
their
4
-
inch
velvety
flowers
.
That
cold_frame
was
my
morale_builder
;
its
mass
of
bright
bloom
set
in
a
border
of
snow
made
my
spirits
rise
every
time
I
looked
at
it
.
Like
strawberries
in
December
,
pansies
are
far
more
exciting
in
February
than
in
May
.
Try
that
late
winter
pickup
when
you
are
so
tired_of
cold
and
snow
that
you
feel
you
just
can't
take
another
day
of
it
.
The
day
will
come
,
in
midsummer
,
when
you
find
your
plants
becoming
``
leggy
''
,
running
to
tall-growing
foliage
at
the
expense
of
blossoms
.
Try
pegging_down
each
separate
branch
to
the
earth
,
using
a
bobby_pin
to
hold
it
there
.
Pick
the
flowers
,
keep
the
soil
dampened
,
and
each
of
the
pegged-down
branches
will
take
root
and
become
a
little
plant
and
go_on
blooming
for
the
rest
of
the
season
.
As_soon_as
an
experimental
tug
assures
you
that
roots
have
taken_over
,
cut
it
off
from
the
mother
plant
.
A
second
and
also
good
practice
is
to
shear
off
the
tops
,
leaving
an
inch
high
stub
with
just
a
leaf
or
two
on
each
branch
.
These
cut-down
plants
will
bud
and
blossom
in
record
time
and
will
behave
just
as
they
did
in
early
spring
.
I
like
to
shear
half
my
plants
at_a_time
,
leaving
one
half
of
them
to
blossom
while
the
second_half
is
getting_started
on
its
new
round
of
blooming
.
Probably
no
one
needs
to
tell
you
that
the
way
to
stop
all
bloom
is
to
let
the
blossoms
go
to
seed
.
Nature
's
aim
,
different
from
ours
,
is
to
provide
for
the
coming
generation
.
That
done
,
her
work
is
accomplished
and
she
ignores
the
plant
.
Here
is
a
word_of_advice
when
you
go
shopping
for
your
pansy
seeds
.
Go_to
a
reputable
grower
,
preferably
a
pansy
specialist
.
It
is
no
harder
to
raise
big
,
healthy
,
blooming
plants
than
weak
,
sickly
little
things
;
in_fact
it
is
easier
.
But
you
will
never
get
better
flowers
than
the
seed
you
grow
.
Many
people
think
that
pansies
last
only
a_few
weeks
,
then
their
period
of
growth
and
bloom
is
over
.
That
is
not
true
.
If
the
plants
are
cared
for
and
protected
over
the
winter
,
the
second
year
is
more
prolific
than
the
first
.
Would
you
like
to
grow
exhibition
pansies
?
Remove
about
half
the
branches
from
each
plant
,
leaving
only
the
strongest
with
the
largest
buds
.
The
flowers
will
be
huge
.
Pansies
have
character
.
They
stick_to
their
principles
,
insist
upon
their
due
,
but
grow
and
bloom
with
dependable
regularity
if
given
it
.
Treat
them
right
and
they
'll
make
a
showing
every_month
in
the
year
except
the
frigid
ones
.
Give
them
food
,
some
shade
,
mulch
,
water
and
more
food
,
and
they
'll
repay
your
solicitude
with
beauty
.
A
salad
with
greens
and
tomato
is
a
popular
and
wonderfully
healthful
addition
to
a
meal
,
but
add
an
avocado
and
you
have
something
really
special
.
This
delightful
tropical
fruit
has
become
well-known
in
the
past
thirty
years
because
modern
transportation
methods
have
made
it
possible
to
ship
avocado
anywhere
in
the
United_States
.
It
has
a
great
many
assets
to
recommend
it
and
if
you
have
n't
made
avocado
a
part
of
your
diet
yet
,
you
really
should
.
You
will
find
that
avocado
is
unlike
any
other
fruit
you
have
ever
tasted
.
It
is
roughly
shaped
like
a
large
pear
,
and
when
properly
ripened
,
its
dark
green
skin
covers
a
meaty
,
melon
like
pulp
that
has
about
the
consistency
of
a
ripe
Bartlett_pear
,
but
oily
.
The
avocado
should
have
a
``
give
''
to
it
,
as
you
hold
it
,
when
it
is
ripe
.
The
flavor
is
neither
sweet
,
like
a
pear
,
nor
tart
like
an
orange
;
it
is
subtle
and
rather
bland
,
nut
like
.
It
is
a
flavor
that
might
take
a_little
getting
used_to
-
not
because
it
is
unpleasant
,
but
because
the
flavor
is
hard
to
define
in
the
light
of
our
experience
with
other
fruits
.
Sometimes
it
takes
several
``
eatings
''
of
avocado
to
catch
that
delightful
quality
in
taste
that
has
made
it
such
a
favorite
throughout
the
world
.
Once
you
become
an
avocado
fan
,
you
will
look_forward
to
the
season
each_year
with
eager
anticipation
.
Today
,
refrigerated
carriers
have
made
the
shipping
of
avocados
possible
to
any
place
in
the
world
.
The
fruit
is
allowed
to
mature
on
the
tree
,
but
it
is
still
firm
at
this
point
.
It
is
brought
to
packing_houses
,
cleaned
and
graded
as
to
size
and
quality
,
and
packed
in
protective
excelsior
.
The
fruit
is
then
cooled
to
42
`
F.
,
a
temperature
at
which
it
lapses
into
a
sort_of
dormant
state
.
This
cooling
does
not
change
the
avocado
in
any
way
,
it
just
delays
the
natural
softening
of
the
fruit
until
a
grove
like
temperature
(
room_temperature
)
is
restored
.
This
happens
on
the
grocer
's
shelf
or
in
your
kitchen
.
One
of
the
most
attractive
things
about
avocados
is
that
they
do
not
require
processing
of
any
kind
.
There
is
no
dyeing
or
waxing
or
gassing
needed
.
If
the
temperature
is
controlled
properly
,
the
avocado
will
delay
its
ripening
until
needed
.
And
unlike
other
fruits
,
one
cannot
eat
the
skin
of
the
avocado
.
It
is
thick
,
much
like
an
egg_plant
's
skin
,
so
that
poison
sprays
,
if
they
are
used
,
present
no
hazard
to
the
consumer
.
Good
taste
and
versatility
,
plus
safety
from
spray
poisons
would
be
enough
to
recommend
the
frequent
use
of
such
a
fruit
,
even
if
its
nutritional
values
were
limited
.
Avocados
,
however
,
are
very
rich_in
nutrients
.
Their
main
asset
is
an
abundance
of
unsaturated
fatty_acids
,
so
necessary
for
maintaining
the
good_health
of
the
circulatory_system
.
Aside
from
this
,
the
average
portion
contains
some
protein
,
an
appreciable
amount
of
vitamins
and
C
-
about
one-tenth
of
the
minimum
daily
requirement
,
and
about
a
third
of
the
official
vitamin_E
requirement
.
The
B_vitamins
are
well
represented
,
especially
thiamin
and
riboflavin
.
Calcium
,
phosphorus
and
iron
are
present
in
worthwhile
amounts
,
and
eleven
other
minerals
also
have
been
found
in
varying
trace
amounts
.
None
of
these
values
is
destroyed
,
not
significantly
altered
by
refrigeration
storage
.
Dr._Wilson_C._Grant
,
of
the
Veterans_'_Administration_Hospital
,
Coral_Gables
,
Florida
,
and
the
University_of_Miami_School_of_Medicine
,
set_out
to
discover
if
avocados
,
because
of
their
high
content
of
unsaturated
fatty_acids
,
would
reduce
the
cholesterol
of
the
blood
in
selected
patients
.
The
study
comprised
16
male
patients
,
ranging
in
age
from
27
to
72
.
They
were
put
on
control
diets
to
determine
as
accurately
as
possible
,
the
normal
cholesterol
level
of
their
blood
.
Then
they
were
given
1_2
to
1
-
1_2
avocados
per
day
as
a
substitute
for
part
of
their
dietary
fat
consumption
.
