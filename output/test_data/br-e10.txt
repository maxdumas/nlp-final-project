The
average
reader
of_this
magazine
owns
more_than
one
gun
(
we
ran
a
survey
to
find_out
)
but
he
's
always
on
the
lookout
for
new
and
better
arms
.
He
's
more_than
a
reader
of
outdoor
articles
;
he
's
a
real
hunter
and
shooter
,
eager
to
improve
his
sport
.
Well
,
if
you
're
that
kind_of
sportsman
we
're
here
to
help
you
.
You
've
probably
given
a_lot_of
Christmas-season
thought
to
the
guns
in
your
rack
,
but
it
's
not
easy
to
decide
on
a
new
one
.
You
still
have
time
to
drop
a_few
hints
about
the
gifts
you
'd
appreciate
most
;
the
time
to
decide
on
them
is
now
.
As
a
Christmas
service
,
I
've
taken
a
close
look
at
this
year
's
crop
of
new
models
.
Here
they
are
,
with
my
comments
and
judgments
.
Read
on
,
take
your
pick
-
and
start
dropping
those
hints
.
First
on
my
own
list
would
be
two
arms
-
a
rifle
and
a
handgun
-
that
qualify
as
new
in
the
strictest
sense
.
For
me
,
a
changed
barrel
length
or
an
improved
stock
does
n't
constitute
a
truly
new
design
.
Such
modifications
are
all
for
the
best
but
it
takes
something
as
different
as
a
Deerstalker
or
a
Jet
to
change
arms-making
concepts
.
Bill_Ruger
's
long-awaited
Deerstalker
(
under
$
110
)
is
a
new
rifle
action
in
a
caliber
that
upsets
all
the
modern
theory
of
high-velocity
fans
;
it
's
a
short
,
light
,
quick-handling
,
fast-firing
little
timber
gun
designed
to
push
a
heavy
slug
at
modest
velocity
but
with
lots_of
killing
power
and
ample
range
for
our
most
popular
big_game
-
whitetail
.
Ruger
reports
that
on
his
recent
African
safari
the
little
.44
Magnum
cartridge
was
a
real
work
horse
.
Small
antelope
were
generally
grassed
with
one_shot
,
and
the
.44
Magnum
carbine
also
bagged
reedbuck
,
kob
and
wart
hog
with
deadly
efficiency
;
these
are
fairly
large
,
tough
animals
.
The
deadliness
of
the
.44
Magnum
in
a
rifle
comes
as
no
surprise
to
me
.
At_least
five
years
ago
,
Tom_Robinson
of
Marlin
made_up
an
over
/
under
double
rifle
for
me
in_this
caliber
,
using
the
now
defunct
Model
90
action
in
20
-
gauge
size
.
After
figuring_out
how
to
regulate
the
barrels
so_that
they
shot
to
the
same
point
of
impact
,
we
fired
this
little
20
-
inch-barrel
job
on
my
home_range
and
in
Marlin
's
underground
test
gallery
.
We
quickly
ran_into
the
same
trouble
that
plagued
Bill_Ruger
in
his
first
experiments
:
Three
or
four
bullets
would
be
placed
well
in
a
six-inch
bull
at
100
yards
and_then
,
unaccountably
,
one
could
stray
far
out
of
the
group
.
Ruger
learned
that
this
was
because
the
higher
velocity
achieved
in
a
long
barrel
was
upsetting
the
shape
of
the
unjacketed
revolver
bullet
.
The
new
,
jacketed
slug
in
.44
Magnum
corrected
this
.
But
even
without
jacketed
bullets
,
I
had
enough
faith
in
my
double
to
take
it
on
an
opening-day
deer
hunt
that
first
year
.
Within
half
an
hour
I
jumped
a
six-point
buck
that
hop-skipped
through
a
rhododendron
thicket
,
and
I
caught
him
just
behind
the
left
foreleg
at
60
yards
.
He
moved
only
about
30
feet
after
the
240
-
grain
slug
hit
him
-
and
this
was
after
the
bullet
had
passed_through
a
sapling
.
Three
more
deer
have
fallen
to
this
same
gun
,
and
all
were
one-shot
kills
.
My
double
was
made
with
standard-weight
revolver
barrels
(
before
cutting
to
revolver
length
)
,
and
although
it
compares
well
in_other_respects
,
it
's
considerably
heavier
than
the
Deerstalker
,
which
only
scales
about
6
-
1
2
pounds
.
If
ever
a
rifle
met
the
needs
of
the
whitetail
hunter
,
this
is
it
.
The
Deerstalker
points
with
the
ease
,
speed
and
precision
of
a
fine
imported
double
shotgun
,
and
its
trigger
pull
is
light
and
sharp
.
The
240
-
grain
bullet
leaves
the
muzzle
at
1850
fps
,
which
gives
it
all
the
smash
needed
at
woods
ranges
.
With
five
shots
at
the
immediate
command
of
the
hunter
's
trigger
finger
,
the
gun
and
load
are
a
deadly
combination
.
The
second
really
new
development
this
year
was
a
revolver
handling
a
different
sort_of
varmint
load
-
the
.22
Remington_Jet
Magnum
Center_Fire
.
At_present
it
's
available
in
one
model
,
the
fine
and
familiar
Smith
+
Wesson
Magnum
revolver
(
about
$
110
)
,
long
a
top-quality
handgun
among
target
arms
.
The
velocity
of_this
.22
-
caliber
,
40
-
grain
bullet
is
rated
at
a
very
hot
2460
fps
,
and
it
's
the
flattest
shooting
of
any
revolver
cartridge
,
with
a
mid-range
rise
of
about
an
inch
over
a
100
-
yard
range
.
This
is
a
varmint
load
,
pure_and_simple
;
it
's
much
too
explosive
for
small
edible
game
.
It
can
cut
a
red_squirrel
neatly
in
two
or
burst
a
crow
into
a
flurry
of
feathers
.
The_most
intriguing
aspect
of
the
S
+
W
Magnum
chambered
for
the
new
Jet
is
that
it
can
also
fire
standard
.22
rim-fires
by
means
of
adapter
sleeves
in
the
chambers
.
You
may
therefore
convert
the
gun
into
a
small-game
and
plinking
arm
,
although
the
difference
in
the
point
of
impact
(
Jet
vs.
rim-fire
)
can
be
somewhat
disconcerting
.
The
accuracy
of
the
Jet
cartridge
is
fine
;
I
tested
it
in
my
scoped
S
+
W
and
it
was
good
enough
to
allow
me
to
hit
a
chuck
with
every
shot
at
100
yards
if
I
did
my
part
by
holding
the
handgun
steadily
.
The
fact
that
the
Deerstalker
and
the
Jet
were
the
only
completely
new
designs
this
year
does
n't
mean
that
1961
did
n't
see
changes
in
models
,
actions
and
calibers
.
Aside
from
the
Ruger
carbine
,
a_number_of
hunting
rifles
have
been
introduced
for_the_first_time
.
Here
are
the
brands
(
in_alphabetical_order
)
and
the
new
models
.
Newcomers
to
the
American
hunter
are
the
Browning
group
of
bolt-action
,
high-power
rifles
.
They
have
fine
FN
actions
and
a
better-than-average
finish
on
both
the
metal
and
the
stock
wood
.
Barrel
weights
vary
sensibly
with
the
various
calibers
available
,
and
these
include
the
standard
bores
(
about
$
165
)
plus
the
Magnums
(
around
$
170
)
;
the
latter
include
the
.264
,
.300
H
+
H
,
.338
,
.375
and
.458
.
Shotgun-type
rubber
recoil
pads
are
standard
on
all_of
the
Magnums
except
the
.264
.
Stock
designs
are
excellent
for
use
with
scopes
.
Colt
's
center-fire
1961
rifles
are
all
made
with
Sako
actions
,
regardless_of
caliber
.
The
.222
's
have
the
short
action
;
the
.243
and
.308
,
the
medium
action
,
and
the
.270
,
*
*
f
and
the
Magnums
,
the
long
action
(
about
$
135
for
the
Standard
Coltsman
and
$
200
for
the
Custom
version
)
.
Previously
,
FN
actions
were
used
for
the
larger
cartridges
.
High
standard
has
introduced
a
.22
auto
,
the
Sport-King
,
in
two
grades
-
field
and
special
(
less_than
$
45
and
just
over
$
45
,
respectively
)
.
It
's
a
streamlined
rifle
,
fast
and
well-made
.
Among
.22
Magnum
Rim-Fire
rifles
,
1961
's
lone
newcomer
was
the
Kodiak
Model
260
autoloader
(
around
$
60
)
.
Previously
known
as
Jefferson_Arms
,
Kodiak
has
given
this
11
-
shot
hammerless
job
an
exceptionally
fine
stock
design
,
and
the
260
is
the
first
autoloader
to
handle
.22
Magnum
rim-fires
.
Marlin
has
made
two
contributions
to
the
harvest
of
new
offerings
.
The
Model
99
(
under
$
45
)
is
a
light-weight
,
streamlined
.22
rim-fire
auto
with
a
tubular
magazine
that
holds
18
Long
Rifles
.
It
's
extremely
accurate
for
an
auto
,
and
the
test
rifle
I
tried
was
completely
trouble-free
in
functioning
.
The
989
(
about
$
40
)
is
an
even
newer
.22
auto
,
this
one
with
a
seven
-
or
12
-
shot
clip
.
Once_again
the
Mossberg
Targo
outfit
has
appeared
,
but
this
time
as
a
bolt-action
rifle-shotgun
combination
.
The
bore
is
unrifled
but
is
provided
with
an
insert
tube
which
is
rifled
and
which
,
surprisingly
,
gives
pretty
fair
accuracy
even_though
it
's
only
3
-
1
2
inches
long
.
You
can
unscrew
this
tube
and
replace
it
with
a
smoothbore
insert
for
use
with
.22
shotshells
-
to
break
the
little
Targo
clay
targets
.
A
trap
for
throwing
these
miniature
clays
fastens
to
the
barrel
so_that
the
shooter
can
throw
his
own
targets
.
A
spring
trap
for
solid
mounting
and
a
regular
hand
trap
are
also
available
.
You
can
have
your
choice
of
a
seven-shot
repeater
,
the
340
TR
(
about
$
40
)
or
a
single-shot
,
the
320
TR
(
$
10
less
)
.
The
Targo
is
a
good
outfit
for
fun
shooting
or
for
economic
wing-shooting
practice
,
but
it
's
tougher
than
it
looks
to
run_up
a
score
on
the
clay
birds
.
They
'll
travel
50
feet
or
more
when
thrown
from
the
spring
trap
but
it
's
almost
impossible
to
break
one
after
it
passes
the
35
-
foot
mark
.
The
combination
of
thin
pattern
and
very
tiny
pellets
makes
it
necessary
to
get_on
the_birds
,
right_now
!
Big
Magnum
calibers
appeared
in
the
Remington
line
for
1961
,
with
the
addition
of
the
.375
and
.458
to
the
list
of
Model
725
's
.
These
are
made
on
special
order
only
,
in
Kodiak
grade
(
about
$
310
)
,
with
integral
muzzle
brakes
and
heavy
rubber
recoil
pads
;
they
weigh
around
nine
pounds
.
A
shortened
version
of
the
highly
regarded
Remington
742
autoloader
also
appeared
in
1961
.
This
carbine
(
under
$
140
,
about
$
15
more
for
a
deluxe
grade
)
has
an
18
-
1
2
-
inch
barrel
and
was
obviously
inspired
by
the
popularity
of
last
year
's
Model
760
pump
with
a
short-barrel
.
This
design
is
hard
to
beat
for
timber
hunting
or
for
packing
in
a
saddle
scabbard
.
Presently
,
the
742
C
is
available
in
*
*
f
.
The
latest
versions
of
the
famous
Savage
Model
99
are
the
99
Featherweight
(
about
$
125
)
and
the
99
Deluxe
(
under
$
135
)
,
which
have
a
top-tang
safety
and
improved
trigger
design
.
The
replacement
of
the
slide-lock
side
safety_catch
will
make
this
lever-action
favorite
more
appealing
than
ever
since
the
new
safety
is
easier
and
faster
to
operate
.
A
fresh
crop
of
beginners
'
guns
showed_up
in
1961
,
and
they
're
good
bets
for
your
Christmas_gift
list
if
you
're
wondering
what
to
get
for
a
youngster
.
The_most
unusual
of
them
is
the
Ithaca
49
(
about
$
20
,
$
5
for
a
saddle
scabbard
)
-
a
lever-action
single-shot
patterned
after
the
famous
Winchester
lever-action
and
featuring
the
Western
look
.
Because
of
its
traditional
lines
,
it
probably
has
more
kid
appeal
than
any
other
model
.
The
action
is
a
drop-block
,
handling
all
the
standard
.22
rim-fires
.
Marlin
's
latest
is
also
designed
for
the
beginning
shooter
,
although
it
's
a
full-sized
rifle
with
plenty
of
barrel
weight
and
ample
stock
.
This
is
the
Model
122
(
about
$
20
)
;
it
's
a
single-shot
bolt-action
with
an
automatic
safety
-
i.
e.
,
the
safety
goes_on
every
time
the
bolt
is_lifted
and
the
gun
cocked
for
the
next
shot
.
Stock
design
is
excellent
,
and
this
model
is
a
good
first
gun
.
Another
boy
's
model
is
the
.22
single-shot
Remington
514
C
(
around
$
20
)
,
which
comes_with
a
21
-
inch
barrel
and
a
short
-
12
-
1
2
-
inch
-
stock
;
it
's
just_right
for
a
boy
of
12
-
1
2
.
A
beginner
's
shotgun
has
also
been
introduced
this
year
.
The
single-barrel
Stevens
940
Y
(
under
$
35
)
is
made
with
a
side
lever
rather_than
a
top-tang
lever
because
many
youngsters
are
n't
strong
enough
to
operate
a
top
tang
to
open
a
gun
-
and
the
side
lever
does
indeed
open
very
easily
.
This
gun
has
a
12
-
1
2
-
inch
stock
and
is
available
in
either
20
or
.410
gauge
.
There
's
another
addition
to
the
Stevens
line
,
the
pump-action
Model
77
in
.410
(
under
$
75
)
,
which
you
may
or
may_not
consider
a
kid
's
gun
;
many
experienced
hunters
like
this
gauge
and
type
of
scattergun
too
.
Although
there
were
no
startling
developments
in
shotgun
design
this
year
,
a_number_of
new
models
and
variations
of
existing
models
did
hit
the
market
.
For_example
,
a
Browning
trap
version
of
the
Superposed
over
/
under
,
the
Broadway
(
from
$
350
up
,
depending_on
grade
)
,
differs
from
standard
models
in_that
it
is
equipped
with
a
full
beavertail
fore
end
,
a
cushion
recoil
pad
and
a
barrel-wide
ventilated
rib
for
fast
sighting
.
The
Colt
line
now
includes
a
new
scattergun
,
the
Standard
or
Custom_Pump
Model
(
about
$
90
and
$
150
,
respectively
)
in
12
,
16
and
20
.
Firearms_International
has
introduced
another
import
,
this
one
from
Finland
.
It
's
the
Valmet
(
about
$
170
)
,
a
12
-
gauge
over
/
under
very_much_like
the
old
Remington
32
-
which
was
so
fine
a
gun
that
today
a
used
one
still
brings
high
prices
.
High_Standard
has
also
added
two
models
to
its
line
.
The
Supermatic
Trophy
(
prices
begin
at
less_than
$
135
and
depend_on
grade
and
optional
features
)
is
a
12
-
gauge
auto
.
The
Flite-King
Trophy
(
beginning
at
just
over
$
85
)
is
a
pump
gun
in
12
or
16
.
Either
model
is
a
very
good
dollar
value
.
Mossberg
's
latest
contribution
to
the
field
is
the
Model
500
(
from
$
73.50
)
;
this
is
an
improved
version
of
the
old
Model
200
,
a
pump-action
12
-
gauge
shotgun
.
See
page
24
for
a
complete
report
on
it
.
Aside
from
the
.22
Jet
-
which
I
coupled
with
the
Deerstalker
carbine
as
one
of
the
year
's
two
biggest
developments
-
few
significant
innovations
appeared
among
1961
's
handguns
.
