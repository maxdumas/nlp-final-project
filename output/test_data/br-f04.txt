``
The
food
is
wonderful
and
it
is
a_lot_of
fun
to
be
here
''
!
So
wrote
a
ten
year
old
student
in
a
letter
to
his
parents
from
North_Country_School
,
Lake_Placid
,
New_York
.
In_this
one
sentence
,
he
unwittingly
revealed
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
nutrition
and
psychological
programs
in_operation
at
the
school
.
Because
the
food
is
selected
with
thought
for
its
nutritional
value
,
care
for
its
origin
,
and
prepared
in
a
manner
that
retains
the_most
nutrients
,
the
food
does
taste
good
.
When
served
in
a
psychological
atmosphere
that
allows
young
bodies
to
assimilate
the
greatest
good
from
what
they
eat
because
they
are
free
from
tension
,
a
foundation
is
laid
for
a
high
level
of
health
that
releases
the
children
from
physical
handicaps
to
participate
with
enjoyment
in
the
work
assignments
,
the
athletic
programs
and
the_most
important
phase
,
the
educational
opportunities
.
Situated
in
a
region
of
some
of
the
loveliest
mountain
scenery
in
the
country
,
the
school
buildings
are
located
amid
open
fields
and
farm
lands
.
These
contemporary
structures
,
beautifully
adapted
to
a
school
in
the
country
,
are
home
to
60
children
,
ages
eight
to
fourteen
,
grades
four
through
eight
.
From
fourteen
states
and
three
foreign
countries
they
come
to
spend
the
months
from
mid-September
to
June
.
The
Director
,
Walter_E._Clark
,
believes
that
a
school
with
children
living
full_time
in
its
care
must
take
full
responsibility
for
their
welfare
.
To
him
this
means
caring
for
the
whole
child
,
providing
basic
nutrition
,
and
a
spiritual
attitude
that
lends
freedom
for
the
development
of
the
mind
.
The
concept
of
good
nutrition
really
began
with
the
garden
.
The
school
has
always
maintained
a
farm
to
supply
the
needs
of
the
school
.
In
a
climate
hostile
to
agriculture
,
Mr._Clark
has
had
to
keep
alert
to
the_most
productive
farm
techniques
.
Where
a
growing_season
may
,
with
luck
,
allow
60
days
without
frost
,
and
where
the
soil
is
poor
,
sandy
,
quick-drying
and
subject_to
erosion
,
many
farmers
fail
.
Throughout
the
Adirondack
region
abandoned
farm
homes
and
wild
orchards
bear
ghostly
testimony
that
their
owners
met
defeat
.
Mr._Clark
found
that
orthodox
procedures
of
deep
plowing
,
use
of
chemical
fertilizers
and
insecticides
,
plus
the
application
of
conservation
principles
of
rotation
and
contouring
,
did
not
prevent
sheet
erosion
in
the
potato
fields
and
depreciation
of
the
soil
.
``
To
give_up
these
notions
required
a
revolution
in
thought
''
,
Mr._Clark
said
in
reminiscing
about
the
abrupt_changes
in
ideas
he
experienced
when
he
began
reading
``
Organic_Gardening
''
and
``
Modern_Nutrition
''
in
a
search
for
help
with
his
problems
.
``
Louis_Bromfield
's
writings
excited
me
as
a
conservationist
''
.
By
1952
he
was
convinced
he
would
no_longer
spray
.
He
locked
his
equipment
in
a
cabinet
where
it
still
remains
.
After
reading
``
Plowman
's
Folly
''
by
Edward_H._Faulkner
,
he
stopped
plowing
.
The
basis
for
compost
materials
already
existed
on
the
school
farm
with
a
stable
of
animals
for
the
riding
program
,
poultry
for
eggs
,
pigs
to
eat
garbage
,
a
beef
herd
and
wastes
of
all
kinds
.
Separate
pails
were
kept
in
the
kitchen
for
coffee_grounds
and
egg
shells
.
All
these
materials
and
supplementary
manure
and
other
fertilizers
from
neighboring
dairy
and
poultry
farms
made
over
40
tons
of
finished
compost
a
year
.
It
was
applied
with
a
compost
shredder
made
from
a
converted
manure
spreader
.
Years
of
patient
application
of
compost
and
leaf
mulching
has
changed
the
structure
of
the
soil
and
its
water-holding
capacity
.
Soon
after
the
method
changed
,
visitors
began
asking
how
he
managed
to
irrigate
his
soil
to
keep
it
looking
moist
,
when
in_reality
,
it
was
the
soil
treatment
alone
that
accomplished
this
.
To
demonstrate
the
soil
of
his
vegetable_gardens
as_it
is
today
,
Mr._Clark
stooped
to
scoop_up
a
handful
of
rich
dark
earth
.
Sniffing
its
sweet
smell
and
letting
it
fall
to
show
its
good
crumbly
consistency
,
he
pointed
to
the
nearby
driveway
and
said
,
``
This
soil
used_to
be
like
that
hard
packed
road
over
there
''
.
``
People
and
soils
respond
slowly
''
,
says
Walter_Clark
,
``
but
the
time
has
now
come
when
the
gardens
produce
delicious
long-keeping
vegetables
due_to
this
enrichment
program
.
No
chemical
fertilizers
and
poisonous
insecticides
and
fungicides
are
used
''
.
The
garden
supplies
enough
carrots
,
turnips
,
rutabagas
,
potatoes
,
beets
,
cabbage
and
squash
to
store
for
winter
meals
in
the
root_cellar
.
The
carrots
sometimes
do
n't
make_it
through
the
winter
;
the
cabbage
and
squash
keep
until
March
or
April
.
There
is
never
enough
corn
,
peas
or
strawberries
.
Mr._Clark
still
has
to
use
rotenone
with
potatoes
grown
on
the_least
fertile
fields
,
but
he
has
watched
the
insect
damage
decrease
steadily
and
hopes
that
continued
use
of
compost
and
leaf
mulch
will
allow
him
to
do
without
it
in_the_future
.
A
new
project
planned
is
the
use
of
Bio-Dynamic_Starter
.
New
ideas
for
improving
nutrition
came_with
the
study
of
soil
treatment
.
``
After
the
soil
,
the
kitchen
''
,
says
Mr._Clark
.
The
first
major
change
was
that
of
providing
wholewheat
bread
instead
of
white_bread
.
``
Adults
take
a
long_time
to
convince
and
you
are
thwarted
if
you
try
to
push
''
.
At_first
the
kitchen
help
was
tolerant
,
but
ordered
their
own
supply
of
white_bread
for
themselves
.
``
You
can
n't
make
French_toast
with
whole-wheat
bread
''
,
was
an
early
complaint
.
Of_course
they
learned
in_time
that
they
not_only
could
use
whole-wheat
bread
,
but
the
children
liked
it
better
.
Mrs._Clark
,
as
house
manager
,
planned
the
menus
and
cared
for
the
ordering
.
Then
Miss_Lillian_Colman
came
from
Vermont
to
be
kitchen
manager
.
Today
whole
grains
are
freshly
ground
every_day
and
baked
into
bread
.
Mr._Clark
's
studies
taught
him
that
the
only
way
to
conserve
the
vitamins
in
the
whole
grain
was
prompt
use
of
the
flour
.
Once
the
grains
are
ground
,
vitamin_E
begins
to
deteriorate
immediately
and
half
of_it
is
lost
by
oxidation
and
exposure
to
the
air
within
one
week
.
A
mill
stands
in
a
room
off
the
kitchen
.
Surrounding
it
are
metal
cans
of
grains
ordered
from
organic
farms
in
the
state
.
Miss_Colman
pours
measures
of
whole
wheat
,
oats
,
and
soy_beans
and
turns_on
the
motor
.
She
goes_on
about
her
work
and
listens
for
the
completion
of
the
grinding
.
The
bread
baked
from
this
mixture
is
light
in
color
and
fragrant
in
aroma
.
It
is
well
liked
by
the
children
and
faculty
.
There
is
one
problem
with
the
bread
.
``
Lillian
's
bread
is
so
good
and
everything
tastes
so_much
better
here
that
it
is
hard
not
to
eat
too_much
''
,
said
the
secretary
ruefully
eyeing
her
extra
pounds
.
The
school
has
not
used
cold
prepared
cereals
for
years
,
though
at_one_time
that
was
all
they
ever
served
.
When
the
chance
came
,
they
first
eliminated
cold_cereal
once
a
week
,
then
gradually
converted
to
hot
fresh-ground
cereal
every_day
.
They
serve
cracked
wheat
,
oats
or
cornmeal
.
Occasionally
,
the
children
find
steamed
,
whole-wheat
grains
for
cereal
which
they
call
``
buckshot
''
.
At
the
beginning
of
the
school_year
,
the
new
students
do
n't
eat
the
cereal
right_away
,
but
within
a
short_time
they
are
eating
it
voraciously
.
When
they
leave
for
vacations
they
miss
the
hot_cereal
.
The
school
has
received
letters
from
parents
asking
,
``
What
happened
to
Johnny
?
He
never
used_to
like
any
hot_cereal
,
now
that
's
the
only
kind
he
wants
.
Where
can
we
get
this
cereal
he
likes
so_much
''
?
Salads
are
served
at_least
once
a
day
.
Vegetables
are
served
liberally
.
Most
come
from
the
root_cellar
or
from
the
freezer
.
Home-made
sauerkraut
is
served
once
a
week
.
Sprouted
grains
and
seeds
are
used
in
salads
and
dishes
such_as
chop_suey
.
Sometimes
sprouted
wheat
is_added
to
bread
and
causes
the
children
to
remark
,
``
Lillian
,
did
you
put
nuts
in
the
bread
today
''
?
Milk
appears
twice
a
day
.
The
school
raises
enough
poultry
,
pigs
,
and
beef_cattle
for
most_of
their
needs
.
Lots_of
cheese
made
from
June_grass
milk
is
served
.
Hens
are
kept
on
the
range
and
roosters
are
kept
with
them
for
their
fertility
.
Organ
meats
such_as
beef
and
chicken_liver
,
tongue
and
heart
are
planned
once
a
week
.
Also
,
salt
water
fish
is
on
the
table
once
a
week
.
For
deserts
,
puddings
and
pies
are
each
served
once
a
week
.
Most
other
desserts
are
fruit
in
some
form
,
fresh
fruits
once
daily
at_least
,
sometimes
at
snack
time
.
Dried_fruits
are
purchased
from
sources
where
they
are
neither
sulphured
nor
sprayed
.
Apples
come
from
a
farm
in
Vermont
where
they
are
not
sprayed
.
Oranges
and
grapefruit
are
shipped
from
Florida
weekly
from
an
organic
farm
.
Finding
sources
for
these
high_quality
foods
is
a
problem
.
Sometimes
the
solution
comes
in
unexpected
ways
.
Following
a
talk
by
Mr._Clark
at
the
New_York
State_Natural_Food
Associates
Convention
,
a
man
from
the
audience
offered
to
ship
his
unsprayed
apples
to
the
school
from
Vermont
.
Wheat-germ
,
brewer
's
yeast
and
ground
kelp
are
used
in
bread
and
in
dishes
such_as
spaghetti_sauce
,
meat_loaves
.
Miss_Colman
hopes
to
find
suitable
shakers
so_that
kelp
can
be
available
at
the
tables
.
Raw
wheat-germ
is
available
on
the
breakfast_table
for
the
children
to
help
themselves
.
Very_few
fried
foods
are
used
and
the
use
of
salt
and
pepper
is
discouraged
.
Drinking
with
meals
is
also
discouraged
;
pitchers
of
water
merely
appear
on
the
tables
.
Nothing
is
peeled
.
The
source
is
known
so
there
is
no
necessity
to
remove
insecticide
residues
.
The
cooking
conserves
a
maximum
of
the
vitamin_C
content
of
vegetables
by
methods
which
use
very
little
water
and
cook
in
the
shortest
time
possible
.
Since
Mr._Clark
believes
firmly
that
the
chewing
of
hard
foods
helps
develop
healthy
gums
and
teeth
,
raw_vegetables
and
raw
whole-wheat
grains
are
handed_out
with
fresh
fruit
and
whole-wheat
cookies
at
snack
time
in
the
afternoons
.
To
solve
the
problem
of
the
wheat
grains
spilling
on
the
floor
and
getting
underfoot
,
a
ball
of
maple_syrup
boiled
to
candy
consistency
was
invented
to
hold
the
grains
.
On
their
frequent
hikes
into
the
nearby
mountains
,
the
children
carry
whole
grains
to
munch
along
the
trail
.
They
learn
to
like
these
so
well
that
it
is
n't
surprising
to
hear
that
one
boy
tried
the
oats
he
was
feeding
his
horse
at
chore
time
.
They
tasted
good
to
him
,
so
he
brought
some
to
breakfast
to
eat
in
his
cereal_bowl
with
milk
and
honey
.
Maple_syrup
is
made
by
the
children
in
the
woods
on
the
school
grounds
.
This
and
raw
sugar
replace
ordinary
refined_sugar
on
the
tables
and
very
little
sugar
is
used
in
cooking
.
Candy
is
not
allowed
.
Parents
are
asked
in
the
bulletin
to
send
packages
of
treats
consisting_of
fruit
and
nuts
,
but
no
candy
.
Mr._Clark
believes_in
a
good
full
breakfast
of
fruit
,
hot_cereal
,
milk
,
honey
,
whole-wheat
toast
with
real
butter
and
eggs
.
The
heavy
meal
comes
in
the
middle
of
the
day
.
Soup
is
often
the
important
dish
at
supper
.
Homemade
of
meat
,
bones
and
vegetables
,
it
is
rich_in
dissolved
minerals
and
vitamins
.
The
school
finds
that
the
children
are
satisfied
with
smaller
amounts
of
food
since
all_of
it
is
high
in
quality
.
The
cost
to
feed
one
person
is
just
under
one
dollar
a
day
.
Even
before
he
saw
the
necessity
of
growing
better
food
and
planning
good
nutrition
,
Mr._Clark
felt
the
school
had
a
good_health
program
.
Rugged
outdoor
exercise
for
an
hour
and
a
half
every_day
in_all
kinds
of
weather
was
the
rule
.
A
vigorous
program
existed
in
skiing
,
skating
sports
and
overnight
hiking
.
Since
the
change
to
better
nutrition
,
he
feels
he
can
report
on
improvements
in
health
,
though
he
considers
the
following
statements
observations
and
not
scientific
proof
.
Visitors
to
the
school
ask
what
shampoo
they
use
on
the
children
's
hair
to
bring_out
the
sheen
.
The
ruddy
complexion
of
the
faces
also
brings
comment
.
