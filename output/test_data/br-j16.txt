In
attempting
to
improve
specificity
of
staining
,
the
fluorescein
labeled
antisera
used
in
both
direct
and
indirect
methods
were
treated
in
one
of
several
ways
:
(
1
)
They
were
passed_through
Dowex-2-chloride
twice
and
treated
with
acetone
insoluble
powders
(
Coons
,
1958
)
prepared
from
mouse
liver
or
from
healthy
sweet_clover
stems
or
crown_gall
tissue
produced
by
Agrobacterium_tumefaciens
(
E._F._Smith
+
Townsend
)
Conn
,
on
sweet_clover
stems
.
(

)
The
conjugates
as_well_as
the
intermediate
sera
were
absorbed
for
30_minutes
with
20
-
50
mg
of
proteins
extracted
from
healthy
sweet_clover
stems
.
The
proteins
were
extracted
with
3
volumes
of
*
*
f
in
*
*
f
to
give
a
nearly
neutral
extract
and
precipitated
by
80
%
saturation
with
*
*
f
.
The
precipitate
was
washed
twice
with
an
80
%
saturated
solution
of
*
*
f
,
dissolved
in
a
small
quantity
of
0.1
M
neutral
phosphate
buffer
,
dialyzed
against
cold
distilled_water
till
free
from
ammonium_ions
,
and
lyophilized
using
liquid_nitrogen
.
(

)
In
other
experiments
the
indirect
conjugate
was
treated
with
3
volumes
of
ethyl_acetate
as
recommended
by
Dineen
and
Ade
(
1957
)
.
(

)
The
conjugates
were
passed_through
a
diethylaminoethyl
(
DEAE
-
)
cellulose
column
equilibrated
with
neutral
phosphate
buffer
(
PBS
)
containing
*
*
f
potassium
phosphate
and
*
*
f
.
The
technique
of
cutting
sections
was
essentially
the
same
as
that
described
by
Coons
et_al.
(
1951
)
.
Root
and
stem
tumors
from
sweet_clover
plants
infected
with
WTV
were
quick-frozen
in
liquid_nitrogen
,
embedded
in
ice
,
and
cut
at
3
-
6
|
m
in
a
cryostat
maintained
at
-
16
`
to
-
20
`
.
The
sections
were
mounted
on
cold
slides
smeared
with
Haupts
'
adhesive
(
Johansen
,
1940
)
in
earlier
experiments
,
and
in
later
experiments
with
a
different
mixture
of
the
same
components
reported
by
Schramm
and
Rottger
(
1959
)
.
The
latter
adhesive
was
found
to
be
much
more
satisfactory
.
The
sections
were
then
thawed
by
placing
a
finger
under
the
slide
and
dried
under
a
fan
for
30_minutes
;
until
used
they
were
stored
for
as_long_as
2
weeks
.
The
sections
were
fixed
in
acetone
for
15_minutes
and
dried
at
37
`
for
30_minutes
.
Some
of
them
were
then
covered
with
a
drop
of
*
*
f
in
a
moist
chamber
at
24
`
for
30
-
40
minutes
.
As
controls
other
sections
were
similarly
covered
with
NS
.
Sections
were
then
washed
with
PBS
for
15
-
30_minutes
.
After
blotting_out
most
of
the
saline
around
the
sections
,
a
drop
of
*
*
f
was
layered
over
each
of
the
sections
,
allowed
to
react
for
30_minutes
,
and
then
washed
with
PBS
for
15
-
30_minutes
.
After
blotting_out
most
of
the
liquid
around
the
sections
,
the
latter
were
mounted
in
buffered
glycerine
(
7
parts
glycerine
to
3
parts
of
PBS
)
.
After
drying
the
sections
under
the
fan
,
fixing
in
acetone
,
and
drying
at
37
`
as
in
the
indirect
method
,
the
sections
were
treated
with
conjugated
*
*
f
or
*
*
f
(
undiluted
unless
mentioned
otherwise
)
for
5
-
30_minutes
.
As
controls
,
other
sections
were
similarly
treated
with
*
*
f
or
conjugated
antiserum
to
the
New_York
strain
of
potato_yellow-dwarf_virus
(
Wolcyrz
and
Black
,
1956
)
.
The
sections
were
then
washed
with
PBS
for
15
-
30_minutes
and
mounted
in
buffered
glycerine
.
Stained
or
unstained
sections
were
examined
under
dark_field_illumination
in
a
Zeiss
fluorescence
microscope
equipped
with
a
mercury
vapor
lamp
(
Osram_HBO
200
)
.
The
light_beam
from
the
lamp
was
filtered
through
a
half
standard
thickness
Corning
1840
filter
.
In
the
eyepiece
a
Wratten
2
B
filter
was
used
to
filter
off
residual
ultra-violet_light
.
A
red
filter
,
Zeiss
barrier
filter
with
the
code
(
Schott
)
designation
BG
23
,
was
also
used
in
the
ocular
lens
assembly
as
it
improved
the
contrast
between
specific
and
nonspecific
fluorescence
.
In
the
first
few
experiments
*
*
f
was
passed_through
Dowex-2-chloride
twice
and
absorbed
twice
with
50
-
100
mg
sweet_clover
tissue
powder
.
The
intermediate
sera
were
also
similarly
absorbed
with
tissue
powder
.
Sections
of
sweet_clover
stem
and
root
tumors
were
treated
with
1
:
10
solution
of
*
*
f
for
30_minutes
,
washed
in
buffered
saline
for
15_minutes
,
stained
with
*
*
f
for
30_minutes
,
and
washed
for
15_minutes
in
PBS
.
Such
sections
showed
bright
yellow-green
specific
fluorescence
in
the
cells
of
the
pseudophloem
tissue
(
Lee
and
Black
,
1955
)
.
This
specific
fluorescence
was
readily
distinguished
from
the
light_green
nonspecific
fluorescence
in
consecutive
sections
stained
with
1
:
10
dilution
of
NS
and
*
*
f
or
with
*
*
f
alone
.
Unstained
sections
mounted
in
buffered
glycerine
or
sections
treated
only
with
NS
or
*
*
f
did
not
show
such
green
fluorescence
.
Sections
of
crown_gall
tissue
similarly
stained
with
either
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
or
NS
and
*
*
f
also
showed
only
the
light_green
nonspecific
fluorescence
.
However
,
the
nonspecific
staining
by
the
*
*
f
in
tumor
sections
was
considered
bright
enough
to
be
confused
with
the
staining
of
small
amounts
of
WTV
antigen
.
Two
absorptions
of
*
*
f
with
ethyl_acetate
or
two
absorptions
of
*
*
f
(
which
had
been
passed_through
Dowex-2-chloride
)
,
NS
and
*
*
f
with
crown_gall
tissue
powder
,
or
mouse
liver
powder
did
not
further
improve
the
specificity
of
staining
.
Treatment
of
all
the
sera
with
sweet_clover
proteins
greatly
reduced
nonspecific
fluorescence
,
especially
when
the
treated
conjugate
was
diluted
to
1
:
2
with
0.85
%
saline
.
In
all
the
above
procedures
,
when
the
intermediate
sera
were
diluted
to
1
:
10
or
1
:
100
with
0.85
%
saline
,
the
specific
and
nonspecific
fluorescence
were
not
appreciably
reduced
,
whereas
,
a
dilution
of
the
intermediate
sera
to
1
:
500
or
diluting
the
*
*
f
to
1
:
5
greatly
reduced
specific
fluorescence
.
Rinsing
the
sections
with
PBS
before
layering
the
intermediate
sera
did
not
improve
the
staining
reaction
.
In_addition
to
other
treatments
,
treating
the
sections
with
normal
sheep
serum
for
half
an
hour
before
layering
*
*
f
did
not
reduce
nonspecific
staining
.
The
only
treatment
by
which
nonspecific
staining
could
be
satisfactorily
removed
was
by
passing
the
conjugate
through
a
DEAE-cellulose
column
.
When
1
ml
of
conjugate
was
passed_through
a
column
(
*
*
f
)
,
the
first
and
second
milliliter
fractions
collected
were
the
most
specific
and
gave
no
nonspecific
staining
in
some
experiments
,
and
very
little
in
others
.
In
the
latter
cases
an
additional
treatment
of
the
DEAE
cellulose
treated
*
*
f
with
50
mg
of
sweet_clover
stem
tissue
powder
further
improved
the
specificity
.
After
these
treatments
the
conjugate
did
not
stain
healthy
or
crown_gall
sweet_clover
tissues
or
stained
them
a
very
faint
green
which
was
easily
distinguishable
from
the
bright
yellow-green
specific
staining
.
With
this
purified
conjugate
the
best
staining
procedure
consisted_of
treating
the
sections
with
1
:
10
dilution
of
*
*
f
for
30_minutes
,
washing
with
PBS
for
15_minutes
,
staining
with
*
*
f
for
30_minutes
,
and
washing
with
PBS
for
15_minutes
.
The
specificity
of
staining
in
WTV
tumors
with
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
but
not
with
NS
and
*
*
f
or
with
antiserum
to
potato_yellow-dwarf_virus
and
*
*
f
,
and
the
absence
of
such
staining
in
crown_gall
tumor
tissue
from
sweet-clover
,
indicate
that
an
antigen
of
WTV
was
being
stained
.
*
*
f
was
first
conjugated
with
50
mg
of
FITC
per
gram
of
globulin
.
This
conjugate
was
passed
twice
through
Dowex-2-chloride
and
treated
with
various
tissue
powders
in
the
same
manner
as
described
for
the
indirect
method
.
In
all
cases
a
disturbing
amount
of
nonspecific
staining
was
still
present
although
it
was
still
distinguishable
from
specific
fluorescence
.
In
later
experiments
,
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
were
prepared
by
conjugating
8
mg
of
FITC
per
gram
of
globulin
.
These
conjugates
*
*
f
had
much
less
nonspecific
staining
than
the
previous
conjugate
(
with
50
mg
FITC
per
gram
of
globulin
)
while
the
specific
staining
was
similar
in
both
cases
.
Nonspecific
staining
could
be
satisfactorily
eliminated
by
passing
these
conjugates
through
a
DEAE-cellulose
column
as
described
for
*
*
f
.
The
best
staining
procedure
with
this
purified
*
*
f
consisted_of
staining
with
the
conjugate
for
30_minutes
and
washing
in
PBS
for
15_minutes
.
The
specificity
of
staining
with
*
*
f
was
established
as_follows
:
*
*
f
specifically
stained
tumor
sections
but
not
sections
of
healthy
sweet_clover
stems
or
of
crown_gall
tumor
tissue
from
sweet_clover
.
Sections
of
tumors
incited
by
WTV
were
not
similarly
stained
with
conjugated
normal
serum
or
conjugated
antiserum
to
potato_yellow-dwarf_virus
.
After
passing
*
*
f
through
DEAE-cellulose
,
the
titer
of
antibodies
to
WTV
in
the
specific
fraction
was
1
:
4
of
the
titer
before
such
passage
(
precipitin
ring
tests
by
R._F._Whitcomb
)
;
but
mere
dilution
of
the
conjugate
to
1
:
4
did
not
satisfactorily
remove
nonspecific
staining
.
This
indicates
that
increase
in
specificity
of
*
*
f
after
passing
it
through
DEAE-cellulose
was
not
merely
due_to
dilution
.
Specific
staining
by
DEAE-cellulose
treated
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
,
although
clearly
distinguishable
under
the
microscope
from
either
nonspecific
staining
or
autofluorescence
of
cells
,
was
not
satisfactorily
photographed
to
show
such
differences
in_spite_of
many
attempts
with
black_and_white
and
color
photography
.
This
was
chiefly
because
of
the
bluish
white
autofluorescence
from
the
cells
.
The
autofluorescence
from
the
walls
of
the
xylem
cells
was
particularly
brilliant
.
Results
of
specific
staining
by
the
direct
and
the
indirect
methods
were
similar
and
showed
the
localization
of
WTV
antigen
in
certain
tissues
of
tumors
.
The
virus
antigen
was
concentrated
in
the
pseudophloem
tissue
.
Frequently
a_few
isolated
thick
walled
cells
or
,
rarely
,
groups
of
such
cells
in
the
xylem
region
,
were
also
specifically
stained
,
but
there
was
no
such
staining
in
epidermis
,
cortex
,
most
xylem
cells
,
ray
cells
,
or
pith
.
Within
the
pseudophloem
cells
the
distribution
of
WTV
antigen
was
irregular
in
the
cytoplasm
.
No
antigen
was
detectable
in
certain
dark
spherical
areas
in
most
cells
.
These
areas
are
thought
to
represent
the
nuclei
.
In
some
tumor
sections
small
spherical
bodies
,
possibly
inclusion_bodies
(
Littau
and
Black
,
1952
)
stained
more
intensely
than
the
rest
of
cytoplasm
and
probably
contained
more
antigen
.
In
all
cases
studied
tissues
of
the
stem
on
which
the
tumor
had
developed
did
not
contain
detectable
amounts
of
WTV
antigen
.
In
both
the
direct
and
indirect
methods
of
staining
,
the
conjugates
had
nonspecifically
staining
fractions
.
In
the
indirect
method
,
this
was
evident
from
the
fact
that
tumor
sections
were
stained
light_green
even
when
stained
with
NS
and
*
*
f
or
with
*
*
f
only
.
In
the
direct
method
,
*
*
f
,
not
further
treated
,
stained
certain
tissues
of
healthy
sweet_clover
stems
nonspecifically
and
WTV
tumor
sections
were
similarly
stained
by
comparable
*
*
f
.
After
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
were
passed_through
Dowex-2-chloride
twice
and
treated
twice
with
healthy
sweet_clover
tissue
powder
,
nonspecific
staining
was
greatly
reduced
but
a
disturbing
amount
of
such
staining
was
still
present
.
Treatment
of
the
conjugates
with
ethyl_acetate
,
and
the
conjugates
(
which
had
been
passed_through
Dowex-2-chloride
)
with
mouse
liver
powder
,
sweet_clover
crown_gall
tissue
powder
,
or
healthy
sweet_clover
proteins
did
not
satisfactorily
remove
nonspecifically
staining
substances
in
the
conjugates
.
Such
treatments
of
the
conjugates
have
usually
been
successful
in
eliminating
nonspecific
staining
in
several
other
systems
(
Coons
,
1958
)
.
Schramm
and
Rottger
(
1959
)
did
not
report
any
such
nonspecific
staining
of
plant_tissues
with
fluorescein
isocyanate
labeled
antiserum
to
tobacco_mosaic_virus
.
The
reason
for
the
failure
of
these
treatments
to
eliminate
nonspecific
staining
in
the
conjugates
in
our
system
is
not
known
.
In
our
work
the
best
procedure
for
removing
substances
causing
nonspecific
staining
in_order
to
obtain
specific
conjugates
was
to
pass
the
conjugates
through
a
DEAE-cellulose
column
and
in
some
cases
to
absorb
the
first
and
second
milliliter
fractions
with
sweet_clover
tissue
powder
.
The
specific
staining
by
both
direct
and
indirect
methods
showed
that
WTV
antigen
was
concentrated
in
the
pseudophloem
tissue
and
in
a_few
thick
walled
cells
in
the
xylem
region
,
but
was
not
detectable
in
any
other
tissues
of
the
root
and
stem
tumors
.
A
study
of
the
distribution
of
WTV
antigen
within
the
pseudophloem
cells
indicates
that
it
is
irregularly
distributed
in
the
cytoplasm
.
Wound_tumor_virus
is
a
leafhopper
transmitted
virus
not
easily
transmissible
by
mechanical
inoculation
(
Black
,
1944
;
Brakke
et_al.
,
1954
)
.
The
concentration
and
apparent
localization
of
the
WTV
antigen
in
pseudophloem
tissue
of
the
tumor
may
indicate
that
the
virus
preferentially
multiplies
in
the
phloem
and
may
need
to
be
directly
placed
in
this
tissue
in_order_to
infect
plants
.
