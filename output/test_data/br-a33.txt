At_last
the
White_House
is
going
to
get
some
much-copied
furniture
by
that
master
American
craftsman
,
Duncan_Phyfe
,
whose
designs
were
snubbed
in
his
lifetime
when
the
U._S.
Presidents
of
the
19
th
Century
sent
abroad
for
their
furnishings
.
The
American_Institute
of
Decorators
has
acquired
a
rare
complete
set
of
sofas
and
chairs
which
are
to
be
placed
in
the
Executive_Mansion
's
library
.
The
suite
has
been
in
the
same
family
since
the
early
1800
's
.
The
gift
is
being
presented
by
``
heirs
and
descendants
of
the
Rutherford
family
of
New_Jersey
,
whose
famous
estate
,
''
Tranquility
``
,
was
located
near
the
Duncan_Phyfe
workshop
at
Andover
,
N._J.
.
Authenticated
pieces
of
Duncan_Phyfe
furniture
are
uncommon
,
although
millions
of
American
homes
today
display
pieces
patterned
after
the
style
trends
he
set
150
years
ago
.
This
acquisition
is
a
matched
,
perfect
set
-
consisting_of
two
sofas
six
feet
long
,
plus
six
sidechairs
and
two
armchairs
.
The
AID
has
undertaken
the
redecoration
of
the
*
White_House
library
as
a
project
in
connection
with
the
work
being
done
by
First_Lady
Jacqueline_Kennedy
's
Fine_Arts
Advisory_Committee
to
secure
antiques
for
the
presidential
home
.
It
is
the
AID
's
intention
to
create
in
the
library
``
a
miniature
museum
of
Americana
''
before
completed
refurbishing
is
unveiled
early
this
fall
.
The
room
will
also
feature
another
rarity
many
antiquarians
would
consider
more
important
than
the
Duncan_Phyfe
furniture
.
The
AID
has
found
a
mantlepiece
attributed
to
Samuel_McIntyre
of
Salem
,
Mass.
,
an
architect
and
woodcarver
who
competed
for
the
designing
of
the
Capitol
here
in
1792
.
The
mantel
was
found
in
a
recently
demolished
Salem
house
and
is
being
fitted
over
the
White_House
library
fireplace
.
It
will
be
painted
to
match
the
paneling
in
the
room
.
The
AID
committee
's
chairman
in
charge
of
the
redecoration
,
Mrs._Henry_Francis_Lenygon
,
was
in
town
yesterday
to
consult
with
White_House
staff_members
on
the
project
.
Mrs._Lenygon
's
committee
associates
,
announced
formally
yesterday
by
the
AID
in
New_York
,
include
Mrs._Allen_Lehman_McCluskey
and
Stephen_J._Jussel
,
both
wellknown
Manhattan
decorators
.
Regional
representatives
appointed
to
serve
from
each
section
of
the
country
include
Frank_E._Barnes
of
Boston
.
President_Kennedy
could
n't
stay_away_from
his
desk
for
the
75
-
minute
young
people
's
concert
played
on
the
White_House
lawn
yesterday
by
the
85
-
piece
Transylvania
Symphony_Orchestra
from
Brevard
,
N._C.
.
But
he
left
the
doors
to
his
office
open
so
he
could
hear
the
music
.
At
4
p.
m.
the
President
left
the
White_House
to
welcome
the
young
musicians
,
students
from
the
ages
of
12
to
18
who
spend
six
weeks
at
the
Brevard_Music_Center
summer_camp
,
and
to
greet
the
325
crippled
,
cardiac
and
blind
children
from
the
District
area
who
were
special
guests
at
the
concert
.
It
was
the
first
in
the
series
of
``
Concerts
for
Young
People
by
Young
People
''
to
be
sponsored
by
First_Lady
Jacqueline_Kennedy
at
the
White_House
.
She
was
not
present
yesterday
,
however
,
to
enjoy
the
music
or
watch
the
faces
of
the
delighted
audience
.
She
is
vacationing
at
the
Kennedy
summer
home
in
Hyannis_Port
,
Mass.
,
and
in
his
welcoming
remarks
,
the
President
said
he
was
representing
her
.
As
he
approached
the
open
bandstand
,
erected
facing
the
South
entrance
to
the
Executive_Mansion
,
the
band
struck_up
the
``
Star_Spangled_Banner
''
and
followed
it
with
``
Hail
to
the
Chief
''
.
``
I
think
they
played
Hail
to
the
Chief
better
than
the
Marine_Corps
Band
,
and
we
are
grateful
to
them
''
,
President_Kennedy
remarked
after
mounting
the
bandstand
and
shaking_hands
with
conductor
James_Christian_Pfohl
.
After
paying
tribute
to
the
conductor
and
his
white-clad
youthful
students
,
President_Kennedy
said
,
``
As
an
American
I
have
the
greatest
possible
pride
in
the
work
that_is
being
done
in
dozens
of
schools
stretching
across
the
United_States
-
schools
where
devoted
teachers
are
studying
with
interested
young_men
and
women
and
opening_up
the
whole
wide
horizon
of
serious_music
''
.
He
added
``
I
think
that
sometimes
in_this
country
we
are
not
aware
as
we
should
be
of
the
extraordinary
work
that_is
being
done
in
this
field
''
.
Displaying
his
knowledge
of
music
,
the
New
England-born
President
remarked
that
``
probably
the
best
chamber_music
in
the
world
is
played
in
Vermont
,
by
young
Americans
-
and
here
in_this
school
where
they
have
produced
extraordinary
musicians
and
teachers
,
and
their
work
is
being
duplicated
all
across
the
United_States
.
``
This
is
a
great
national
cultural
asset
,
and
therefore
it
is
a
great
source
of
satisfaction
to
me
,
representing
as
I
do
today
my
wife
,
to
welcome
all_of
you
here
today
at
the
White_House
''
.
As
he
left
the
bandstand
to
return
to
his
office
,
the
slender
,
sun-tanned
Chief_Executive
paused
along
the
way
to
shake_hands
with
the
members
of
the
audience
in
wheel
chairs
forming
the
first
row
under
the
field_tent
set_up
for
the
guests
.
He
expressed
surprise
to
learn
that
pretty
,
blonde
Patricia_Holbrook
,
16
,
of
Mount_Rainier
,
had
attended
the
Joseph_P._Kennedy_School
for
the
Handicapped
in
Boston
.
``
The
nuns
there
do
a
wonderful
work
''
,
the
President
commented
.
Patricia
now
attends
the
C._Melvin_Sharpe_Health_School
in
the
District
.
Each
of
the
children
invited
to
the
concert
wore
a
name_tag
marked
with
a
red
,
white
and
blue_ribbon
.
They
enjoyed
lemonade
and
cookies
served
before
and
during
the
concert
by
teenage
sons
and
daughters
of
members
of
the
White_House
staff
.
Many_of
the
music-loving
members
of
the
President
's
staff
gathered
around
the
tent
listening
and
watching
the
rapt
attention
given
by
the
young
seated
audience
.
And
it
turned_out
to
be
more
of
a
family
affair
than
expected
.
Henry_Hall_Wilson
,
a
student
at
the
music
camp
25
years
ago
and
now
on
the
President
's
staff
as
liaison
representative
with
the
House_of_Representatives
,
turned
guest
conductor
for
a
Sousa
march
,
the
``
Stars_and_Stripes
Forever
''
.
Transylvania_Symphony
Conductor
Pfohl
said
yesterday
that
Mrs._Kennedy
's
Social_Secretary
,
Letitia_Baldrige
,
told
about
plans
for
White_House
youth
concerts
before
the
National
Symphony_Orchestra
League
in
Philadelphia
last
spring
.
He
said
he
contacted
a
friend
,
Henry_Hall_Wilson
,
on
the
President
's
staff
and
asked
whether
his
orchestra
could
play
,
in
the
series
.
A
flow
of
correspondence
between
Pfohl
and
Miss_Baldrige
resulted
in
an
invitation
to
the
85
-
student
North_Carolina
group
to
play
the
first
concert
.
One
of
the_most
interested
``
students
''
on
the
tour
which
the
Brevard
group
took
at
the
National_Gallery
yesterday
following
their
concert
at
the
White_House
,
was
Letitia_Baldrige
,
social_secretary
to
First_Lady
Jacqueline_Kennedy
.
``
I
was
an
art
major
in
college
''
,
Miss_Baldrige
explained
.
``
I
've
been
here
so
many_times
I
could
n't
count
them
''
.
She
turned_out
to
be
a
fan
,
too
,
of
Margaret_Bouton
,
the
Gallery
's
associate
curator
of
education
.
Miss_Bouton
headed_up
one
of
the
four
groups
that
went
on
simultaneous
tours
after
the
Gallery
had
closed
at
5
p.
m.
.
The
Brevard
group
of
85
arrived
at
the
Gallery
at
6
p.
m.
,
remaining
for
about
45
minutes
.
The
Brevard
visitors
had
very
little
to
say
at
the
beginning
of
the
tour
but
warmed_up
later
.
They
decided
that
they
thought
Rembrandt
's
self-portrait
made
him
look
``
sad
''
.
They
noticed
Roman_buildings
in
the
background
of
Raphael
's
``
Alba_Madonna
''
and
``
texture
''
in
a
Monet
painting
of
Rheims_Cathedral
.
Everybody
had
heard
of
Van_Gogh
,
the_French
impressionist
.
Gallery_Director_John_Walker
greeted
the
group
,
standing
on
one
of
the
benches
in
the
downstairs
lobby
to
speak_to
them
.
He
pointed_out
to
the
young
musicians
that
the
National_Gallery
``
is
the
only
museum
in
the
country
to
have
a
full-time
music_director
,
Richard_Bales
,
I
'm
sure
you
've
heard
af
him
and
his
record
,
'
The
Confederacy
''
'
.
Along
with
the
gallery
aide
who
explained
the
various
paintings
and
sculptures
to
each
group
,
went
one
of
the
Gallery
's
blue-uniformed
guards
.
In
45
minutes
,
the
Gallery
leaders
had
given
the
students
a
quick
rundown
on
art
from
the
Renaissance
to
the
late
19
th
Century
.
A_few
of
them
said
they
``
preferred
contemporary
art
''
.
Among
the
other
artists
,
whose
paintings
were
discussed
were
Boucher
,
Courbet
,
Fra_Angelico
.
The
thing
that
impressed
one
of
the
visitors
the_most
was
the
Gallery
's
rotunda
fountain
``
because
it
's
on
the
second
floor
''
.
That
imposing
,
somewhat
austere
,
and
seemingly
remote
collonaded
building
with
the
sphynxes
perched
on
its
threshold
at
1733
16
th
st.
nw.
took_on
bustling
life
yesterday
.
More_than
250
Scottish_Rite
Masons
and
guests
gathered
in
their
House
of
the
Temple
to
pay
tribute
to
their
most
prominent
leader
,
Albert_Pike
,
who
headed
the
Scottish_Rite
from
1859
to
1891
.
They
came
together
in
the
huge
,
high-ceilinged
Council_Chamber
to
hear
the
late
leader
eulogized
.
C._Wheeler_Barnes
of
Denver
,
head
of
the
Scottish_Rite
in
Colorado
,
praised
Pike
as
a
historian
,
author
,
poet
,
journalist
,
lawyer
,
jurist
,
soldier
and
musician
,
who
devoted
most_of
his
mature
years
to
the
strengthening
of
the
Masonic_Order
.
The
ceremony
ended
with
the
laying
of
a
wreath
at
the
crypt
of
Pike
in
the
House
of
the
Temple
.
A
reception
and
tea
followed
.
About
1500
delegates
are
expected
to
register
today
for
the
biennial
session
of
the
Ancient
and
Accepted
Scottish_Rite
for
the
Southern_Jurisdiction
of
the
United_States
.
The
opening
session
of
the
5
-
day
session
will
begin
at
10
a.
m.
today
.
There
will
be
a
pilgrimage
to
Mount_Vernon
at
2
:
30
p.
m.
.
A
wreath
will
be
placed
at
the
tomb
of
George_Washington
,
one
of_this
Nation
's
first
Masons
-
a
past_master
of
Washington-Alexandria_Lodge
22
in
Alexandria
.
The
marriage
of
John
and
Mary_Black
had
clearly
reached
the
breaking_point
after
eight
years
.
John
had
a
job
in
a
small
firm
where
the
work
was
dull
and
monotonous
.
He
would
come
home
in
the
evening
tired
and
discouraged
-
in
no
frame_of_mind
to
play
with
their
three
children
,
or
spend
much
time
chatting
with
his
wife
.
Hurt
by
his
lack
of
interest
and
attention
,
Mary
complained
often
that
he
did
n't
help
around
the
house
,
and
that
he
did
n't
really
care
about
the
family
.
She
accused
him
of
ignoring
her
.
He
in_turn
told
her
she
demanded
too_much
.
They
were
both
discouraged
,
disgusted
and
miserable
.
Mary
decided
she
had
had
enough
.
Without
any
definite
plan
in
mind
,
she
went
to
a
judge
to
see
what
could
be
done
.
The
judge
listened
quietly
as
the
young_woman
poured_out
her
frustrations
-
then
discussing
with
her
the
possibility
of
seeking
aid
from
Family_Service
before
going_to
a
lawyer
.
Family_Service
,
sharing_in
UGF
,
has
five
agencies
in
the
Washington
area
.
They
offer
to
the
people
of_this
community
case
work
service
and
counseling
on
a
wide
variety
of
family
problems
.
Because
neither
of
them
really
wanted
their
marriage
to
break_up
,
Mr.
and
Mrs._Black
agreed
to
a
series
of
interviews
at
Family_Service
of
Northern_Virginia
,
the
agency
nearest
them
.
For
nearly
a
year
,
they
have
been
receiving
counseling
,
separately
and
together
,
in
an
effort
to
understand
and
overcome
the
antagonisms
which
had
given_rise
to
the
possibility
of
divorce
.
The
interviews
have
led
each
of
them
to
a
new
appreciation
of
the
problems
confronting
the
other
.
They
are
now
working
together
toward
solving
their
difficulties
.
John
received
a
promotion
in
his
firm
.
He
gives
credit
for
the
promotion
to
his
new
outlook
on
life
.
Mary
is
cheery
and
gay
when
her
husband
comes
home
in
the
evenings
,
and
the
children
's
bed-time
is
frequently
preceeded
by
a
session
of
happy
,
family
rough-housing
.
To
outsiders
,
the
Blacks
seem
to
be
an
ordinary
,
happy
family
,
and
they
are
-
but
with
a
difference
.
They
know
the
value
of
being
just
that
-
an
ordinary
,
happy
family
.
Family_Service
has
helped
hundreds
of
families
in_this
area
.
Perhaps
to
some
their
work
does
not
seem
particularly
vital
.
But
to
the
families
it
serves
,
their
help
cannot
be
measured
.
Family_Service
could
not
open
its
doors
to
a
single
family
without
the
financial
support
of
the
United_Givers_Fund
.
Anticipated
heavy
traffic
along
the
Skyline_Drive
failed
to
materialize
yesterday
,
park
rangers
said
,
and
those
who
made
the
trip
got
a
leisurely
view
of
the
fall
colors
through
skies
swept
clear
of
haze
.
