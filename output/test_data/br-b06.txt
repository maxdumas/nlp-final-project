The
study
of
the
St._Louis
area
's
economic
prospects
prepared
for
the
Construction_Industry
Joint_Conference
confirms
and
reinforces
both
the
findings
of
the
Metropolitan
St._Louis
Survey
of
1957
and
the
easily
observed
picture
of
the
Missouri-Illinois
countryside
.
St._Louis
sits
in_the_center
of
a
relatively
slow-growing
and
in
some
places
stagnant
mid-continent
region
.
Slackened
regional
demand
for
St._Louis
goods
and
services
reflects
the
region
's
relative
lack
of
purchasing
power
.
Not
all
St._Louis
industries
,
of_course
,
have
a
market
area
confined
to
the
immediate
neighborhood
.
But
for
those
which
do
,
the
slow
growth
of
the
area
has
a
retarding
effect
on
the
metropolitan
core
.
The
city
has
a
stake
in
stimulating
growth
and
purchasing
power
throughout
outstate
Missouri
and
Southern_Illinois
.
Gov._Dalton
's
new
Commerce
and
Industry
Commission
is
moving
to
create
a
nine-state
regional
group
in
a
collective
effort
to
attract
new
industry
.
That
is
one
approach
.
Another
would
be
to
take
the
advice
of
Dr._Elmer_Ellis
,
president
of
the
University
of
Missouri
,
and
provide_for
an
impartial
professional
analysis
of
Missouri
's
economy
.
He
says
the
state
,
in_order_to
proceed
with
economic
development
,
must
develop
an
understanding
of
how
the
various
parts
of
its
economy
fit
together
and
dovetail
into
the
national
economy
.
The
research_center
of
the
University
's
School
of
Business
and
Public_Administration
is
prepared
to
undertake
the
analysis
Dr._Ellis
has
been
talking_about
.
He
and
Dean_John_W._Schwada
of
the
Business_School
outlined
the
project
at
a
recent
conference
.
The
University
can
make
a
valuable
contribution
to
the
state
's
economic
development
through
such
a
study
.
In
Southern_Illinois
,
the
new
federal
program
of
help
to
economically
depressed
areas
ought
to
provide
some
stimulus
to
growth
.
The
Carbondale_Industrial_Development_Corp.
has
obtained
a
$
500000
loan
to
help
defray
the
cost
of
remodeling
a
city-owned
factory
to
accommodate
production
that
will
provide
500
new
jobs
.
Carbondale
is
in
the
Herrin-Murphysboro-West_Frankfort
labor_market
,
where
unemployment
has
been
substantially
higher
than
the
national
average
.
The
Federal
program
eventually
should
have
a
favorable
impact
on
Missouri
's
depressed
areas
,
and
in_the_long_run
that
will
benefit
St._Louis
as_well
.
Politics-ridden
St._Clair
county
in
Illinois
presents
another
piece
of
the
problem
of
metropolitan
development
.
More
industrial
acreage
lies
vacant
in
St._Clair
county
than
in
any
other
jurisdiction
in
the
St._Louis
area
.
The
unstable
political
situation
there
represents
one
reason
new
plants
shy_away_from
the
East_Side
.
And_then
there
is
St._Louis
county
,
where
the
Democratic
leadership
has
shown
little
appreciation
of
the
need
for
sound
zoning
,
of
the
important
relationship
between
proper
land
use
and
economic
growth
.
St._Louis
county
under
its
present
leadership
also
has
largely
closed
its
eyes
to
the
need
for
governmental
reform
,
and
permitted
parochial
interests
to
take
priority
over
area-wide
interests
.
Some
plant-location
specialists
take
these
signs
to
mean
St._Louis
county
does
n't
want
industry
,
and
so
they
avoid
the
area
,
and
more
jobs
are
lost
.
Metropolitan
St._Louis
's
relatively
slow
rate_of_growth
ought
to
be
a
priority
concern
of
the
political
,
business
,
civic
and
other
leaders
on
both
sides
of
the
Mississippi
.
Without
a
great
acceleration
in
the
metropolitan
area
's
economy
,
there
will
not
be
sufficient
jobs
for
the
growing
numbers
of
youngsters
,
and
St._Louis
will
slip
into
second-class
status
.
Many_of
our
very
best
friends
are
reformers
.
Still
we
must
confess
that
sometimes
some
of
them
go
too
far
.
Take
,
for_example
,
the
reformers
among
New_York_City
's
Democrats
.
Having
whipped
Mr._De_Sapio
in
the
primaries
and
thus
come_into
control
of
Tammany_Hall
,
they
have
changed
the
name
to
Chatham_Hall
.
Even_though
headquarters
actually
have
been
moved_into
the
Chatham
building
,
do
they
believe
that
they
can
make
the
new
name
stick
?
Granted
that
the
Tammany
name
and
the
Tammany
tiger
often
were
regarded_as
badges
of
political
shame
,
the
sachems
of
the
Hall
also
have
a_few
good
marks
to
their
credit
.
But
it
is
tradition
rather_than
the
record
which
balks
at
the
expunging
of
the
Tammany
name
.
After_all
,
it
goes_back
to
the
days
in_which
sedition
was
not
un-American
,
the
days
in_which
the
Sons
of
St._Tammany
conspired
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence
-
the_British
government
that_is
.
Further
,
do
our
reforming
friends
really
believe
that
the
cartoonists
will
consent
to
the
banishment
of
the
tiger
from
their
zoo
?
They
will
-
when
they
give_up
the
donkey
and
the
elephant
.
Instead
of
attempting
the
impossible
,
why
not
a
publicity
campaign
to
prove
that
all
the
tiger
's
stripes
are
not
black
?
That
might
go_over
.
The
White_House
itself
has
taken
steps
to
remove
a
former
Batista
official
,
Col._Mariano_Faget
,
from
his
preposterous
position
as
interrogator
of
Cuban
refugees
for
the
Immigration_Service
.
The
Faget
appointment
was
preposterous
on
several
grounds
.
The
Kennedy_Administration
had
assured
anti-Castro
Cubans
that
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
associates
of
Dictator_Batista
.
Using
a
Batista
man
to
screen
refugees
represented
a
total
misunderstanding
of
the
democratic
forces
which
alone
can
effectively
oppose
Castro
.
Moreover
,
Col._Faget
's
information
on
Cuba
was
too
outdated
to
be
useful
in
``
screening
''
Castro
agents
;
the
Colonel
fled
to
the
friendly
haven
of
the
Dominican
dictatorship
as
soon
as
Castro
seized
power
.
And
while
he
had
headed
Batista
's
anti-Communist
section
,
the
Batista
regime
did
not
disturb
the
Communists
so_much
as
more
open
opponents
who
were
alleged
to
be
Communists
.
Responsibility
for
the
Faget
appointment
rests
with
Gen._J._M.
swing
,
an
Eisenhower
appointee
as
head
of
the
Immigration_Service
.
Gen._Swing
has
received
public
attention
before_this
for
abuse
of
some
of
the
prerogatives
of
his
office
.
His
official
term
expired
last
summer
.
Some
reports
say
he
was
rescued
from
timely
retirement
by
his
friend
,
Congressman_Walter
of
Pennsylvania
,
at
a
moment
when
the
Kennedy_Administration
was
diligently
searching
for
all
the
House
votes
it
could
get
.
Congressman_Walter
has
been
all-powerful
in
immigration
matters
,
but
he
has
announced
plans
to
retire
in
1962
.
At
that
point
the
Administration
will
have
little
reason
to
hang_on
to
Gen._Swing
.
The
Faget
case
was
the
kind_of
salvage
job
the
Administration
should
not
have
to
repeat
.
As
President
,
Dwight_D._Eisenhower
often
assumed
a
role
aloof
from
the
strife
of
partisan
politics
.
As
a
former
President
,
however
,
Mr._Eisenhower
abandoned
this
role
to
engage
in
partisan
sniping
during
a
New_York
Republican
rally
,
and
generally
missed
his
target
.
Mr._Eisenhower
seized
upon
the
incident
of
the
postcard
lost
by
a
Peace_Corps
girl
in
Nigeria
to
attack
the
entire
Corps
as
a
``
juvenile
experiment
''
and
to
suggest
sending
a
Corps
member
to
the
moon
.
This
was
juvenile
ridicule
.
Nowhere
did
the
speaker
recognize
the
serious
purpose
of
the
Corps
or
its
welcome
reception
abroad
.
His
words
were
the
more
ungracious
to
come
from
a
man
who
lent
his
name
to
the
Eisenhower_Exchange
Fellowships
dedicated_to
the
same
goal
of
international
understanding
.
The
former
President
blithely
ignored
recent
history
in
speaking
of
``
dollarette
''
dollars
under
Kennedy_Administration
fiscal
policies
.
It
was
the
Eisenhower_Administration
which
produced
the
largest
peacetime
deficit
.
Finally
,
Mr._Eisenhower
found
nothing
but
confusion
in
Washington
.
This
statement
recalls
the
1959
Berlin
crisis
,
when
President_Eisenhower
first
told
reporters
that
Berlin
could
not
be
defended
with
conventional
weapons
and_then
added
that
a
nuclear
defense
was
out
of
the
picture
too
.
The
crisis
has
been
renewed
since
then
but
the
confusion
has
hardly
been
compounded
.
Ex-Presidents
,
relieved
of
accountability
for
policy
,
sometimes
seem
to
feel
free_of
accountability
for
their
words
.
Some
of
former
President_Truman
's
off-the-cuff
discourses
have
been
in_that
vein
.
Nobody
can
deny
the
right
of
former
Chief_Executives
to
take_part
in
politics
,
but
the
American
people
expect
them
always
to
remember
the
obligations
of
national
leadership
and
to
treat
issues
with
a
sense_of_responsibility
.
This
is
a
matter
of
respect
for
the
Presidency
.
Mr._Eisenhower
's
New_York
speech
does
not
encourage
respect
for
that
or
for
his
elder
statesmanship
.
The
Queen_Mary
has
long
been
a
symbol
of
speed
,
luxury
,
and
impeccable
British
service
on
the
high
seas
.
Reports
that
the
venerable
liner
,
which
has
been
in_service
since
1936
,
was
to
be
retired
struck
a
nostalgic
note
in
many_of
us
.
But
the
Cunard
line
,
influenced
by
unpleasant
economic
facts
and
not
sentiment
,
has
decided
to
keep
the
Queen_Mary
in_service
until
next
Spring
at_least
.
A
new
queen
,
with
the
prosaic
title
of
Q3
,
had
been
planned
for
several
years
to
replace
the
Queen_Mary
.
The_British
government
,
concerned
about
the
threat
of
unemployment
in
the
shipbuilding_industry
,
had
put_through
a
bill
to
give
Cunard
loans
and
grants
totaling
$
50400000
toward
the
$
84000000
cost
of
a
new
75000
-
ton
passenger
liner
.
Since
1957
,
more_and_more
trans-Atlantic
passengers
have
been
crossing
by
air
.
Economy
class
fares
and
charter
flights
have
attracted
almost
all
new
passengers
to
the
airlines
.
Competition
from
other
steamship_lines
has
cut
Cunard
's
share
of
sea
passengers
from
one-third
to
one-fourth
and
this
year
the
line
showed
a
marked
drop
of
profits
on
the
Atlantic
run
.
The
Cunard
line
has
under_consideration
replacing
the
Queen_Mary
with
a
ship
smaller
than
75000
tons
.
This
would
be
cheaper
to
operate
and
could
be
used
for
cruises
during
the
lean
winter
months
.
Also
under_consideration
is
an
increased
investment
in
Cunard_Eagle
Airways
which
has
applied
to
serve
New_York
.
The
decline
of
the
Cunard
line
from
its
position
of
dominance
in
Atlantic
travel
is
a
significant
development
in
the
history
of
transportation
.
Gen._Maxwell_Taylor
's
statement
in
Saigon
that
he
is
``
very_much
encouraged
''
about
the
chances
of
the
pro-Western
government
of
Viet_Nam
turning_back
Communist
guerrilla
attacks
comes_close
to
an
announcement
that
he
will
not
recommend
dispatching
United_States
troops
to
bolster
the
Vietnamese
Army
.
Gen._Taylor
will
report
to
President_Kennedy
in
a_few
days
on
the
results
of
his
visit
to
South
Viet_Nam
and
,
judging
from
some
of
his
remarks
to
reporters
in
the
Far_East
,
he
is
likely
to
urge
a
more
efficient
mobilization
of
Vietnamese
military
,
economic
,
political
and
other
resources
.
There
was
good
reason
for
Gen._Taylor
to
make
an
inspection
trip
at
this
time
.
Communist
guerrillas
recently
have
been
reported
increasing
their
activities
and
the
great
flood
of
the
Mekong_River
has
interposed
a
new
crisis
.
South
Viet_Nam
's
rice
surplus
for
next
year
-
more_than
300000
tons
-
may
have
been
destroyed
.
The
Viet_Cong
,
the
Communist
rebels
,
may
have
lost
their
stored
grain
and
arms
factories
.
The
rebels
may
try
to
seize
what
is
left
of
the
October
harvest
when
the
floods
recede
and
the
monsoon
ends
in
November
.
Nothing
that
is
likely
to
happen
,
however
,
should
prompt
the
sending
of
United_States
soldiers
for
other_than
instructional
missions
.
The
Indochina
struggle
was
a
war
to
stay
out
of
in
1954
,
when
Gen._Ridgway
estimated
it
would
take
a
minimum
of
10
to
15
divisions
at
the
outset
to
win
a
war
the_French
were
losing
.
It
is
a
war
to
stay
out
of
today
,
especially
in_view
of
the
fact
that
President_Ngo_Dinh_Diem
apparently
does
not
want
United_States
troops
.
He
may
want
additional
technical
help
,
and
this
should
be
forthcoming
.
South
Viet_Nam
has
received
$
1450000000
in
United_States
aid
since
1954
and
the
rate
of
assistance
has
been
stepped_up
since
Vice_President
Lyndon_B._Johnson
's
visit
last
May
.
Gen._Taylor
,
the
President
's
special
military
adviser
,
is
a
level-headed
officer
who
is
not
likely
to
succumb
to
propaganda
or
pressure
.
It
is
probable
that
his
recommendations
will
be
informed
and
workable
,
and
that
they
will
not
lead
to
involving
the
United_States
in
an
Asian
morass
.
Gov._John_M._Dalton
,
himself
a
lawyer
and
a
man
of
long
service
in
government
,
spoke
with
rich
background
and
experience
when
he
said
in
an
address
here
that
lawyers
ought
to
quit
sitting
in
the
Missouri
General_Assembly
,
or
quit
accepting
fees
from
individuals
and
corporations
who
have
controversies
with
or
axes_to_grind
with
the
government
and
who
are
retained
,
not
because
of
their
legal
talents
,
but
because
of
their
government
influence
.
