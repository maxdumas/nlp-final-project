To
write
a
play
,
the
dramatist
once
needed
an
idea
plus
the
imagination
,
the
knowledge
of
life
and
the
craft
to
develop
it
.
Nowadays
,
more_and_more
,
all
he
needs
is
someone
else
's
book
.
To
get_started
,
he
does
not
scan
the
world
about
him
;
he
and
his
prospective
producer
just
read
the
bestseller
lists
.
So_far
this
season
,
Broadway
's
premieres
have
included
twice_as
many
adaptations
and
imports
as
original
American
stage
plays
.
Of
straight
dramas
,
there
are
All_the_Way
Home
,
which
owes
much
of
its
poetic
power
to
the
James_Agee
novel
,
A
Death
in
the
Family
;
The
Wall
,
awkwardly
based
on
the
John_Hersey
novel
;
Advise
and
Consent
,
lively
but
shallow
theater
drawn
from
the
mountainously
detailed
bestseller
;
Face
of
a
Hero
(
closed
)
,
based
on
a
Pierre_Boulle
novel
.
The
only
original
works
attempting
to
reach
any
stature
:
Tennessee_Williams
'
disappointing
domestic
comedy
,
Period
of
Adjustment
,
and
Arthur_Laurents
'
clever
but
empty
Invitation
to
a
March
.
Clearly
the_most
provocative
plays
are
all
imported
originals
-
A
Taste_of
Honey
,
by
Britain
's
young
(
19
when
she
wrote
it
)
Shelagh_Delaney
;
Becket
,
by
France
's
Jean_Anouilh
;
The
Hostage
(
closed
)
,
by
Ireland
's
Brendan_Behan
.
Among
the
musicals
,
Camelot
came
from
T._H._White
's
The
Once
and
Future_King
,
and
novels
were
the
sources
of
the
less_than
momentous
Tenderloin
and
Do
Re_Mi
.
Wildcat
and
The
Unsinkable_Molly_Brown
were
originals
,
but
pretty
bad
,
leaving
top
honors
again
to
an
import
-
the
jaunty
and
charmingly
French
Irma_La_Douce
.
The
only
other
works
at
least
technically
original
were
dreary
farces
-
Send
Me
No
Flowers
(
closed
)
,
Under
the
Yum-Yum_Tree
,
Critic
's
Choice
.
In
the
forthcoming
The
Conquering_Hero
and
Carnival
,
Broadway
is
not
even
adapting
books
,
but
reconverting
old
movies
(
Hail
the
Conquering_Hero
and
Lili
)
.
Originals
are
not
necessarily
good
and
adaptations
are
not
necessarily
bad
.
Some
memorable
plays
have
been
drawn
from
books
,
notably
Life
with
Father
and
Diary
of
Anne_Frank
.
And
particularly
in
the
musical
field
,
adaptations
have
long
been
the
rule
,
from
Die_Fledermaus
and
The
Merry
Widow
to
Oklahoma
!
and
My
Fair_Lady
.
As
Critic_Walter_Kerr
points_out
:
``
Adaptations
,
so_long
as
they
are
good
,
still
qualify
as
creative
''
.
And
other
defenders
invariably
argue
that
,
after_all
,
Shakespeare
and
Moliere
were
adapters
too
.
The
difference
is
that
the
masters
took
the
bare
frame
of
a
plot
and
filled
it
with
their
own
world
;
most
modern
adapters
totally
accept
the
world
of
a
book
,
squeeze
it
dry
of
life
,
and
add
only
one
contribution
of
their
own
:
stage
technique
.
The_most
frequent
excuse
for
the
prevalence
of
unoriginals
and
tested
imports
is
increasing
production
expense
-
producers
cannot
afford
to
take_chances
.
But
that
explanation
is
only
partly
true
.
Off-Broadway
,
where
production
is
still
comparatively
cheap
,
is
proving
itself
only
slightly
more
original
.
Laudably
enough
,
it
is
offering
classics
and
off-beat
imports
,
but
last
week
only
one
U._S.
original
was
on
the
boards
,
Robert_D._Hock
's
stunning
Civil_War
work
,
Borak
.
The
real
trouble
seems
to
be
the
failing
imagination
of
U._S.
playwrights
.
He
:
``
Come
with
me
to
the
casbah
''
.
She
:
``
By
subway
or
cab
''
?
That
exchange
was
not_only
possible
but
commonplace
last
week
in
Manhattan
,
as
more_and_more
New
Yorkers
were
discovering
29
th
Street
and
Eighth_Avenue
,
where
half_a_dozen
small
nightclubs
with
names
like
Arabian_Nights
,
Grecian
Palace
and
Egyptian
Gardens
are
the
American
inpost
of
belly_dancing
.
Several
more
will
open
soon
.
Their
burgeoning
popularity
may
be
a
result
of
the
closing
of
the
52
nd
Street
burlesque
joints
,
but
curiously
enough
their
atmosphere
is
almost
always
familial
-
neighborhood
saloons
with
a_bit
of
epidermis
.
The
belly
boites
,
with
their
papier-mache
palm_trees
or
hand-painted
Ionic
columns
,
heretofore
existed
mainly
on
the
patronage
of
Greek
and
Turkish
families
.
Customers
often
bring
their
children
;
between
performances
,
enthusiastic
young_men
from
the
audience
will
take_the_floor
to
demonstrate
their
own
amateur
graces
.
Except
for
the
odd
uptown
sex
maniac
or
an
overeager
Greek
sailor
,
the
people
watch
in
calm
absorption
.
Small
,
shirt-sleeved
orchestras
play
in
2
4
or
4
4
time
,
using
guitars
,
violins
,
and
more
alien
instruments
with
names
that
would
open_Sesame
:
the
oud
,
grandfather
of
the
lute
;
the
darbuka
,
a
small
drum
with
the
treelike
shape
of
a
roemer
glass
;
the
def
,
a
low-pitched
tambourine
.
The
girls
sit
quietly
with
the
musicians
,
wearing
prim
dresses
or
plain
,
secretarial
shifts
,
until
it
is
time
to
go
off
to
a
back_room
and
reappear
in
the
spare
uniform
of
the
harem
.
If
a
dancer
is
good
,
she
suggests
purely
and
superbly
the
fundamental
mechanics
of
ancestry
and
progeny
-
the
continuum
of
mankind
.
But
a
great
many_of
what
Variety
calls
the
``
cooch
terpers
''
are
considerably
less
cosmic
than
that
.
Each
dancer
follows
the
ancient
Oriental
pattern
-
she
glides
sideways
with
shoulders
motionless
while
her
stomach
migrates
,
and
,
through
breathing
and
muscle
control
,
she
sends
ripples
across
her
body
to
the
fingertips
and
away
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
.
This
is
done
at
varying
speeds
,
ranging
from
the
slow
and
fast
Shifte_Telli
(
a
musical
term
meaning
double
strings
)
to
the
fastest
,
ecstatic
Karshilama
(
meaning
greetings
or
welcome
)
.
The
New_York
dancers
are
highly
eclectic
,
varying
the
pattern
with
all
kinds
of
personal
improvisations
,
back
bends
or
floor
crawls
.
But
they
do
not
strip
.
The
striptease
is
crass
;
the
belly_dance
leaves
more
to
the
imagination
.
When
a
dancer
does
well
,
she
provokes
a
quiet
bombardment
of
dollar_bills
-
although
the
Manhattan
clubs
prohibit
the
more
cosmopolitan
practice
of
slipping
the
tips
into
the
dancers
'
costumes
.
With
tips
,
the
girls
average
between
$
150
and
$
200
a
week
,
depending_on
basic
salary
.
Although
they
are
forbidden
to
sit
with
the
customers
,
the
dancers
are
sometimes
proffered
drinks
,
and
most_of
them
can
bolt
one
down
in
mid-shimmy
.
All_over
the
country
,
belly
clubs
have
never
been
bigger
,
especially
in
Detroit
,
Boston
and
Chicago
,
and
even
in
small_towns
;
one
of
the
best
dancers
,
a
Turkish
girl
named
Semra
,
works
at
a
roadhouse
outside
Bristol
,
Conn.
.
The
girls
are
kept
booked
and
moving
by
several
agents
,
notably
voluble
,
black-bearded
Murat_Somay
,
a
Manhattan_Turk
who
is
the
Sol_Hurok
of
the
central
abdomen
.
He
can
offer
nine
Turkish
girls
,
plans
to
import
at_least
15
more
.
But
a
great
many_of
the
dancers
are
more_or_less
native
.
Sometimes
they
get
their
initial
experience
in
church
haflis
,
conducted
by
Lebanese
and
Syrians
in
the
U._S.
,
where
they
dance
with
just_as
few
veils
across
their
bodies
as
in
nightclubs
.
As
the
girls
come
to
belly_dancing
from
this
and
other
origins
,
the
melting_pot
has
never
bubbled
more
intriguingly
.
Some
Manhattan
examples
:
Jemela
(
surname
:
Gerby
)
,
23
,
seems
Hong_Kong
Oriental
but
has
a
Spanish
father
and
an
Indian
mother
,
was_born
in
America
and
educated
at
Holy_Cross_Academy
and
Textile
High_School
,
says
she
learned
belly_dancing
at
family
picnics
.
Serene
(
Mrs._Wilson
)
,
23
,
was_born
in
Budapest
and
raised
in
Manhattan
.
Daughter
of
a
gypsy
mother
who
taught
her
to
dance
,
she
is
one
of
the
few
really
beautiful
girls
in
the
New_York
casbah
,
with
dark
eyes
and
dark
,
waist-length
hair
,
the
face
of
an
adolescent
patrician
and
a
lithe
,
glimmering
body
.
Many
belly_dancers
are
married
,
but
Serene
is
one
of
the
few
who
will
admit
it
.
Marlene
(
surname
:
Adamo
)
,
25
,
a
Brazilian
divorcee
who
learned
the
dance
from
Arabic
friends
in
Paris
,
now
lives
on
Manhattan
's
West_Side
,
is
about
the
best
belly_dancer
working
the
casbah
,
loves
it
so_much
that
she
dances
on
her
day_off
.
She
has
the
small
,
highly_developed
body
of
a
prime
athlete
,
and
holds
in
contempt
the
``
girls
who
just
move
sex
''
.
Leila
(
Malia_Phillips
)
,
25
,
is
a
Greenwich_Village
painter
of
Persianesque
miniatures
who
has
red
hair
that
cascades
almost
to
her
ankles
.
A
graduate
of
Hollywood
High_School
,
she
likes
to
imagine
herself
,
as
she
takes_the_floor
,
``
a
village
girl
coming_in
to
a
festival
''
.
Gloria
(
surname
:
Ziraldo
)
,
circa
30
,
who
was_born
in
Italy
and
once
did
``
chorus
work
''
in
Toronto
,
has
been
around
longer
than
most_of
the
others
,
wistfully
remembers
the
old
days
when
``
we
used_to
get
the
seamen
from
the
ships
,
you
know
,
with
big
turtleneck
sweaters
and
handkerchiefs
and
all
.
But
the
ships
are
very
slow
now
,
and
we
do
n't
get
so
many
sailors
any_more
''
.
The
uptown
crowd
has
moved_in
,
and
what
girl
worth
her
seventh
veil
would
trade
a
turtleneck
sweater
for
a
button-down
collar
?
Of
the
handful
of
painters
that
Austria
has
produced
in
the
20
th
century
,
only
one
,
Oskar_Kokoschka
,
is
widely
known
in
the
U._S.
.
This
state
of
unawareness
may
not
last
much
longer
.
For
ten
years
a
small
group
of
European
and
U._S.
critics
has
been
calling_attention_to
the
half-forgotten
Austrian
expressionist
Egon_Schiele
,
who
died
42
years
ago
at
the
age
of
28
.
The
critics
'
campaign
finally
inspired
the
first
major
U._S.
exhibit
of
Schiele
's
works
.
The
show
has
been
to
Boston
and
Manhattan
,
will
in_time
reach
Pittsburgh
and
Minneapolis
.
Last
week
it
opened
at
the
J._B.
Speed
Museum
in
Louisville
,
at
the
very
moment
that
a
second
Schiele
exhibit
was
being
made
ready
at
the
Felix_Landau
gallery
in
Los_Angeles
.
Schiele
's
paintings
are
anything
but
pleasant
.
His
people
(
see
color
)
are
angular
and
knobby-knuckled
,
sometimes
painfully
stretched
,
sometimes
grotesquely
foreshortened
.
His
colors
are
dark
and
murky
,
and
his
landscapes
and
cityscapes
seem
swallowed
in
gloom
.
But
he
painted
some
of
the
boldest
and
most
original
pictures
of
his
time
,
and
even
after
nearly
half
a
century
,
the
tense
,
tormented
world
he
put
on
canvas
has
lost
none
of
its
fascination
.
The
son
of
a
railway
stationmaster
,
Schiele
lived
most_of
his
childhood
in
the
drowsy
Danubian
town
of
Tulln
,
14
miles
northwest
of
Vienna
.
He
was
an
emotional
,
lonely
boy
who
spent
so_much
time
turning_out
drawings
that
he
did
scarcely_any
schoolwork
.
When
he
was
15
,
his
parents
finally
allowed
him
to
attend
classes
at
the
Academy
of
Fine_Arts
in
Vienna
.
Even
there
he
did
not
last
for
long
.
Cried
one
professor
after
a_few
months
of
Student_Schiele
's
tantrums
and
rebellion
:
``
The_devil
himself
must
have
defecated
you
into
my
classroom
''
!
For_a_while
his
work
was
influenced
deeply
by
the_French
impressionists
,
and
by
the
patterned
,
mosaic-like
paintings
of
Gustav_Klimt
,
then
the
dean
of
Austrian
art
.
Gradually
Schiele
evolved
a
somber
style
of
his
own
-
and
he
had
few
inhibitions
about
his
subject_matter
.
His
pictures
were
roundly
denounced
as
``
the_most
disgusting
things
one
has
ever
seen
in
Vienna
''
.
He
himself
was
once
convicted
of
painting
erotica
and
jailed
for
24
days
-
the
first
three
of_which
he
spent
desperately
trying
to
make
paintings
on
the
wall
with
his
own
spittle
.
For
years
he
wore
hand-me-down
suits
and
homemade
paper
collars
,
was
even
driven
to
scrounging
for
cigarette_butts
in
Vienna
's
gutters
.
Drafted
into
the
Austrian
army
,
he
rebelliously
rejected
discipline
,
wangled
a
Vienna
billet
,
went_on
painting
.
It
was
not
until
the
last
year
of
his
life
that
he
had
his
first
moneymaking
show
.
The
unabashed
sexuality
of
so
many_of
this
paintings
was
not
the
only
thing
that
kept
the
public
at_bay
:
his
view
of
the
world
was
one
of
almost
unrelieved
tragedy
,
and
it
was
too_much
even
for
morbid-minded
Vienna
.
He
was
obsessed
by
disease
and
poverty
,
by
the
melancholy
of
old_age
and
the
tyranny
of
lust
.
The
children
he
painted
were
almost
always
in
rags
,
his
portraits
were
often
ruthless
to_the_point
of
ugliness
,
and
his
nudes
-
including
several
self-portraits
-
were
stringy
,
contorted
and
strangely
pathetic
.
The
subject
he
liked
most
was
the
female_body
,
which
he
painted
in
every
state
-
naked
,
half-dressed
,
muffled
to
the
ears
,
sitting
primly
in
a
chair
,
lying
tauntingly
on
a
bed
or
locked
in
an
embrace
.
