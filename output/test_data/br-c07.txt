Some
of
the
New_York
Philharmonic
musicians
who
live
in
the
suburbs
spent
yesterday
morning
digging
themselves
free
from
snow
.
A
tiny
handful
never
did
make
the
concert
.
But
,
after
a
fifteen-minute
delay
,
the
substantially
complete
Philharmonic
assembled
on
stage
for
the
afternoon
's
proceedings
.
They
faced
a
rather
small
audience
,
as
quite_a_few
subscribers
apparently
had
decided
to
forego
the
pleasures
of
the
afternoon
.
It
was
an
excellent
concert
.
Paul_Paray
,
rounding_out
his
current
stint
with
the
orchestra
,
is
a
solid
musician
,
and
the
Philharmonic
plays
for
him
.
Their
collaboration
in
the
Beethoven_Second_Symphony
was
lucid
,
intelligent
and
natural
sounding
.
It
was
not
a
heavy
,
ponderous
Beethoven
.
The
music
sang
nicely
,
sprinted
evenly
when
necessary
,
was
properly
accented
and
balanced
.
The
Franck
symphonic_poem
,
``
Psyche
''
,
is
a
lush
,
sweet-sounding
affair
that
was
pleasant
to
encounter
once_again
.
Fortunate
for
the
music
itself
,
it
is
not
too
frequent
a
visitor
;
if
it
were
,
its
heavily
chromatic
harmonies
would
soon
become
cloying
.
Mr._Paray
resisted
the
temptation
to
over-emphasize
the
melodic
elements
of
the
score
.
He
did
not
let
the
strings
,
for_instance
,
weep
,
whine
or
get
hysterical
.
His
interpretation
was
a
model
of
refinement
and
accuracy
.
And
in
the
Prokofieff
C
major
Piano_Concerto
,
with
Zadel_Skolovsky
as
soloist
,
he
was
an
admirable
partner
.
Mr._Skolovsky
's
approach
to
the
concerto
was
bold
,
sweeping
and
tonally
percussive
.
He
swept_through
the
music
with
ease
,
in
a
non-sentimental
and
ultra-efficient
manner
.
An
impressive
technician
,
Mr._Skolovsky
has
fine
rhythm
,
to_boot
.
His
tone
is
the
weakest
part
of
his
equipment
;
it
tends
to
be
hard
and
colorless
.
A
school_of_thought
has
it
that
those
attributes
are
exactly
what
this
concerto
needs
.
It
is
,
after_all
,
a
non-romantic
work
(
even
with
the
big
,
juicy
melody
of
the
second
movement
)
;
and
the
composer
himself
was
called
the
``
age
of
steel
pianist
''
.
But
granted
all
this
,
one
still
would
have
liked
to
have
heard
a_little
more
tonal
nuance
than
Mr._Skolovsky
supplied
.
Taken
as_a_whole
,
though
,
it
was
a
strong
performance
from
both
pianist
and
orchestra
.
Mr._Skolovsky
fully
deserved
the
warm
reception
he
received
.
A
new
work
on
the
program
was
Nikolai_Lopatnikoff
's
``
Festival_Overture
''
,
receiving
its
first
New_York
hearing
.
This
was
composed
last
year
as
a
salute
to
the
automobile_industry
.
It
is
not
program
music
,
though
.
It
runs
a_little
more_than
ten
minutes
,
is
workmanlike
,
busy
,
methodical
and
featureless
.
``
La_Gioconda
''
,
like
it
or
not
,
is
a
singer
's
opera
.
And
so
,
of_course
,
it
is
a
fan
's
opera
as_well
.
Snow
or
no
,
the
fans
were
present
in_force
at
the
Metropolitan_Opera
last
night
for
a
performance
of
the
Ponchielli
work
.
So
the
plot
creaks
,
the
sets
are
decaying
,
the
costumes
are
pre-historic
,
the
orchestra
was
sloppy
and
not_very_well
connected
with
what
the
singers
were
doing
.
After_all
,
the
opera
has
juicy
music
to
sing
and
the
goodies
are
well
distributed
,
with
no_less_than
six
leading
parts
.
One
of
those
parts
is
that
of
evil
,
evil
Barnaba
,
the
spy
.
His
wicked
deeds
were
carried_on
by
Anselmo_Colzani
,
who
was
taking
the
part
for_the_first_time
with
the
company
.
He
has
the
temperament
and
the
stage
presence
for
a
rousing
villain
and
he
sang
with
character
and
strong
tone
.
What
was
lacking
was
a
real
sense
of
phrase
,
the
kind_of
legato
singing
that
would
have
added
a
dimension
of
smoothness
to
what
is
,
after_all
,
a
very
oily
character
.
Regina_Resnik
as
Laura
and
Cesare_Siepi
as
Alvise
also
were
new_to
the
cast
,
but
only
with_respect_to
this
season
;
they
have
both
sung
these
parts
here
before
.
Laura
is
a
good
role
for
Miss_Resnik
,
and
she
gave
it
force
,
dramatic
color
and
passion
.
Mr._Siepi
was
,
as
always
,
a
consummate
actor
;
with
a_few
telling
strokes
he
characterized
Alvise
magnificently
.
Part
of_this
characterization
was
,
of_course
,
accomplished
with
the
vocal
chords
.
His
singing
was
strong
and
musical
;
unfortunately
his
voice
was
out
of
focus
and
often
spread
in
quality
.
Eileen_Farrell
in
the
title_role
,
Mignon_Dunn
as
La_Cieca
and
Richard_Tucker
as
Enzo
were
holdovers
from
earlier
performances
this
season
,
and
all
contributed
to
a
vigorous
performance
.
If
only
they
and
Fausto_Cleva
in
the_pit
had
got_together
a_bit
more
.
``
Melodious
birds
sing
madrigals
''
saith
the
poet
and
no
better
description
of
the
madrigaling
of
the
Deller_Consort
could
be
imagined
.
Their
Vanguard
album
Madrigal
Masterpieces
(
BG
609
;
stereo
BGS
5031
)
is
a
good
sample
of
the
special
,
elegant
art
of
English
madrigal
singing
.
It
also
makes
a
fine
introduction
to
the
international
art_form
with
good_examples
of
Italian
and
English
madrigals
plus
several
French
``
chansons
''
.
The_English
have
managed
to
hold
onto
their
madrigal
tradition
better
than
anyone
else
.
The
original
impulses
came
to
England
late
(
in
the
sixteenth
century
)
and
continue
strong
long
after
everyone
else
had
gone_on
to
the
baroque
basso_continuo
,
sonatas
,
operas
and
the_like
.
Even
after
Elizabethan
traditions
were
weakened
by
the
Cromwellian
interregnum
,
the
practice
of
singing
together
-
choruses
,
catches
and
glees
-
always
flourished
.
The_English
never_again
developed
a
strong
native
music
that
could
obliterate
the
traces
of
an
earlier
great
age
the
way
,
say
,
the
opera
in
Italy
blotted_out
the
Italian
madrigal
.
Latter-day
interest
in
Elizabethan
singing
dates
well
back
into
the
nineteenth
century
in
England
,
much
ahead
of
similar
revivals
in
other
countries
.
As
a
result
no
comparable
literature
of
the
period
is
better
known
and
better
studied
nor
more_often
performed
than
the_English
madrigal
.
Naturally
,
Mr._Deller
and
the
other
singers
in
his
troupe
are
most
charming
and
elegant
when
they
are
squarely
in
their
tradition
and
singing
music
by
their
countrymen
:
William_Byrd
,
Thomas_Morley
and
Thomas_Tomkins
.
There
is
an
almost
instrumental
quality
to
their
singing
,
with
a
tendency
to
lift
out
important
lines
and
make
them
lead
the
musical
texture
.
Both
techniques
give
the
music
purity
and
clarity
.
Claude_Jannequin
's
vocal
description
of
a
battle
(
the_French
equivalents
of
tarantara
,
rum-tum-tum
,
and
boom-boom-boom
are
very
picturesque
)
is
lots_of
fun
,
and
the
singers
get
a
sense
of
grace
and
shape
into
other
chansons
by
Jannequin
and
Lassus
.
Only
with
the
more
sensual
,
intense
and
baroque
expressions
of
Marenzio
,
Monteverdi
and
Gesualdo
does
the
singing
seem
a_little
superficial
.
Nevertheless
,
the
musicality
,
accuracy
and
infectious
charm
of
these
performances
,
excellently
reproduced
,
make
it
an
attractive
look-see
at
the
period
.
The
works
are
presented
chronologically
.
Texts
and
translations
are
provided
.
The
elements
of
elegance
and
color
in
Jannequin
are
strong
French
characteristics
.
Baroque
instrumental
music
in
Italy
and
Germany
tends
to
be
strong
,
lively
,
intense
,
controlled
and
quite
abstract
.
In
France
,
it
remained
always
more
picturesque
,
more
dancelike
,
more
full_of
flavor
.
Couperin
and
Rameau
gave
titles
to
nearly
everything
they
wrote
,
not
in
the
later
sense
of
``
program
music
''
but
as
a
kind_of
nonmusical
reference
for
the
close
,
clear
musical
forms
filled
with
keen
wit
and
precise
utterance
.
Both
composers
turn_up
on
new
imports
from
France
.
BAM
is
the
unlikely
name
of
a
French
recording
company
whose
full
label
is
Editions
de
la
boite
a
musique
.
They
specialize
in
out-of-the-way
items
and
old_French
music
naturally
occupies
a
good_deal
of
their
attention
.
Sonates
et
Concerts
Royaux
of
Couperin
le
grand
occupy
two
disks
(
LD056
and
LD060
)
and
reveal
the
impeccable
taste
and
workmanship
of_this
master
-
delicate
,
flexible
and
gemlike
.
The
Concerts
-
Nos.
2
,
6
,
9
,
10
and
14
are
represented
-
are
really
closer
to
chamber
suites
than
to
concertos
in
the
Italian
sense
.
The
sonatas
,
``
La_Francaise
''
,
``
La_Sultane
''
,
``
L
'
Astree
''
and
``
L
'
Imperiale
''
,
are
often
more
elaborately
worked_out
and
,
in_fact
,
show
a
strong
Italian
influence
.
Couperin
also
turns_up
along
with
some
lesser-known
contemporaries
on
a
disk
called
Musique_Francaise_du
18
,
e
Siecle
(
BAM
LD
060
)
.
Jean-Marie_LeClair
still
is
remembered
a_bit
,
but
Bodin
de
Beismortier
,
Corrette
and
Mondonville
are
hardly
household
words
.
What
is
interesting
about
these
chamber
works
here
is
how
they
all
reveal
the
aspect
of
French
music
that
was
moving
toward
the
rococo
.
The
Couperin
``
La_Steinkerque
''
,
with
its
battle
music
,
brevity
,
wit
and
refined
simplicity
,
already
shakes_off
Corelli
and
points
towards
the
mid-century
elegances
that
ended
the
baroque
era
.
If
Couperin
shows
the
fashionable
trend
,
the
others
do
so
all
the
more
.
All
these
records
have
close
,
attractive
sound
and
the
performances
by
a
variety
of
instrumentalists
is
characteristic
.
Rameau
's
Six
Concerts
en
Sextuor
,
recorded
by
L
'
orchestre
de
chambre
Pierre_Menet
(
BAM
LD
046
)
,
turn_out
to
be
harpsichord
pieces
arranged
for
strings
apparently
by
the
composer
himself
.
The
strange
,
delightful
little
character
pieces
with
their
odd
and
sometimes
inexplicable
titles
are
still
evocative
and
gracious
.

.
Rococo
music
-
a_lot_of
it
-
was
played
in
Carnegie_Recital_Hall
on
Saturday
night
in
the
first
of
four
concerts
being
sponsored
this
season
by
a
new
organization
known_as
Globe_Concert_Arts
.
Works
by
J._C._Bach
,
Anton
Craft
,
Joseph_Haydn
,
Giuseppe_Sammartini
,
Comenico_Dragonetti
and
J._G._Janitsch
were
performed
by
seven
instrumentalists
including
Anabel_Brieff
,
flutist
,
Josef_Marx
,
oboist
,
and
Robert_Conant
,
pianist
and
harpsichordist
.
Since
rococo
music
tends
to
be
pretty
and
elegant
above_all
,
it
can
seem
rather
vacuous
to
twentieth-century
ears
that
have
grown
accustomed_to
the
stress
and
dissonances
of
composers
from
Beethoven
to
Boulez
.
Thus
there
was
really
an
excess
of
eighteenth-century
charm
as
one
of
these
light-weight
pieces
followed
another
on
Saturday
night
.
Each
might
find
a
useful
place
in
a
varied
musical
program
,
but
taken
together
they
grew
quite
tiresome
.
The
performances
were
variable
,
those
of
the
full
ensemble
being
generally
satisfying
,
some
by
soloists
proving
rather
trying
.
Ellie_Mao
,
soprano
,
and
Frederick_Fuller
,
baritone
,
presented
a
program
of
folksongs
entitled
``
East_Meets_West
''
in
Carnegie_Recital_Hall
last
night
.
They
were
accompanied
by
Anna_Mi_Lee
,
pianist
.
Selections
from
fifteen
countries
were
sung
as
solos
and
duets
in
a
broad
range
of
languages
.
Songs
from
China
and
Japan
were
reserved
exclusively
for
Miss_Mao
,
who
is
a
native
of
China
,
and
those
of
the_British
Isles
were
sung
by
Mr._Fuller
,
who
is
English
by
birth
.
This
was
not
a
program
intended
to
illustrate
authentic
folk
styles
.
On_the_contrary
,
Miss_Mao
and
Mr._Fuller
chose
many_of
their
arrangements
from
the
works
of
composers
such_as
Mendelssohn
,
Dvorak
,
Canteloube
,
Copland
and
Britten
.
Thre
was
,
therefore
,
more
musical
substance
in
the
concert
than
might
have
been
the
case
otherwise
.
The
performances
were
assured
,
communicative
and
pleasingly
informal
.
What
was
omitted
from
``
A
Neglected_Education
''
were
those
essentials
known_as
``
the
facts
of
life
''
.
Chabrier
's
little
one-act
operetta
,
presented
yesterday
afternoon
at
Town_Hall
,
is
a
fragile
,
precious
little
piece
,
very
French
,
not
without
wit
and
charm
.
The
poor
uneducated
newlywed
,
a
certain
Gontran
de
Boismassif
,
has
his
problems
in
getting
the
necessary
information
.
The
humor
of
the
situation
can
be
imagined
.
It
all
takes_place
in
the
eighteenth
century
.
What
a
silly
,
artificial
way_of_life
,
Chabrier
and
his
librettists
chuckle
.
But
they
wish
they
could
bring
it
back
.
Chabrier
's
delightful
music
stands
just
at
the
point
where
the
classical
,
rationalist
tradition
,
(
handed_down
to
Chabrier
largely
in
the
form
of
operetta
and
salon
music
)
becomes
virtually
neo-classicism
.
The
musical
cleverness
and
spirit
plus
a
strong
sense_of_taste
and
measure
save
a
wry
little
joke
from
becoming
either
bawdy
or
mawkish
.
The
simple
,
clever
production
was
also
able
to
tread
the
thin
line
between
those
extremes
.
Arlene_Saunders
was
charming
as
poor
Gontran
.
Yes
,
Arlene
is
her
name
;
the
work
uses
the
old
eighteenth-century
tradition
of
giving
the
part
of
a
young
inexperienced
youth
to
a
soprano
.
Benita_Valente
was
delightful
as
the
young
wife
and
John_Parella
was
amusing
as
the
tutor
who
failed
to
do
all
his
tutoring
.
The
work
was
presented
as
the
final
event
in
the
Town_Hall
Festival
of
Music
.
It
was
paired
with
a
Darius_Milhaud
opera
,
``
The
Poor_Sailor
''
,
set_to
a
libretto
by
Jean_Cocteau
,
a
kind_of
Grand_Guignol
by
the
sea
,
a
sailor
returns
,
unrecognized
,
and
gets
done_in
by
his
wife
.
With
the
exception
of
a_few
spots
,
Milhaud
's
music
mostly
churns
away
with
his
usual
collection
of
ditties
,
odd
harmonies
,
and
lumbering
,
satiric
orchestration
.
