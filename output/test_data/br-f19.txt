The
popularity
of
folklore
in
America
stands
in
direct
proportion
to
the
popularity
of
nationalism
in
America
.
And
the
emphasis
on
nationalism
in
America
is
in_proportion_to
the
growth
of
American
influence
across
the
world
.
Thus
,
if
we
are
to
observe
American
folklore
in
the
twentieth
century
,
we
will
do_well
to
establish
the
relationships
between
folklore
,
nationalism
and
imperialism
at
the
outset
.
Historians
have
come
to
recognize
two
cardinal
facts
concerning
nationalism
and
international
influence
.
1
)
Every
age
rewrites
the
events
of
its
history
in_terms_of
what
should
have
been
,
creating
legends
about
itself
that
rationalize
contemporary
beliefs
and
excuse
contemporary
actions
.
What
actually
occurred
in
the
past
is
seldom
as
important
as
what
a
given
generation
feels
must
have
occurred
.
2
)
As
a
country
superimposes
its
cultural
and
political
attitudes
on
others
,
it
searches
its
heritage
in
hopes
of
justifying
its
aggressiveness
.
Its
folklore
and
legend
,
usually
disguised
as
history
,
are
allowed
to
account_for
group_actions
,
to
provide
a
focal_point
for
group
loyalty
,
and
to
become
a
cohesive
force
for
national
identification
.
One
can
apply
these
facts
to
Britain
in
the
late
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
as
she
spread
her
dominion
over
palm
and
pine
,
and
they
can
be
applied
again
to
the
United_States
in
more
recent
years
.
The
popularity
of
local
color
literature
before
the
Spanish-American_War
,
the
steady
currency
of
the
Lincoln
myth
,
the
increased
emphasis
on
the
frontier
west
in
our
mass_media
are
cases_in_point
.
Nor
is
it
an
accident
that
baseball
,
growing
into
the
national
game
in
the
last
75
years
,
has
become
a
microcosm
of
American
life
,
that
learned
societies
such_as
the
American_Folklore_Society
and
the
American_Historical_Association
were
founded
in
the
1880's
,
or
that
courses
in
American
literature
,
American
civilization
,
American
anything
have
swept
our
school
and
college
curricula
.
Of_course
,
nationalism
has
really
outlived
its
usefulness
in
a
country
as
world
oriented
as
ours
,
and
its
continued
existence
reflects
one
of
the
major
culture
lags
of
the
twentieth
century
United_States
.
Yet
nationalism
has
lost
few
of
its
charms
for
the
historian
,
writer
or
man_in_the_street
.
It
is
an
understandable
paradox
that
most
American
history
and
most
American
literature
is
today
written
from
an
essentially
egocentric
and
isolationistic
point_of_view
at
the
very
time
America
is
spreading
her
dominion
over
palm
and
pine
.
After_all
,
the
average
American
as
he
lies
and
waits
for
the
enemy
in
Korea
or
as
she
scans
the
newspaper
in
some
vain
hope
of
personal
contact
with
the
front
is
unconcerned
that
his
or
her
plight
is
the
result
of
a
complex
of
personal
,
economic
and
governmental
actions
far
beyond
the
normal
citizen
's
comprehension
and
control
.
Anyone
's
identification
with
an
international
struggle
,
whether
warlike
or
peaceful
,
requires
absurd
oversimplification
and
intense
emotional
involvement
.
Such
identification
comes
for
each
group
in
each
crisis
by
rewriting
history
into
legend
and
developing
appropriate
national
heroes
.
In
America
,
such
self-deception
has
served
a
particularly
useful
purpose
.
A
heterogeneous
people
have
needed
it
to
attain
an
element
of
cultural
and
political
cohesion
in
a
new
and
ever_changing
land
.
But
we
must
never
forget
,
most_of
the
appropriate
heroes
and
their
legends
were
created
overnight
,
to
answer
immediate
needs
,
almost
always
with
conscious
aims
and
ends
.
Parson_Weems
's
George_Washington
became
the
symbol
of
honesty
and
the
father
image
of
the
uniting
States
.
Abraham_Lincoln
emerged
as
an
incarnation
of
the
national
Constitution
.
Robert_E._Lee
represented
the
dignity
needed
by
a
rebelling
confederacy
.
And
their
roles
are
paralleled
by
those
of
Patrick_Henry
,
Nathan_Hale
,
Andrew_Jackson
,
Davy_Crockett
,
Theodore_Roosevelt
and
many
,
many
more
.
Therefore
,
the
scholar
,
as
he
looks_at
our
national
folklore
of
the
last
60
years
,
will
be
mindful
of
two
facts
.
1
)
Most_of
the
legends
that
are
created
to
fan
the
fires
of
patriotism
are
essentially
propagandistic
and
are
not
folk
legends
at_all
.
2
)
The
concept
that
an
``
American
national
folklore
''
exists
is
itself
probably
another
propagandistic
legend
.
Folklore
is
individually
created
art
that
a
homogeneous
group
of
people
preserve
,
vary
and
recreate
through
oral
transmission
.
It
has
come
to
mean
myths
,
legends
,
tales
,
songs
,
proverbs
,
riddles
,
superstitions
,
rhymes
and
such
literary
forms
of
expression
.
Related
to
written
literature
,
and
often
remaining
temporarily
frozen
in
written
form
,
it
loses
its
vitality
when
transcribed
or
removed
from
its
oral
existence
.
Though
it
may
exist
in
either
literate
or
illiterate
societies
,
it
assumes
a
role
of
true
cultural
importance
only
in
the
latter
.
In
its
propagandistic
and
commercial
haste
to
discover
our
folk
heritage
,
the
public
has
remained
ignorant
of
definitions
such
as
this
.
Enthusiastically
,
Americans
have
swept
subliterary
and
bogus
materials
like
Paul_Bunyan
tales
,
Abe_Lincoln
anecdotes
and
labor_union
songs
up
as
true
products
of
our
American
oral
tradition
.
Nor
have
we
remembered
that
in
the
melting_pot
of
America
the
hundreds
of
isolated
and
semi
isolated
ethnic
,
regional
and
occupational
groups
did
not
fuse
into
a
homogeneous
national
unit
until
long
after
education
and
industrialization
had
caused
them
to
cast
oral
tradition
aside
as
a
means
of
carrying
culturally
significant
material
.
Naturally
,
such
scholarly
facts
are
of
little
concern
to
the
man
trying
to
make
money
or
fan
patriotism
by
means
of
folklore
.
That
much
of
what
he
calls
folklore
is
the
result
of
beliefs
carefully
sown
among
the
people
with
the
conscious
aim
of
producing
a
desired
mass
emotional
reaction
to
a
particular
situation
or
set
of
situations
is
irrelevant
.
As_long_as
his
material
is
Americana
,
can
in_some_way
be
ascribed
to
the
masses
and
appears
``
democratic
''
to
his
audience
,
he
remains
satisfied
.
From
all
this
we
can
now
see
that
two
streams
of
development
run
through
the
history
of
twentieth
century
American
folklore
.
On
the
one
side
we
have
the
university
professors
and
their
students
,
trained
in
Teutonic
methods
of
research
,
who
have
sought_out
,
collected
and
studied
the
true
products
of
the
oral
traditions
of
the
ethnic
,
regional
and
occupational
groups
that
make_up
this
nation
.
On
the
other
we
have
the
flag_wavers
and
the
national
sentimentalists
who
have
been
willing
to
use
any
patriotic
,
``
frontier
western
''
or
colonial
material
willy-nilly
.
Unfortunately
,
few
of
the
artists
(
writers
,
movie
producers
,
dramatists
and
musicians
)
who
have
used
American
folklore
since
1900
have
known
enough
to
distinguish
between
the
two
streams
even
in
the
most
general
of
ways
.
After_all
,
the
field
is
large
,
difficult
to
define
and
seldom
taught
properly
to
American
undergraduates
.
In_addition
,
this
country
has
been
settled
by
many
peoples
of
many
heritages
and
their
lore
has
become
acculturated
slowly
,
in
an
age
of
print
and
easy
communication
,
within
an
ever
expanding
and
changing
society
.
The
problems
confuse
even
the
experts
.
For_that_matter
,
the
experts
themselves
are
a
mixed
breed
.
Anthropologists
,
housewives
,
historians
and
such
by
profession
,
they
approach
their
discipline
as
amateurs
,
collectors
,
commercial
propagandists
,
analysts
or
some
combination
of
the
four
.
They
have
widely
varying
backgrounds
and
aims
.
They
have
little
``
esprit_de_corps
''
.
The
outlook
for
the
amateur
,
for_instance
,
is
usually
dependent_on
his
fondness
for
local
history
or
for
the
picturesque
.
His
love
of
folklore
has
romanticism
in
it
,
and
he
does
n't
care
much
about
the
dollar_sign
or
the
footnote
.
Folklore
is
his
hobby
,
and
he
,
all_too
rightly
,
wishes
it
to
remain
as
such
.
The
amateur
is
closely
related
to
the
collector
,
who
is
actually
no
more_than
the
amateur
who
has
taken_to
the
field
.
The
collector
enjoys
the
contact
with
rural
life
;
he
hunts
folklore
for
the
very
``
field
and
stream
''
reasons
that
many
persons
hunt
game
;
and
only
rarely
is
he
acutely
concerned
with
the
meaning
of
what
he
has
located
.
Fundamentally
,
both
these
types
,
the
amateur
and
the
collector
,
are
uncritical
and
many
of
them
do
n't
distinguish
well
between
real
folklore
and
bogus
material
.
But
there
are
also
the
commercial
propagandists
and
the
analysts
-
one
dominated_by
money
,
the
other
by
nineteenth
century
German
scholarship
.
Both
are
primarily
concerned
with
the
uses
that
can
be
made
of
the
material
that
the
collector
has
found
.
Both
shudder
at
the
thought
of
proceeding
too
far
beyond
the
sewage_system
and
the
electric
light
lines
.
The
commercial
propagandist
,
who
can
n't
afford
to
be
critical
,
gets_along
well
with
the
amateur
,
from
whom
he
feeds
,
but
he
frequently
steps
on
the
analyst
's
toes
by
refusing
to
keep
his
material
genuine
.
His
standards
are
,
of_course
,
completely
foreign
to
those
of
the
analyst
.
To
both
the
amateur
and
the
commercial
progandist
the
analyst
lacks
a
soul
,
lacks
appreciation
with
his
endless
probings
and
classifications
.
Dominated_by
the
vicious_circle
of
the
university
promotion_system
,
the
analyst
looks_down_on
and
gets_along
poorly
with
the
other
three
groups
,
although
he
cannot
deny
his
debt
to
the
collector
.
The
knowledge
that
most
Americans
have
of
folklore
comes
through
contact
with
commercial
propagandists
and
a_few
energetic
amateurs
and
collectors
.
The
work
done
by
the
analysts
,
the
men
who
really
know
what
folklore
is
all
about
,
has
no_more
appeal
than
any
other
work
of
a
truly
scientific
sort
and
reaches
a
limited
,
learned
audience
.
Publishers
want
books
that
will
sell
,
recording_studios
want
discs
that
will
not
seem
strange
to
ears
used_to
hillbilly
and
jazz
music
,
grade
and
high_schools
want
quaint
,
but
moral
,
material
.
The
analyst
is
apt
to
be
too
honest
to
fit_in
.
As
a
result
,
most
people
do
n't
have
more
than
a
vague
idea
what
folklore
actually
is
;
they
see
it
as
a
potpourri
of
charming
,
moral
legends
and
patriotic
anecdotes
,
with
a
superstition
or
remedy
thrown_in
here_and_there
.
And
so
well
is
such
ignorance
preserved
by
the
amateur
and
the
money-maker
that
even
at
the
college_level
most_of
the
hundred
odd
folklore
courses
given
in
the
United_States
survive
on
sentiment
and
nationalism
alone
.
If
one
wishes
to
discuss
a
literary
figure
who
uses
folklore
in
his
work
,
the
first
thing
he
must
realize
is
that
the
literary
figure
is
probably
part
of
this
ignorant
American
public
.
And
while
every
writer
must
be
dealt
with
as
a
special
case
,
the
interested
student
will
want
to
ask
himself
a
number
of
questions
about
each
.
Does
the
writer
know
the
difference
between
an
``
ersatz
''
ballad
or
tall_tale
and
a
true
product
of
the
folk
?
When
the
writer
uses
material
does
he
tamper
with
it
to
improve
its
commercial
effect
or
does
he
leave
it
pure
?
Is
the
writer
propagandistic
?
Is
he
swept_away
by
sentiment
and
nostalgia
for
an
America
that
was
?
Or
does
he
sincerely
want
to
tap
the
real
springs
of
American
attitude
and
culture
regardless
of
how
unpopular
and
embarrassing
they
may
be
?
When
he
gets
the
answers
to
his
questions
he
will
be
discouraged
.
In_the_first_place
,
a
good
many
writers
who
are
said
to
use
folklore
,
do
not
,
unless
one
counts
an
occasional
superstition
or
tale
.
Robert_Frost
,
for_instance
,
writes
about
rural
life
in
New_England
,
but
he
does
not
include
any
significant
amount
of
folklore
in
his
poems
.
This
has
not
,
however
,
prevented
publishers
from
labeling
him
a
``
folk_poet
''
,
simply
because
he
is
a
rural
one
.
In
the
second
place
,
a
large_number
of
writers
,
making
a
more
direct
claim
than
Frost
to
being
``
folk_writers
''
of
one
sort
or
another
,
clearly
make
no
distinctions
between
genuine
and
bogus
material
.
Stephen_Vincent_Benet
's
John_Brown's_Body
comes
immediately
to
mind
in
this
connection
,
as
does
John_Steinbeck
's
The_Grapes_of_Wrath
and
Carl_Sandburg
's
The_People,_Yes
.
The
last
two
writers
introduce
strong
political
bias
into
their
works
,
and
not
unlike
the
union
leaders
that
we
will
discuss
soon
,
see
folklore
as
a
reservoir
of
protest
by
a
downtrodden
and
publically
silenced
mass
.
Folklore
,
as
used
by
such
writers
,
really
reflects
images
engraved
into
it
by
the
very
person
using
it
.
The
folk
are
simply
not
homogeneous
with_respect_to
nation
or
political
attitude
.
In_fact
,
there
is
much
evidence
to
indicate
they
do
n't
care
a_bit
about
anything
beyond
their
particular
regional
,
ethnic
and
occupational
limits
.
Nevertheless
,
with
a
reading
public
that
longs
for
``
the_good_old_days
''
and
with
an
awareness
of
our
expanding
international
interests
,
it
is
easy
for
the
Benets
to
obtain
a
magnified
position
in
literature
by
use
of
all
sorts
of
Americana
,
real
or
fake
,
and
it
is
easy
for
the
Steinbecks
and
Sandburgs
to
support
their
messages
of
reform
by
reading
messages
of
reform
into
the
minds
of
the
folk
.
