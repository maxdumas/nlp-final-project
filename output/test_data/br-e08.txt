Scientists
say
that
the
world
and
everything
in
it
are
based
on
mathematics
.
Without
math
the
men
who
are
continually
seeking
the
causes
of
and
the
reasons
for
the
many
things
that
make
the
world
go
'
round
would
not
have
any
means
of
analyzing
,
standardizing
,
and
communicating
the
things
they
discover
and
learn
.
Math
and
the
formulas
that
allow
it
to
be
applied
to
different
problems
are
,
therefore
,
essential
to
any
scientific
endeavor
.
Hot
rodding
is
a
science
.
It
's
not
a
science
as
involved
as
determining
what
makes
the
earth
rotate
on
its
axis
or
building
a
rocket
or
putting
a
satellite
into
orbit
but
it
is
,
nevertheless
,
a
science
.
But
because
science
is
based
on
mathematics
does
n't
mean
that
a
hot
rodder
must
necessarily
be
a
mathematician
.
A
guy
can
be
an
active
and
successful
hot
rodder
for
years
without
becoming
even
remotely
involved_with
mathematical
problems
;
however
,
he
will
have
a
clearer
understanding
of_what
he
is
doing
and
the
chances
are
he
will
be
more
successful
if
he
understands
the
few
formulas
that
apply
to
rodding
.
A
mathematical
formula
is
nothing
more_than
a
pattern
for
solving
a
specific
problem
.
It
places
the
various
factors
involved
in
the
problem
in
their
correct
order
in_relation_to
each
other
so_that
the
influence
of
factors
on
each
other
can
be
computed
.
The
first_step
in
using
a
formula
is
to
insert
the
numerical_values
of
the
factors
involved
in
their
correct
positions
in
the
formula
.
This
changes
the
formula
to
an
``
equation
''
.
The
equation
is
used
for
the
mathematical_process
of
solving
the
problem
.
Equations
for
rodding
formulas
are
not
complicated
.
They
involve
only
simple
mathematics
that
are
taught
in
grammar_school
arithmetic
classes
.
However
,
it
is
essential
that
the
various
mathematical_symbols
used
in
the
equations
be_understood
so_that
the
mathematical_processes
can
be
done
properly
and
in
their
correct
order
.
They
indicate
simple
division
,
multiplication
,
subtraction
,
and
addition
.
The
symbol
for
division
is
a
straight_line
that
separates
two
numbers
placed
one
above
the
other
.
The
lower
number
is
always
divided
into
the
upper
number
:
*
*
f
The
symbol
for
multiplication
is
``
''
.
It
is
used
to
separate
two
or
more
numbers
in
a
row
.
For_example
:
*
*
f_Numbers
to
be
multiplied
together
may
be
multiplied
in
any
order
.
The
result
will
be
the
same
regardless_of
the
order
used
.
The
symbol
for
subtraction
is
the
standard
minus_sign
.
This
is
nothing
more_than
a
dash
.
It
separates
two
or
more
numbers
.
The
number
on_the_right
of
the
symbol
is
always
subtracted
from
the
number
on_the_left
of
the
symbol
.
For_example
:
*
*
f
When
more_than
two
figures
are
separated
by
subtraction
symbols
the
subtraction
must
be
carried_out
from
the
left
to
right
if
the
result
is
to
be
correct
.
For_example
,
for
the
problem
*
*
f
,
10
from
25
equals
15
,
then
6
from
15
equals
9
.
Addition
is
indicated
by
the
+
symbol
.
The
symbol
is
used
to
separate
two
or
more
numbers
.
For_example
:
*
*
f_Numbers
separated
by
addition
symbols
may
be
placed
in
any
order
.
When
solving
an
equation
that
involves
division
as_well
as
other
steps
,
do
all
the
division
steps
first
to
reduce
those
parts
of
the
equation
to
their
numerical_value
.
Multiplication
,
subtraction
,
and
addition
can
then
be
accomplished
as
they
appear
in
the
equation
by
starting
at
the
left
end
of
the
equation
and
working
toward_the_right
.
Completing
the
division
first
also
includes
those
division
parts
that
require
multiplication
,
subtraction
,
or
addition
steps
:
*
*
f
This
would
be
reduced
by
multiplying
8
times
6
and_then
dividing
the
product
by
12
.
This
part
of
the
equation
would
then
become
4
.
For
use
in
formulas
,
fractions
should
be
converted
to
their
decimal
equivalents
.
The
easiest
way
to
do
this
is
with
a
conversion
chart
.
Charts
for
this
purpose
are
available
from
many
sources
.
They
are
included
in
all
types
of
mathematical
handbooks
and
they
are
stamped
on
some
types
of
precision
measuring_instruments
.
The
various
mathematical_processes
can
be
simplified
by
carrying
the
results
to
only
two
or
three
decimal
places
.
Shortening
the
results
in
this
manner
will
not
have
any
detrimental
effect
on
the
accuracy
of
the
final
result
.
Some
formulas
contain
``
constants
''
.
A
constant
is
a
number
that
remains
the
same
regardless_of
the
other
numbers
used
in
the
formula
and
the
resultant
equation
.
It
is
a
number
without
which
the
equation
cannot
be
solved
correctly
.
Rodding
formulas
apply
to
many
phases
of
the
sport
.
The
answers
they
give
can
often
pave_the_way
to
performance
increases
and
,
quite
often
,
are
necessary
for
completing
entry
blanks
for
different
events
.
When
it
is
needed
,
one
formula
is
as
important
as
another
.
However
,
some
formulas
are
used
more_than
others
.
We
'll
take
them
in
the
general
order
of
their
popularity
.
A
rodder
should
be
able
to
compute
the
displacement
of
his
engine
.
Displacement
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
``
swept
volume
''
.
Most
entry
blanks
for
competitive
events
require
engine
displacement
information
because
of
class
restrictions
.
It
is
good
to
be
able
to
compute
displacement
so_that
changes
in
it
resulting
from
boring
and
stroking
can
be
computed
.
Factors
involved
in
the
displacement
formula
are
the
bore
diameter
of
the
engine
's
cylinders
,
the
length
of
the
piston
stroke
,
the
number
of
cylinders
in
the
engine
,
and
a
constant
.
The
constant
is
.7854
,
which
is
one-quarter
of
3.1416
,
another
constant
known_as
``
pi
''
.
Pi
is
used
in
formulas
concerned
with
the
dimensions
of
circles
.
Actually
,
the
engine
displacement
formula
is
the
standard
formula
for
computing
the
volume
of
a
cylinder
of
any
type
with
an
added
factor
that
represents
the
number
of
cylinders
in
the
engine
.
The
cross-sectional
area
of
the
cylinders
is
determined
and_then
the
volume
of
the
individual
cylinders
is
computed
by
multiplying
the
area
by
the
stroke
length
,
which
is
the
equivalent
of
the
length
of
the
cylinders
.
Multiplying
the
result
by
the
number
of
cylinders
in
the
engine
gives
the
engine
's
total
displacement
.
The
formula
is
:
*
*
f
.
Dimensions
in
inches
,
and
fractions
of
inches
will
give
the
displacement
in
cubic_inches
.
Dimensions
in
centimeters
and
fractions
of
centimeters
will
give
the
displacement
in
cubic_centimeters
(
cc
)
.
One
inch
equals
2.54
centimeters
:
one
cubic_inch
equals
16.38
cubic_centimeters
.
For_example
,
let
's
consider
a
standard
283
cubic_inch
Chevy_V8
.
These
engines
have
a
cylinder
diameter
of
3
-
7
8
inches
and
a
stroke
length
of
3
inches
.
The
formula
,
with
the
fractions
converted
to
decimals
,
becomes
*
*
f
.
To
arrive_at
the
answer
,
multiply
the
numbers
together
by
starting
at
the
left
of
the
group
and
working
to
the
right
.
The
different
steps
will
look_like
this
*
*
f
.
A
cylinder
's
compression
ratio
is
computed
by
comparing
the
cylinder
's
volume
,
or
its
displacement
,
with
the
total
volume
of
the
cylinder
and
its
combustion
chamber
.
Cylinder
volume
can
be
determined
mathematically
but
combustion
chamber
volume
must
be
measured
with
a
liquid
.
Cylinder
volume
is
determined
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
for
the
displacement
formula
:
*
*
f
.
To
measure
the
volume
of
one
of
the
combustion
chambers
in
the
cylinder_head
,
install
the
valves
and
spark_plug
in
the
chamber
and
support
the
head
so_that
its
gasket
surface
is
level
.
Then
pour
water
or
light
oil
from
a
graduated
beaker
into
the
chamber
to
fill
the
chamber
to
its
gasket
surface
.
Do
not
overfill
the
chamber
.
This
is
possible
with
water
and
other
liquids
that
have
a
high
surface_tension
.
Such
liquids
will
rise
to
a
considerable
height
above
the
surface
around
the
chamber
before
they
will
flow_out
of
the
chamber
.
The
amount
of
liquid
poured
into
the
chamber
is
determined
by
subtracting
the
quantity
still
in
the
beaker
when
the
chamber
is
full
from
the
original
quantity
.
Most
beakers
are
graduated
in
cubic_centimeters
(
cc
)
,
making
it
necessary
to
convert
the
result
to
cubic_inches
.
However
,
the
displacement
of
the
cylinder
can
be
converted
to
cubic_centimeters
.
The
compression
ratio
arrived_at
with
the
formula
will
be
the
same
regardless_of
whether
cubic_inches
or
cubic_centimeters
are
used
.
The
only
precaution
is
that
all
volumes
used
in
the
formula
be
quoted
in
the
same
terms
.
The
volume
of
the
cylinder
opening
in_the_head
gasket
must
be
computed
by
multiplying
its
area
in
square_inches
by
the
gasket
's
thickness
in
thousandths
of
an
inch
.
Sometimes
it
is
necessary
to
roughly
calculate
the
square_inch
area
of
the
opening
but
the
calculation
can
usually
be
made
with
sufficient
accuracy
that
it
won
n't
affect
the
final
computation
.
The
volume
of
the
opening
is_added
to
the
combustion
chamber
volume
.
Another
thing
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
is
the
volume
of
the
area
between
the
top
of
the
piston
and
the
top
of
the
cylinder_block
when
the
piston
is
in
top
dead
center
position
.
Compute
this
volume
by
measuring
the
distance
from
the
top
of
the
block
to
the
piston
head
as
accurately
as
possible
with
a
depth
micrometer
or
some
other
precision
measuring
device
and_then
multiply
the
area
of
the
cylinder
by
the
depth
.
The
formula
for
this
step
is
:
*
*
f
This
volume
is_added
to
the
total
volume
of
the
combustion
chamber
and
head_gasket
opening
.
The
total
of
these
three
volumes
is
the
``
final
combustion
chamber
volume
''
.
After
the
factors
just
described
have
been
computed
,
they
are
applied_to
the
following
formula
:
*
*
f
For
an
example
let
's
dream_up
an
engine
that
has
a
final
combustion
chamber
volume
of
5
cubic_inches
and
a
cylinder
volume
of
45
cubic_inches
.
Applying
these
figures
to
the
formula
we
get
the
equation
:
*
*
f
The
compression
ratio
is
10
to
1
.
This
method
of
computing
compression
ratio
cannot
be
used
accurately
for
engines
that
have
pistons
with
either
domed
or
irregularly
shaped
heads
.
Any
irregularity
on
the
piston
heads
will
make
it
impossible
,
with
normal
means
,
to
determine
the
final
combustion
chamber
volume
because
the
volume
displaced
by
the
piston
heads
cannot
be
readily
computed
.
The
only
way
to
determine
the
final
combustion
chamber
volume
when
such
pistons
are
used
is
by
measuring
it
with
liquid
while
the
cylinder_head
is
bolted
to
the
cylinder_block
and
the
piston
is
in
top
dead
center
position
.
There
are
four
versions
of
the
formula
that
involves
the
relationships
of
car
speed
,
engine
speed
,
rear
axle
gear
ratio
,
and
rear
tire
size
.
By
using
the
appropriate
version
any
one
of
these
factors
can
be
determined
for
any
combination
of
the
other
three
.
To
simplify
the
formulas
a
representative
symbol
is
substituted
for
each
of
the
factors
.
These
are
MPH
for
Car
speed
RPM
for
Engine
crankshaft
speed
R
for
Rear
axle
gear
ratio
W
for
Tire
size
Tire
size
can
be
determined
in
several
ways
but
the
one
that
is
the
easiest
and
as
accurate
as
any
is
by
measuring
the
effective
radius
of
a
wheel
and
tire
assembly
.
This
is
done
by
measuring
the
distance
from
the
surface
on_which
the
tire
is
resting
to
the
center
of
the
rear
axle
shaft
.
A
tire
must
be
inflated
to
its
normal
hot
operating
pressure
and
the
car
must
be
loaded
to
its
operating
weight
when
this
measurement
is
made
.
The
measurement
must
be
in
inches
.
Any
fraction
of
an
inch
involved
in
the
measurement
must
be
converted
to
a
decimal
equivalent_to
simplify
the
mathematics
.
When
tire
size
is
measured
in_this
manner
a
constant
of
168
is
used
in
the
formula
.
To
determine
car
speed
for
a
given
combination
of
engine
speed
,
gear
ratio
,
and
tire
size
,
the
formula
is
:
*
*
f
For
an
engine
speed
of
5000
rpm
,
a
gear
ratio
of
4.00
to
1
,
and
a
tire
radius
of
13
inches
,
the
equation
would
look_like
this
:
*
*
f
To
determine
engine
speed
for
a
given
combination
of
the
other
three
factors
the
formula
is
:
*
*
f
Using
the
same
figures
as
for
the
previous
example
,
the
equation
becomes
:
*
*
