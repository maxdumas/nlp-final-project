It
is
a
good
eight
years
now
since
each
of
us
acquired
a
swimming_pool
-
eight
enlightening
,
vigorous
,
rigorous
,
not
wholly
unrewarding
years
.
We
have
learned
a_lot
-
a
dash
of
hydrochemistry
here
,
a_bit
about
plumbing
and
pump-priming
there
.
We
have
had
sound
grounding
in
the
principles
of
the
mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove
school
of
diplomacy
.
We
have
become
amateur
insurance
experts
and
fine-feathered
yard
birds
.
True
,
our
problems
have
lessened
a_bit
as
more_and_more
of
our
neighbors
have
built
their
own
pools
,
thereby
diluting
our
spectacular
attractions
.
But
problems
cling_to
pools
,
as
any
pool
owner
knows
.
So
our
innate
generosity
of
spirit
prompts
us
to
share
our
trials
,
errors
and
solutions
with
any
who
are
taking
the
pool
plunge
for_the_first_time
-
in
the
pious
hope
that
some
may
profit
from
our
experience
.
Position
may
not
be
everything
,
but
in
the
case
of
a
pool
it
can
certainly
contribute
difficulties
,
social
and
/
or
physical
.
We
speak
from
varying
viewpoints
.
One
of
us
has
a
pool
set
in
a
wooded
area
very
near
the
house
.
The
other
has
his
pool
far
away
from
the
house
in
a
field
high
on
a
hill
.
If
you
are
dreaming
of
a
blue
,
shimmering
pool
right
outside
your
living_room
windows
,
close
your
eyes
firmly
and
fill_in
the
picture
with
lots
and
lots_of
children
,
damp
towels
,
squashed
tubes
of
suntan
oil
and
semi-inflated
plastic
toys
.
You
are
likely
to
be
nearer
the
truth
.
You
can
also
see
that
the
greater
the
proximity
of
the
pool
to
your
main
living_quarters
,
the
greater
the
chance
for
violation
of
family
privacy
,
annoying
noise
and
the
let
's
-
make-your-house-our-club
attitude
.
On_the_other_hand
,
out-of-sight
does
not
lead
to
out-of-mind
when
children
cannot
be
easily
observed
and
you
have_to
make
a
long
trek
to
reach
the
pool
.
Another
dilemma
:
As
picturesque
as
a
sylvan
pond
in
the
forest
may
be
,
trees
offer
a
leaf
and
root
hazard
to
the
well-being
of
a
pool
.
Yet
a
grassy
approach
can
turn
a
pool
into
a
floating
lawn
every
time
the
grass
is
mowed
.
As
in
choosing
a
wife
,
it
is
only
sensible
to
consider
also
how
appealing
a
pool
is_likely
to
be
in
bad_weather
as_well
as
in
good
.
In
the
colder
climes
,
for_instance
,
you
will
have_to
live
through
the
many
unglamorous
winter
months
when
your
pool
will
hardly
look
its
best
.
It
may
be
a
big
hole_in_the_ground
filled
with
salt
hay
,
or
an
ice_floe
studded
with
logs
.
Even
a
neat
,
plastic-covered
plunge
is
not
exactly
a
joy
to
behold
.
(
We
do
,
however
,
recommend
those
patented
covers
to
prevent
both
people
and
junk
-
flora
and
fauna
generally
-
from
accidentally
wintering
in
the
pool
.
)
Probably
no
location
for
a
pool
is
perfect
on
all
counts
.
Naturally
it
will
be
dictated
to
a
large
extent
by
the
shape
and
size
of
your
land
.
But
if
space
and
money
are
no
problem
and
small
children
are
not
on_hand
every_day
,
it
is
certainly
more
restful
to
have
your
pool
and
entertainment
area
removed
from
the
immediate
environs
of
the
house
.
And
a
good
several
feet
around
the
pool
should
be
neither
greensward
nor
woods
,
but
good
hard
pavement
.
The
placement
of
your
pool
,
however
,
will
not
of
itself
solve
the
two
major
problems
of
pool
owning
-
those
that
involve
your
social
life
and
those
pertaining
to
safety
.
Coping_with
them
demands
stern
discipline
-
of
yourself
as_well
as
of
your
family
,
neighbors
,
friends
and
anyone
you
ever
talked
to
on
a
transoceanic
jet
.
Eight
years
ago
while
we
were
going_through
the
mud-sweat-and-tears
construction
period
,
we
were
each
solaced
by
the
vision
of
early
morning
dips
and
evening
home-comings
to
a
cool
family
collected
around
the
pool
with
a
buffet
table
laid_out
nearby
for
the
lord
and
master
's
delectation
.
But
not
even
our
first
pool-side
gatherings
came
anywhere
near
those
rosy
fantasies
.
We
seemed
to
be
witnessing
the
population
explosion
right
in
our
own
backyards
.
Our
respective
families
looked
as
if
they
had
quadrupled
.
Had
we
taken
a
lien
on
a
state
park
?
Not_at_all
.
We
had
merely
been
discovered
by
the
pool
sharks
.
We
were
in
business
!
From
proud
pool-owners
to
perpetual
hosts
and
handymen
was
a
short
step
-
no_more_than
the
change
from
city
clothes
to
trunks
.
Nai
^
ve
of
us
,
maybe
,
but
the
results
of
our
impulsive
invitations
to
``
come
over
next
summer
and
swim
in
our
new
pool
''
were
both
unexpected
and
unsettling
.
After
the
first
few
weeks
,
it
was
obvious
that
rules
had_to
be
made
,
laid_down
and
obeyed
-
even
if
our
popularity
ratings
became
subnormal
as
a
result
.
So
rules
we
made
,
in
unabashed
collusion
.
Since
our
viewpoints
in_this
respect
coincided
precisely
,
we
present
the
fruits
of
our
efforts
herewith
as
a
single
social
code
for
pool
owners
.
First_and_foremost
:
No
one
-
no
,
not
anyone
-
in
the
family
is
allowed
to
issue
blanket
invitations
to
his
or
her
own
circle
.
Just
short
of
forty
lashes
we
finally
managed
to
coerce
our
children
to
this
view
.
Their
friends
and
ours
are
welcome
to
share
the
pool
,
but
on
our
terms
and
at
our
times
.
No
friends
are
to
arrive
without
an
invitation
or
without
at_least
telephoning
beforehand
.
No
ringers
,
either
-
even
if
they
are
trailing
legitimate
invitees
.
We
want_to
know
when
the
Potlatches
telephone
exactly
how
many
they
are
planning
to
bring
,
so_that
we
won
n't
end_up
with
a
splashing
mob
that
looks_like
Coney_Island
in
August
.
No
young
children
may
come
without
adults
except
for
a
specific
,
organized
,
chaperoned
party
.
And
accompanying
adults
are
urged
to
keep
an
alert
and
sensible
eye
on
their
responsibilities
.
A
gaggle
of
gabbling
mothers
,
backs
to
the
pool
,
is
no
safeguard
.
No
bottle
pool
is
tolerated
-
bottle
pool
being
our
lingo
for
those
who
come
to
swim
and
sink
into
our
bar
while
protesting
that
they
can
only
dunk
and
run
.
(
Sanity
,
solvency
and
relations
with
our
wine_merchant
took
a
beating
that
first
summer
as
we
inadvertently
became
the
neighborhood
free-drink
stop
.
)
We
designated
one_day
a
week
as
the
time
when
neighborhood
teen-agers
might
swim
at
definite
hours
.
This
has
saved
us
from
constant
requests
seven
days
a
week
and
made
us
feel
less
brutal
to
the
young
``
less
fortunate
''
than
ours
.
We
also
worked_out
logistics
for
Sunday
afternoon
swimmers
who
arrive
two
hours
early
with
their
weekend
guests
while
we
are
still
enjoying
an
alfresco
lunch
en_famille
.
We
gently
usher
them
to
an
island
of
tables
and
chairs
strategically
placed
on_the_far_side
of
the
pool
where
they
can
amuse
each
other
until
we
get
ready
to
merge
sides
.
All
dressing
(
undressing
to
be
more
exact
)
must
be
done
in
our
small
bath
house
or
at
the
swimmers
'
homes
.
(
To
avoid
any
possible
excuse
for
a
dripping
parade
through
your
house
,
it
is
a
good
idea
to
have
a
telephone_extension
near
the
pool
as_well
as
a
direct
outdoor
route
between
the
pool
and
the
parking_area
.
)
We
do
,
however
,
provide
a
limited
number
of
extra
suits
,
mainly
for
children
,
and
we
stock
extra
towels
and
a_few
inexpensive
bathing
conveniences
.
Life-preservers
,
the
buckle-on
kapok-filled
kind
,
are
held
in
readiness
,
too
,
for
the
very
young
.
Safety
rules
,
of_course
,
are
more
important
than
all
the
others
put_together
.
In
many
localities
,
now
,
the
law
requires
all
pools
to
be
fenced
,
usually
to
a
minimum
height
of
5
feet
.
But
fenced
or
unfenced
,
no
pool-side
is
the
place
for
running
or
horseplay
.
We
allow
no
underwater
endurance_contests
,
either
,
or
inexpert
versions
of
water_polo
.
Diving_boards
must
have
non-skid
surfaces
(
coco
matting
takes
an
awful
beating
from
chlorine
and
rots
quickly
,
but
grit-impregnated
paints
are
excellent
)
.
And
divers
must
be
enjoined
to
look
before
they
leap
,
either
on
top
of
someone
else
or
onto
a
pool
edge
.
Our
pools
also
have
wide
,
shallow
steps
-
for
the
benefit
of
the
littlest
swimmers
who
can
thus
be
introduced
to
the
water
with
far
greater
safety
than
a
ladder
affords
.
All
bottles
must
be
kept
a
safe
distance
away
from
the
pool
and
drinking_glasses
are
banned
in
favor
of
plastic
or
metal
cups
.
When
you
first
acquire
a
pool
,
we
earnestly
recommend
-
for
your
own
mental_health
-
a
good
long
chat
with
your
insurance_agent
.
You
should
be
prepared
to
cope_with
any
pitfall
such_as
plunges
into
empty
pools
or
shallow
ends
and
all
manner
of
winter
as_well
as
summer
lawsuits
.
Soignee
pools
,
alas
,
do
not
just
happen
.
They
are
the
result
of
a
constant
and
careful
contest
with
the
elements
.
Unless
you
want_to
make
your
wife
a
pool
widow
and
to
spend
a
great
many_of
your
leisure
hours
nursing
your
pool
's
pristine
purity
,
its
care
and
feeding
-
from
pH
content
to
filtering
and
vacuuming
-
is
best
left
to
a
weekly
or
bi-monthly
professional
service
.
Of_course
,
if
your
pool
is
close_to
the
house
,
your
wife
can
always
add
it
to
her
housekeeping
chores
(
you
hope
)
.
Or
you
can
make
pool
care
the
price
of
swimming
for
teen-agers
.
Even_so
,
every
pool
owner
,
in_case
of
emergency
,
should
have
some
idea
of_what
makes
things
work
.
A
brief
course
in
hydraulics
from
the
pool
builders
may
well
be
appreciated
in
a
future
crisis
.
A
sudden
high
rise
in
temperature
will
turn
your
pool
poison
green
overnight
.
You
need
more
chlorine
.
The
walls
feel
slippery
.
You
need
algaecide
.
With
or
without
professional
help
,
you
will
have_to
be
able
to
do
some
of
these
jobs
yourself
unless
you
have
a
full-time
pool
nurse
.
You
should
see_to_it
that
the
trap
,
the
dirt-catcher
in_front
of
the
filter
,
is
always
clean
.
A
pool
is
no
place
for
a
shut
trap
.
You
should
firmly
insist
that
no
bobby_pins
or
hair
pins
be
worn
in
the
water
.
When
shed
,
they
leave
rust
marks
.
You
can
hope
against
hope
that
come
spring_cleaning
,
your
fair-weather
friends
will
lend
a
hand
at
scrubbing
and
furbishing
.
It
has
happened
.
Many
hours
of
spring_cleaning
will
be
saved
,
however
,
if
you
remove
the
main
drain
grate
when
you
close
the
pool
season
in
the
fall
.
As
the
pool
is
emptied
,
stand_by
to
brush
down
the
walls
and
bottom
while
they
are
still
wet
.
Much
of
the
dirt
and
leaf
stain
is
easily
removed
when
damp
,
but
requires
dynamite
if
allowed
to
dry
.
If
you
have
a
6
-
to
8
-
inch
drain
pipe
,
you
may
easily
wash_out
all
the
debris
when
the
grate
is
out
.
Of_course
,
when
your
6
-
inch
torrent
of
water
is
released
,
it
may
cause
a_lot_of
comment
as
it
passes_through
or
by
neighboring
properties
.
Do
not
forget
this
possibility
.
If
your
pool
is
located
on
or
near
sloping
ground
,
it
may
have
natural
drainage
which
is
certainly
more
desirable
than
to
be
faced
with
the
annual
expense
and
labor
of
first
pumping
out
the
water
and_then
scooping_out
all
the
debris
.
It
may
be
true
that
pool
lighting
dramatizes
an
evening
scene
,
but
lights
also
attract
all
the
insect
life
for
miles
around
.
Once
on
the
water
,
these
little
visitors
seldom
leave
,
and
this
adds
to
your
filtering
and
vacuuming
problems
as_well
as
providing
a
slapping
good
time
for
all
those
present
.
Often
one
floodlight
high
in
a
tree
will
provide
all
the
light
you
need
at
much
less
expense
.
Our
experience
has
taught
us
that
it
pays
to
buy
the
best
equipment
possible
,
from
pipes
to
brushes
.
Follow
pool-care
instructions
to_the_letter
,
and
be
sure
that
one
person
(
in
the
family
or
not
)
is
regularly
responsible_for
each
aspect
of
the
job
,
with
no
chance
for
claiming
,
``
It
was
n't
my
turn
''
.
Never
let
anyone
not
in
the
know
take
a
turn
at
the
valves
-
even
if
the
little
boys
do
want
to
play
space_ship
.
You
may
find
yourself
hitting
bottom
,
literally
,
as
you
discover
that
water
is
running_out
even
while
you
are
putting
it
in
.
