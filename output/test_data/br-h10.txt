Members
of
the
Medical_Illustration_Service
lectured
and
conducted
demonstrations
on
the
use
of
training
aids
to
military_personnel
and
various

In
support
of
the
emphasis
placed
by
the
Department_of_Defense
on
instruction
in
emergency
medical_care
,
the
Medical_Illustration_Service
developed

Officers
,
as_well
as
Office
of
Civil
and
Defense_Mobilization
,
the
American
Red_Cross
,
and
similar
interested
organizations
were
informed
from_time_to_time
as
training
aids
were
developed
.
Nine
veterinary
lantern_slide
teaching
sets
were
developed
and
distributed
,
and
lantern_slide
teaching
sets
on
21
pathology
subjects
were
added
to
the
loan
library
of
the

.
Six
fascicles
(
10000
copies
each
)
of
the
``
Atlas
of
Tumor_Pathology
''
were
completed
during
the
period
of_this
report
.
This
consists_of
25
individual
registries
,
two
of_which
were
added
during
fiscal_years
1959
-
1960
(
the
Registry
of
Forensic_Pathology
and
the
Testicular_Tumor_Registry
)
.
These
registries
are
sponsored
by
18
national
medical
,
dental
,
and
veterinary
societies
and
have
as
their
mission
the
assembling
of
selected
cases
of
interest
to
military
medicine
and
of
establishing
through
the
mechanism
of
follow-up
of
living
patients
the
natural_history
of
various
diseases
of
military-medical
importance
.
The
American_Registry
of
Pathology
operates
as
a
cooperative
enterprise
in
medical
research
and
education
between
the
Armed_Forces
Institute
of
Pathology
and
the
civilian
medical_profession
on
a
national
and
international
basis
,
under
such
conditions
as
may
be
agreed
upon
between
the
National_Research_Council
and
The
Surgeons_General
of
the
Army
,
Navy
,
and
Air_Force
.
The
staff
utilized
the
collected
material
in
these
registries
for
numerous
lectures
to
national
and
international
meetings
,
exhibits
,
and
published
studies
.
During
the
period
of_this
report
,
37470
new
cases
were
entered
into
the
various
registries
.
These
were
selected
carefully
and
included
not_only
detailed
clinical
information
but
adequate
pathology
of
value
for
research
and
educational
purposes
.
In_this
same
period
,
six
new
fascicles
of
the
Atlas
of
Tumor_Pathology
were
published
and
distributed
to
medical_centers
world-wide
.
There
were
54320
copies
of
fascicles
sold
and
642
copies
distributed
free
during
this
period
.
Forty-five
new
Clinico-pathologic
Conferences
were
prepared
,
bringing
the
total
to
61
available
for
loan
distribution
.
Nine
new
teaching
Clinico-pathologic_Conference
sets
were
prepared
,
which
makes
a
total
of
70
types
of
teaching
sets
for
loan
.
During
this
period
,
7827
teaching
sets
were
distributed
on
loan
.
The
Clinico-pathologic
Conferences
have
been
acknowledged
as
of
great
value
and
in
consequent
great
demand
by
the
small
isolated
military_hospitals
.
The
demand
for
teaching
sets
continues
unabated
since
they
provide
the
means
for
the
military
physicians
to
review
the
pathology
of
selected
disease
processes
or
organ
systems
for
review
of
basic
sciences
and
correlation
of
clinical
physiological
behavior
with
structural
changes
.
In
fiscal_year
1959
,
the
Medical_Museum
was
moved
to
Chase_Hall
,
a
temporary
building
on
Independence_Avenue
at
Ninth_Street
,
Southwest
,
and
continued
to
display
to
the
public
the
achievements
of
the
Armed_Forces
Medical
Services
.
During
the
period
of_this
report
,
63
panel
exhibits
depicting
the
latest
developments
in
medical
research
were
displayed
.
Of
the
375
exhibits
(
of
all
types
)
shown
,
161
were
new
or
refurbished
.
Of
the
885
specimens
newly
mounted
or
refurbished
,
254
were
prepared
for
other
agencies
.
Eighty-five
specimens
were
loaned
for
study
purposes
.
An
exhibit
,
``
Macropathology
-
An
Ancient
Art
,
A
new
Science
''
,
was
presented
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
American_Medical_Association
.
A
three-dimensional
exhibit
depicting
``
A
Century
of
Naval_Medicine
''
was
formally
presented
to
The
Director
by
George_S._Squibb
,
great-grandson
of
the
founder
of
E._R._Squibb
and
Sons
,
for
permanent
display
in
the
Museum
.
Space
was
provided
for
short-time
guest
medical
exhibits
,
and
the
Museum
collected
new
accessions
of
microscopes
,
medical
,
surgical
,
and
diagnostic
instruments
,
uniform
,
and
similar
items
of
historical
medico-military
significance
.
During
the
period
,
the
laboratory
rendered
centralized
macropathological
service
to
qualified
requesters
.
Specimens
were
mounted
for
military_installations
,
governmental
agencies
,
and
medical_schools
.
Three
hundred
five
copies
of
the
Manual
of
Macropathological
Techniques
were
distributed
.
Thirty-five
military
and
civilian
students
received
laboratory
training
.
During
fiscal_years
1959
and
1960
,
there
were
795586
visitors
to
the
Museum
.
During
the
period
from
1
July
1960
through
31
January
1961
,
the
Medical_Museum
was
required
to
move
to
Temporary
Building
``
S
''
on
the
Mall
from
Chase_Hall
.
Throughout
the
period
and
during
the
movement
operation
,
the
Museum
continued
its
functional
support
of
the
Armed_Forces
Institute
of
Pathology
.
The
Armed_Forces
Medical
Publication
Agency
,
established
in
1949
,
has
published
,
since
January
1950
,
the
United_States
Armed_Forces
Medical_Journal
as
a
triservice
publication
to
furnish
material
of
professional
interest
to
Medical_Department
officers
of
the
three
military_services
.
Its
supplement
,
the
Medical
Technicians
Bulletin
,
supplied
similar
material_to
enlisted
medical
personnel
.
These
publications
replaced
the
U._S._Naval_Medical_Bulletin
,
published
continuously
from
1907
through
1959
,
as_well_as
the
Navy
's
Hospital_Corps
Quarterly
and
the
Bulletin
of
the
U._S._Army_Medical_Department
,
published
from
1922
to
1949
.
In_addition
,
their
establishment
made
it
unnecessary
to
begin
publication
of
a
contemplated
Air_Force
medical
bulletin
.
Estimated
annual
savings
resulting
from
publication
of
the
Journal
and
Bulletin
on
a
triservice
basis
,
as
compared
with
the
cost
of
producing
separate
periodicals
for
each
service
,
were
between
$
65000
and
$
70000
.
Additionally
,
on
the
many
ships
at_sea
and
in
the
smaller
naval
stations
,
the
availability
of
the
Journal
removed
the
necessity
of
subscribing_to
several
additional
journals
of
civilian
origin
over
and
above
the
quantity
now
authorized
,
in_order_to
provide
any
reasonably
comparable
coverage
.
From
1
July
1958
to
30
June
1960
,
24
numbers
of
the
Journal
and
nine
of
the
Bulletin
were
published
.
Each
Journal
contained
articles
of
professional
and
clinical
interest
,
and
departments
devoted
to
military
medical
news
,
reviews
of
new
books
,
and
other
features
of
interest
to
officers
of
the
medical
services
.
The
Council
on
National_Defense
of
the
American_Medical_Association
contributed
a
brief
article
to
each
issue
entitled
,
``
This
is
Your
A.
M.
A
.
''
.
Beginning
with
the
October
1959
issue
of
the
Journal
,
the
method
of
production
of
copy
for
photo-offset
reproduction
was
changed
from
varityping
to
hot
typesetting
.
This
resulted
in
an
improved
appearance
,
but
was
followed
by
an
increase
in
printing
cost
that
necessitated
the
institution
of
major
economies
to
keep
within
the
total
of
allocated
funds
.
The
use
of
100
instead
of
140
substance
paper
plus
the
adoption
of
side
stapling
beginning
with
the
May
1960
issue
reduced
costs
sufficiently
to
allow
completion
of
the
fiscal_year
with
nearly
$
4000
in
unexpended
funds
.
Two
special
issues
were
published
,
one
for
November
1959
on
Space_Medicine
,
the
other
the
Tenth_Anniversary
issue
for
January
1960
.
The
February
1960
issue
marked
the
reinstitution
of
the
section
entitled
,
``
The
Medical_Officer_Writes
''
.
Replacing
the
discontinued
Medical
Technicians
Bulletin
,
publication
of_which
was
suspended
with
the
November-December
1959
issue
,
a
section
called
``
Technical
Notes
''
was
inaugurated
on
a
bimonthly
basis
beginning
with
the
April
1960
issue
.
Occasional
features
were
published
on
historical
medicine
,
special
reports
,
bibliography
,
and
``
Collector
's
Items
''
.
In
May
1960
,
the
Armed_Forces
Institute
of
Pathology
began
a
series
of
articles
on
the
``
Medical_Museum
''
,
and
in
June
,
the
Institute
started
contributing
a
regular
monthly
``
Case
for
Diagnosis
''
.
The
Institute
also
planned
to
furnish
a
regular
series
of
articles
,
beginning
in
the
fall
of
1960
,
on
its
more
significant
Scientific
Exhibits
.
The
Armed_Forces
Epidemiological
Board
agreed
to
submit
each_month
a
report
for
one
of
its
12
commissions
,
so_that
each
commission
will
report
once
a
year
on
some
phase
of
its
work
calculated
to
be
of
particular
interest
and
value
to
medical_officers
of
the
Armed_Forces
.
The
first
report
in_this
continuing
series
appeared
in
the
September
1960
issue
of
the
Journal
.
