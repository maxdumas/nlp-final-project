City_Controller_Alexander_Hemphill
charged
Tuesday
that
the
bids
on
the
Frankford_Elevated
repair
project
were
rigged
to
the
advantage
of
a
private
contracting
company
which
had
``
an
inside
track
''
with
the
city
.
Estimates
of
the
city
's
loss
in
the
$
344000
job
have
ranged
as
high
as
$
200000
.
Hemphill
said
that
the
Hughes_Steel_Erection_Co.
contracted
to
do
the
work
at
an
impossibly
low
cost
with
a
bid
that
was
far
less_than
the
``
legitimate
''
bids
of
competing
contractors
.
The
Hughes
concern
then
took
``
shortcuts
''
on
the
project
but
got
paid
anyway
,
Hemphill
said
.
The
Controller
's
charge
of
rigging
was
the
latest
development
in
an
investigation
which
also
brought
these
disclosures
Tuesday
:
The
city
has
sued
for
the
full
amount
of
the
$
172400
performance_bond
covering
the
contract
.
The
Philadelphia_Transportation_Co.
is
investigating
the
part
its
organization
played
in
reviewing
the
project
.
The
signature
of
Harold_V._Varani
,
former
director
of
architecture
and
engineering
in
the
Department
of
Public_Property
,
appeared
on
payment
vouchers
certifying
work
on
the
project
.
Varani
has
been
fired
on
charges
of
accepting
gifts
from
the
contractor
.
Managing_Director
Donald_C._Wagner
has
agreed
to
cooperate
fully
with
Hemphill
after
a
period
of
sharp
disagreement
on
the_matter
.
The
announcement
that
the
city
would
sue
for
recovery
on
the
performance_bond
was
made
by
City_Solicitor_David_Berger
at
a
press_conference
following
a
meeting
in
the
morning
with
Wagner
and
other
officials
of
the
city
and
the
PTC
as_well
as
representatives
of
an
engineering
firm
that
was
pulled_off
the
El
project
before
its
completion
in
1959
.
The
Hughes
company
and
the
Consolidated
Industries
,
Inc.
,
both
of
3646
N.
2
d
st.
,
filed
for
reorganization
under
the
Federal
bankruptcy
law
.
On
Monday
,
the
Hughes
concern
was
formally
declared
bankrupt
after
its
directors
indicated
they
could
not
draw_up
a
plan
for
reorganization
.
Business_relations
between
the
companies
and
city
have
been
under
investigation
by
Hemphill
and
District_Attorney
James_C._Crumlish
,
Jr.
.
The
suit
was
filed
later
in
the
day
in
Common
Pleas
Court
7
against
the
Hughes
company
and
two
bonding
firms
.
Travelers_Indemnity_Co.
and
the
Continental_Casualty_Co.
.
At
Berger
's
direction
,
the
city
also
intervened
in
the
Hughes
bankruptcy
case
in
U._S._District_Court
in
a
move
preliminary
to
filing
a
claim
there
.
``
I
am
taking
the
position
that
the
contract
was
clearly
violated
''
,
Berger
said
.
The
contract
violations
mostly
involve
failure
to
perform
rehabilitation
work
on
expansion
joints
along
the
El
track
.
The
contract
called_for
overhauling
of
102
joints
.
The
city
paid
for
work
on
75
,
of_which
no_more_than
21
were
repaired
,
Hemphill
charged
.
Hemphill
said
the
Hughes
concern
contracted
to
do
the
repairs
at
a
cost
of
$
500
for
each
joint
.
The
bid
from
A._Belanger
and
Sons
of
Cambridge
,
Mass.
,
which
listed
the
same
officers
as
Hughes
,
was
$
600
per
joint
.
But
,
Hemphill
added
,
bids
from
other
contractors
ranged
from
$
2400
to
$
3100
per
joint
.
Berger
's
decision
to
sue
for
the
full
amount
of
the
performance_bond
was
questioned
by
Wagner
in
the
morning
press_conference
.
Wagner
said
the
city
paid
only
$
37500
to
the
Hughes
company
.
``
We
won
n't
know
the
full
amount
until
we
get
a
full
report
''
,
Wagner
said
.
``
We
can
claim
on
the
maximum
amount
of
the
bond
''
,
Berger
said
.
Wagner
replied
,
``
Ca
n't
you
just
see
the
headline
:
'
City
Hooked
for
$
172000
''
'
?
Berger
insisted
that
``
we
know
enough
to
sue
for
the
full
amount
''
.
Douglas_M._Pratt
,
president
of
the
PTC
,
who
attended
the
meeting
,
said
the
transit
company
is
reviewing
the
work
on
the
El
.
``
We
want
to
find_out
who
knew
about
it
''
,
Pratt
said
.
``
Certain
people
must
have
known
about
it
''
.
``
The
PTC
is
investigating
the
whole
matter
''
,
Pratt
said
.
Samuel_D._Goodis
,
representing
the
Philadelphia_Hotel_Association
,
objected
on
Tuesday
to
a
proposed
boost
by
the
city
in
licensing_fees
,
saying
that
occupancy_rates
in
major
hotels
here
ranged
from
48
to
74
percent
last
year
.
Goodis
voiced
his
objection
before
City_Council
's
Finance_Committee
.
For
hotels
with
1000
rooms
,
the
increased
license
fee
would
mean
an
expense
of
$
5000
a
year
,
Goodis
said
.
His
testimony
came
during
a
hearing
on
a
bill
raising
fees
for
a
wide
variety
of
licenses
,
permits
and
city
services
.
The
new
fees
are
expected
to
raise
an
additional
$
740000
in
the
remainder
of
1961
and
$
2330000
more
a
year
after_that
.
The
ordinance
would
increase
the
fee
for
rooming_houses
,
hotels
and
multi-family
dwellings
to
$
5
a
room
.
The
cost
of
a
license
now
is
$
2
,
with
an
annual
renewal
fee
of
$
1
.
Goodis
said
that
single
rooms
account_for
95
percent
of
the
accomodations
in
some
hotels
.
The
city
expects
the
higher
rooming_house
,
hotel
and
apartment
house
fees
to
bring_in
an
additional
$
457000
a
year
.
The
increase
also
was
opposed
by
Leonard_Kaplan
,
spokesman
for
the
Home
Builders
Association
of
Philadelphia
,
on
behalf
of
association
members
who
operate
apartment
houses
.
A
proposal
to
raise
dog
license
fees
drew
an
objection
from
Councilwoman_Virginia_Knauer
,
who
formerly
raised
pedigreed
dogs
.
The
ordinance
would
increase
fees
from
$
1
for
males
and
$
2
for
females
to
a
flat
$
5
a
dog
.
Mrs._Knauer
said
she
did
not
think
dog
owners
should
be
penalized
for
the
city
's
services
to
animal
care
.
In_reply
,
Deputy
Police_Commissioner
Howard_R._Leary
said
that
the
city
spends
more_than
$
115000
annually
to
license
and
regulate
dogs
but
collects
only
$
43000
in
fees
.
He
reported
that
the
city
's
contributions
for
animal
care
included
$
67000
to
the
Women
's
S._P._C._A.
;
$
15000
to
pay
six
policemen
assigned
as
dog_catchers
and
$
15000
to
investigate
dog_bites
.
City_Finance_Director_Richard_J._McConnell
indorsed
the
higher
fees
,
which
,
he
said
,
had
been
under
study
for
more_than
a
year
.
The
city
is
not
adequately
compensated
for
the
services
covered
by
the
fees
,
he
said
.
The
new
fee
schedule
also
was
supported
by
Commissioner
of
Licenses
and
Inspections_Barnet_Lieberman
and
Health_Commissioner_Eugene_A._Gillis
.

The
City_Planning
Commission
on
Tuesday
approved
agreements
between
two
redevelopers
and
the
Redevelopment_Authority
for
the
purchase
of
land
in
the
$
300000000
Eastwick_Redevelopment_Area
project
.
The
commission
also
approved
a
novel
plan
that
would
eliminate
traffic
hazards
for
pedestrians
in
the
project
.
One
of
the
agreements
calls_for
the
New_Eastwick_Corp.
to
purchase
a
1311
acre
tract
for
$
12192865
.
The
tract
is
bounded
by
Island_ave.
,
Dicks_ave.
,
61
st
st.
,
and
Eastwick_ave.
.
It
is
designated
as
Stage
1
Residential
on
the
Redevelopment_Authority
's
master_plan
and
will
feature
row_houses
,
garden
apartments
,
four
small
parks
,
schools
,
churches
,
a
shopping_center
and
several
small
clusters
of
stores
.
The
corporation
was
formed
by
the
Reynolds_Metal_Co.
and
the
Samuel_A.
and
Henry_A._Berger
firm
,
a
Philadelphia
builder
,
for
work
in
the
project
.
The
second
agreement
permits
the
authority
to
sell
a
520
-
acre
tract
west
of
Stage
1
Residential
to
Philadelphia
Builders
Eastwick_Corp.
,
a
firm
composed
of
10
Philadelphia
area
builders
,
which
is
interested
in
developing
part
of
the
project
.
The
plan
for
eliminating
traffic
hazards
for
pedestrians
was
developed
by
Dr._Constantinos_A._Doxiadis
,
former
Minister
of
Reconstruction
in
Greece
and
a
consulting
planner
for
the
New_Eastwick_Corp.
.
The
plan
calls_for
dividing
the
project
into
16
sectors
which
would
be
barred
to
vehicular_traffic
.
It
provides_for
a
series
of
landscaped
walkways
and
a
central
esplanade
that
would
eventually
run
through
the
center
of
the
entire
two-and-a-half-mile
length
of
the
project
.
The
esplanade
eliminates
Grovers_ave.
,
which
on
original
plans
ran
through
the
center
of
the
development
.
The
esplanade
would
feature
pedestrian_bridges
over
roads
in
the
project
.
The
president
of

local
of
the
International_Association
of
Fire_Fighters
was
severly
injured
today
when
a
bomb
tore
his
car
apart
as
he
left
home
for
work
.

,
the
central
figure
in
a
representation
dispute
between
the
fire_fighters
association
and
the
teamsters
union
,
suffered
multiple
fractures
of
both
ankles
.
He
was
in
Baptist_Memorial
hospital
.
The
battalion
chief
said
he
had
just
gotten_into
his
1958
model
automobile
to
move
it
from
the
driveway
of
his
home
so_that
he
could
take
his
other
car
to
work
.
``
I
'd
just
turned_on
the
ignition
when
there
was
a
big
flash
and
I
was_lying
on
the
driveway
''
,
he
said
.
Gladden
's
wife
and
two
of
his
sons
,
John
,
17
,
and
Jim
,
13
,
were
inside
the
house
.
The
younger
boy
said
the
blast
knocked
him
out_of_bed
and
against
the
wall
.
The
explosion
sent
the
hood
of
the
car
flying
over
the
roof
of
the
house
.
The
left
front
wheel
landed
100
feet
away
.
Police
laboratory
technicians
said
the
explosive_device
,
containing
either
TNT
or
nitroglycerine
,
was
apparently
placed
under
the
left
front
wheel
.
It
was
first
believed
the
bomb
was
rigged
to
the
car
's
starter
.
Gladden
had
been
the
target
of
threatening
telephone_calls
in
recent
months
and
reportedly
received
one
last
night
.
The
fire_department
here
has
been
torn
for
months
by
dissension
involving
top
personnel
and
the
fight
between
the
fire_fighters
association
and
the
teamsters
union
.
Gladden
has
been
an
outspoken
critic
of
the
present
city
administration
and
led
his
union
's
battle
against
the
teamsters
,
which
began
organizing
city
firemen
in
1959
.
The
fire_fighters
association
here
offered
a
$
5000
reward
for
information
leading
to
the
arrest
of
the
person
or
persons
responsible_for
the
bombing
.
A
$
500
reward
was
offered
by
the
association
's
local
in
Kansas_City
,
Kas.
.
The
association
said
it
would
post
24
hour
guards
at
Gladden
's
home
and
at
those
of
James_Mining
and
Eugene_Shiflett
.
Mining
is
secretary-treasurer
of
the
local
and
Shiflett
is
a
member
of
its
executive
committee
.
Both
have
been
active
in
the
association
.
Turkish
political_leaders
bowed
today
to
military
pressure
and
agreed
to
form
an
emergency
national
front
government
with
Gen._Cemal_Gursel
as
president
.
An
agreement
between
the
leaders
of
four
parties
which
contested
indecisive
elections
on
Oct.
15
was
reached
after
almost
18
hours
of
political
bargaining
under
the
threat
of
an
army
coup
d
'
etat
.
By-passing
the
military
junta
which
has
ruled
Turkey
since
the
overthrow
of
Premier_Adnan_Menderes
17
months
ago
,
the
army
general_staff
,
led
by
Gen._Cedvet_Sunay
,
had
set
a
deadline
for
the
parties
to
join
in
a
national
coalition
government
.
The
army
leaders
threatened
to
form
a
new
military
government
if
the
parties
failed
to
sign
an
eight
point
protocol
agreeing
on
Gen._Gursel
as
president
.
Gen._Gursel
has
headed
the
military
junta
the
last
17
months
.
The
military
also
had
demanded
pledges
that
there
would
be
no
changes
in
the
laws
passed
by
the
junta
and
no
leaders
of
the
Menderes
regime
now
in
prison
would
be
pardoned
.
Party
leaders
came_out
of
the
final
meeting
apparently
satisfied
and
stated
that
complete
agreement
had
been
reached
on
a
solution
to
the
crisis
created
by
the
elections
which
left
no
party
with
enough
strength
to
form
a
government
on
its
own
.
