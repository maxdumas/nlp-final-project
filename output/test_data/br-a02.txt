Committee
approval
of
Gov._Price_Daniel
's
``
abandoned
property
''
act
seemed
certain
Thursday
despite
the
adamant
protests
of
Texas
bankers
.
Daniel
personally
led
the
fight
for
the
measure
,
which
he
had
watered_down
considerably
since
its
rejection
by
two
previous
Legislatures
,
in
a
public
hearing
before
the
House_Committee_on_Revenue_and_Taxation
.
Under
committee
rules
,
it
went
automatically
to
a
subcommittee
for
one
week
.
But
questions
with
which
committee_members
taunted
bankers
appearing
as
witnesses
left
little
doubt
that
they
will
recommend
passage
of_it
.
Daniel
termed
``
extremely
conservative
''
his
estimate
that
it
would
produce
17
million
dollars
to
help
erase
an
anticipated
deficit
of
63
million
dollars
at
the
end
of
the
current
fiscal_year
next
Aug.
31
.
He
told
the
committee
the
measure
would
merely
provide
means
of
enforcing
the
escheat
law
which
has
been
on_the_books
``
since
Texas
was
a
republic
''
.
It
permits
the
state
to
take_over
bank_accounts
,
stocks
and
other
personal_property
of
persons
missing
for
seven
years
or
more
.
The
bill
,
which
Daniel
said
he
drafted
personally
,
would
force
banks
,
insurance_firms
,
pipeline_companies
and
other
corporations
to
report
such
property
to
the
state_treasurer
.
The
escheat
law
cannot
be
enforced
now
because
it
is
almost
impossible
to
locate
such
property
,
Daniel
declared
.
Dewey_Lawrence
,
a
Tyler
lawyer
representing
the
Texas_Bankers_Association
,
sounded
the
opposition
keynote
when
he
said
it
would
force
banks
to
violate
their
contractual
obligations
with
depositors
and
undermine
the
confidence
of
bank
customers
.
``
If
you
destroy
confidence
in
banks
,
you
do
something
to
the
economy
''
,
he
said
.
``
You
take
out_of
circulation
many
millions
of
dollars
''
.
Rep._Charles_E._Hughes
of
Sherman
,
sponsor
of
the
bill
,
said
a
failure
to
enact
it
would
``
amount
to
making
a
gift
out_of
the
taxpayers
'
pockets
to
banks
,
insurance
and
pipeline_companies
''
.
His
contention
was
denied
by
several
bankers
,
including
Scott_Hudson
of
Sherman
,
Gaynor_B._Jones
of
Houston
,
J._B._Brady
of
Harlingen
and
Howard_Cox
of
Austin
.
Cox
argued
that
the
bill
is
``
probably
unconstitutional
''
since
,
he
said
,
it
would
impair
contracts
.
He
also
complained
that
not
enough
notice
was
given
on
the
hearing
,
since
the
bill
was
introduced
only
last
Monday
.
Senators
unanimously
approved
Thursday
the
bill
of
Sen._George_Parkhouse
of
Dallas
authorizing
establishment
of
day_schools
for
the
deaf
in
Dallas
and
the
four
other
largest
counties
.
The
bill
is
designed
to
provide
special
schooling
for
more
deaf
students
in
the
scholastic
age
at
a
reduced
cost
to
the
state
.
There
was
no
debate
as
the
Senate
passed
the
bill
on
to
the
House
.
It
would
authorize
the
Texas_Education_Agency
to
establish
county-wide
day_schools
for
the
deaf
in
counties
of
300000
or
more
population
,
require
deaf
children
between
6
and
13
years
of_age
to
attend
the
day_schools
,
permitting
older
ones
to
attend
the
residential
Texas_School_for_the_Deaf
here
.
Operating_budget
for
the
day_schools
in
the
five
counties
of
Dallas
,
Harris
,
Bexar
,
Tarrant
and
El_Paso
would
be
$
451500
,
which
would
be
a
savings
of
$
157460
yearly
after
the
first
year
's
capital
outlay
of
$
88000
was
absorbed
,
Parkhouse
told
the
Senate
.
The
TEA
estimated
there
would
be
182
scholastics
to
attend
the
day_school
in
Dallas_County
,
saving
them
from
coming
to
Austin
to
live
in
the
state
deaf
school
.
Dallas
may
get_to
hear
a
debate
on
horse_race
parimutuels
soon
between
Reps._V._E._Red_Berry
and
Joe_Ratcliff
.
While
details
are
still
be
to
worked_out
,
Ratcliff
said
he
expects
to
tell
home_folks
in
Dallas
why
he
thinks
Berry
's
proposed
constitutional
amendment
should
be
rejected
.
``
We
're
getting
more
'
pro
'
letters
than
'
con
'
on
horse_race
betting
''
,
said
Ratcliff
.
``
But
I
believe
if
people
were
better
informed
on
this
question
,
most_of
them
would
oppose
it
also
.
I'm
willing
to
stake
my
political
career
on_it
''
.
Rep._Berry
,
an
ex_gambler
from
San_Antonio
,
got
elected
on
his
advocacy
of
betting_on
the
ponies
.
A
House
committee
which
heard
his
local_option
proposal
is
expected
to
give
it
a
favorable
report
,
although
the
resolution
faces
hard_sledding
later
.
The
House
passed
finally
,
and
sent
to
the
Senate
,
a
bill
extending
the
State_Health_Department
's
authority
to
give
planning
assistance
to
cities
.
The
Senate
quickly
whipped_through
its
meager
fare
of
House
bills
approved
by
committees
,
passing
the
three
on
the
calendar
.
One
validated
acts
of
school
districts
.
Another
enlarged
authority
of
the
Beaumont_Navigation_District
.
The
third
amended
the
enabling_act
for
creation
of
the
Lamar_county
Hospital_District
,
for
which
a
special
constitutional
amendment
previously
was
adopted
.
Without
dissent
,
senators
passed
a
bill
by
Sen._A._R._Schwartz
of
Galveston
authorizing
establishment
in
the
future
of
a
school
for
the
mentally_retarded
in
the
Gulf_Coast
district
.
Money
for
its
construction
will
be
sought
later_on
but
in_the_meantime
the
State_Hospital
board
can
accept
gifts
and
donations
of
a
site
.
Two
tax
revision
bills
were
passed
.
One
,
by
Sen._Louis_Crump
of
San_Saba
,
would
aid
more
than
17000
retailers
who
pay
a
group
of
miscellaneous
excise_taxes
by
eliminating
the
requirement
that
each
return
be
notarized
.
Instead
,
retailers
would
sign
a
certificate
of
correctness
,
violation
of
which
would
carry
a
penalty
of
one
to
five
years
in
prison
,
plus
a
$
1000
fine
.
It
was
one
of
a
series
of
recommendations
by
the
Texas_Research_League
.
The
other
bill
,
by
Sen._A._M._Aikin_Jr.
of
Paris
,
would
relieve
real_estate_brokers
,
who
pay
their
own
annual
licensing_fee
,
from
the
$
12
annual
occupation_license
on
brokers
in
such_as
stocks
and
bonds
.
Natural_gas
public_utility
companies
would
be
given
the
right
of
eminent_domain
,
under
a
bill
by
Sen._Frank_Owen
/3
,
of
El_Paso
,
to
acquire
sites
for
underground
storage
reservoirs
for
gas
.
Marshall_Formby
of
Plainview
,
former
chairman
of
the
Texas_Highway_Commission
,
suggested
a
plan
to
fill
by
appointment
future
vacancies
in
the
Legislature
and
Congress
,
eliminating
the
need
for
costly
special
elections
.
Under
Formby
's
plan
,
an
appointee
would
be
selected
by
a
board
composed
of
the
governor
,
lieutenant_governor
,
speaker
of
the
House
,
attorney_general
and
chief_justice
of
the
Texas_Supreme_Court
.
State
representatives
decided
Thursday
against
taking_a_poll
on
what
kind
of
taxes
Texans
would
prefer
to
pay
.
An
adverse
vote
of
81
to
65
kept
in
the
State_Affairs_Committee
a
bill
which
would
order
the
referendum
on
the
April
4
ballot
,
when
Texas
votes
on
a
U.S.
senator
.
Rep._Wesley_Roberts
of
Seminole
,
sponsor
of
the
poll
idea
,
said
that
further
delay
in
the
committee
can
kill
the
bill
.
The
West_Texan
reported
that
he
had
finally
gotten
Chairman_Bill_Hollowell
of
the
committee
to
set
it
for
public
hearing
on
Feb.
22
.
The
proposal
would
have
to
receive
final
legislative
approval
,
by
two-thirds
majorities
,
before
March
1
to
be
printed
on
the
April
4
ballot
,
Roberts
said
.
Opponents
generally
argued
that
the
ballot
could
n't
give
enough
information
about
tax
proposals
for
the
voters
to
make
an
intelligent
choice
.
All
Dallas
members
voted
with
Roberts
,
except
Rep._Bill_Jones
,
who
was
absent
.
Paradise
lost
to
the
alleged
water
needs
of
Texas
'
big
cities
Thursday
.
Rep._James_Cotten
of
Weatherford
insisted
that
a
water_development
bill
passed
by
the
Texas
House_of_Representatives
was
an
effort
by
big
cities
like
Dallas
and
Fort_Worth
to
cover_up
places
like
Paradise
,
a
Wise_County
hamlet
of
250
people
.
When
the
shouting
ended
,
the
bill
passed
,
114
to
4
,
sending
it
to
the
Senate
,
where
a
similar
proposal
is
being
sponsored
by
Sen._George_Parkhouse
of
Dallas
.
Most
of
the
fire
was
directed
by
Cotten
against
Dallas
and
Sen._Parkhouse
.
The
bill
would
increase
from
$
5000000
to
$
15000000
the
maximum
loan
the
state
could
make
to
a
local
water_project
.
Cotten
construed
this
as
a
veiled
effort
by
Parkhouse
to
help
Dallas
and
other
large
cities
get
money
which
Cotten
felt
could
better
be
spent
providing
water
for
rural
Texas
.
Statements
by
other
legislators
that
Dallas
is
paying
for
all
its
water_program
by
local
bonds
,
and
that
less
populous
places
would
benefit
most
by
the
pending
bill
,
did
not
sway
Cotten
's
attack
.
The
bill
's
defenders
were
mostly
small-town
legislators
like
J._W._Buchanan
of
Dumas
,
Eligio_(_Kika_)_de_la_Garza
of
Mission
,
Sam_F._Collins
of
Newton
and
Joe_Chapman
of
Sulphur_Springs
.
``
This
is
a
poor
boy
's
bill
''
,
said
Chapman
.
``
Dallas
and
Fort_Worth
can
vote
bonds
.
This
would
help
the
little
peanut
districts
''
.
A
Houston
teacher
,
now
serving
in
the
Legislature
,
proposed
Thursday
a
law
reducing
the
time
spent
learning
``
educational
methods
''
.
Rep._Henry_C._Grover
,
who
teaches
history
in
the
Houston
public_schools
,
would
reduce
from
24
to
12
semester_hours
the
so-called
``
teaching_methods
''
courses
required
to
obtain
a
junior
or
senior_high_school
teaching_certificate
.
A
normal
year
's
work
in
college
is
30
semester_hours
.
Grover
also
would
require
junior
senior_high
teachers
to
have
at_least
24
semester_hours
credit
in
the
subject
they
are
teaching
.
The
remainder
of
the
4
-
year
college
requirement
would
be
in_general
subjects
.
``
A
person
with
a
master's_degree
in
physics
,
chemistry
,
math
or
English
,
yet
who
has
not
taken
Education
courses
,
is
not
permitted
to
teach
in
the
public_schools
''
,
said
Grover
.
College
teachers
in
Texas
are
not
required
to
have
the
Education
courses
.
Fifty-three
of
the
150
representatives
immediately
joined
Grover
as
co-signers
of
the
proposal
.
The
board_of_regents
of
Paris_Junior_College
has
named
Dr._Clarence_Charles_Clark
of
Hays
,
Kan.
as
the
school
's
new
president
.
Dr._Clark
will
succeed
Dr._J._R._McLemore
,
who
will
retire
at
the
close
of
the
present
school_term
.
Dr._Clark
holds
an
earned
Doctor_of_Education
degree
from
the
University_of_Oklahoma
.
He
also
received
a
Master_of_Science
degree
from
Texas_A+I_College
and
a
Bachelor_of_Science
degree
from
Southwestern_State_College
,
Weatherford
,
Okla.

In_addition
,
Dr._Clark

schools
in

Supt._Chester_O._Strickland
.
State
and
federal
legislation
against
racial
discrimination
in
employment
was
called_for
yesterday
in
a
report
of
a
``
blue_ribbon
''
citizens_committee
on
the
aid
to
dependent
children
program
.
The
report
,
culminating
a
year
long
study
of
the
ADC
program
in
Cook
county
by
a
New_York_City
welfare
consulting_firm
,
listed
10
long_range
recommendations
designed
to
reduce
the
soaring
ADC
case_load
.
The
report
called
racial
discrimination
in
employment
``
one
of
the
most
serious
causes
of
family
breakdown
,
desertion
,
and
ADC
dependency
''
.
The
monthly
cost
of
ADC
to
more
than
100000
recipients
in
the
county
is
4.4
million
dollars
,
said
C._Virgil_Martin
,
president
of
Carson_Pirie_Scott_+_Co.
,
committee
chairman
.
``
We
must
solve
the
problems
which
have
forced
these
people
to
depend_upon
ADC
for
subsistence
''
,
Martin
said
.
The
volume
of
ADC
cases
will
decrease
,
Martin
reported
,
when
the
community
is
able
to
deal
effectively
with
two
problems
:
Relatively
limited
skills
and
discrimination
in
employment
because
of
color
.
These
,
he
said
,
are
``
two
of
the
principal
underlying
causes
for
family
breakups
leading
to
ADC
''
.
Other
recommendations
made
by
the
committee
are
:
Extension
of
the
ADC
program
to
all
children
in
need
living
with
any
relatives
,
including
both
parents
,
as
a
means
of
preserving
family
unity
.
Research
projects
as
soon
as
possible
on
the
causes
and
prevention
of
dependency
and
illegitimacy
.
