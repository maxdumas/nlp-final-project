At
a
closed-door
session
on
Capitol_Hill
last
week
,
Secretary_of_State
Christian_Herter
made
his
final
report
to
the
Senate_Foreign
Relations
Committee
on
U._S.
affairs
abroad
.
Afterward
,
Tennessee
's
Democratic
Senator_Albert_Gore
summed
it
up
for
newsmen
.
What
Herter
presented
,
said
Gore
,
was
``
not
a
very
encouraging
review
''
.
That
was
something
of
an
understatement
in
a
week
when
the
underlying
conflict
between
the
West
and
Communism
erupted
on
three
fronts
.
While
Communists
were
undermining
United_Nations
efforts
to
rescue
the
Congo
from
chaos
,
two
other
Communist
offensives
stirred
the
Eisenhower_Administration
into
emergency
conferences
and
serious
decisions
.
Hours
after
a
parade
of
his
new
Soviet
tanks
and
artillery
,
Dictator_Fidel_Castro
suddenly
confronted
the
U._S.
with
a
blunt
and
drastic
demand
:
within
48
hours
,
the
U._S.
had
to
reduce
its
embassy
and
consulate
staffs
in
Cuba
to
a
total
of
eleven
persons
(
the
embassy
staff
alone
totaled
87
U._S.
citizens
,
plus
120
Cuban
employees
)
.
President_Eisenhower
held
an
8
:
30
a.
m.
meeting
with
top
military
and
foreign-policy
advisers
,
decided
to
break_off
diplomatic
relations
immediately
.
``
There
is
a
limit
to
what
the
United_States
in
self-respect
can
endure
''
,
said
the
President
.
``
That
limit
has
now
been
reached
''
.
Through
Secretary_Herter
,
Ike
offered
President-elect_Kennedy
an
opportunity
to
associate
his
new
Administration
with
the
breakoff
decision
.
Kennedy
,
through
Secretary-designate
of
State_Dean_Rusk
,
declined
.
He
thus
kept
his
hands
free
for
any
action
after
Jan.
20
,
although
reaction
to
the
break
was
generally
favorable
in
the
U._S.
and
Latin_America
(
see
The
Hemisphere
)
.
After
a
White_House
huddle
between
the
President
and
top
lieutenants
,
the
Defense_Department
reacted
sharply
to
a
cry
from
the
pro-Western
government
of
Laos
that
several
battalions
of
Communist
troops
had
invaded
Laos
from
North
Viet_Nam
.
``
In_view
of
the
present
situation
in
Laos
''
,
said
the
Pentagon
's
announcement
,
``
we
are
taking
normal
precautionary
actions
to
increase
the
readiness
of
our
forces
in
the
Pacific
''
.
Cutting_short
a
holiday
at
Hong_Kong
,
the
aircraft_carriers
Lexington
and
Bennington
steamed
off
into
the
South_China_Sea
,
accompanied
by
a
swarm
of
destroyers
,
plus
troopships
loaded
with
marines
.
On
the
U._S
.
's
island
base
of
Okinawa
,
Task_Force
116
,
made_up
of
Army
,
Navy
,
Marine
and
Air_Force
units
,
got
braced
to
move
southward
on
signal
.
But
by
week
's
end
the
Laotian
cry
of
invasion
was
read
as
an
exaggeration
(
see
Foreign_News
)
,
and
the
U._S.
was
agreeing
with
its
cautious
British
and
French
allies
that
a
neutralist
-
rather_than
a
pro-Western
-
government
might
be
best
for
Laos
.
There
was
a
moral
of
sorts
in
the
Laotian
situation
that
said
much
about
all
other
cold-war
fronts
.
Political
,
economic
and
military
experts
were
all
agreed
that
chaotic
,
mountainous
little
Laos
was
the
last
place
in
the
world
to
fight
a
war
-
and
they
were
probably
right
.
``
It
would
be
like
fighting
the_French
and
Indian_War
all_over
again
''
,
said
one
military_man
.
But
why
was
Laos
the
new
Southeast
Asian
battleground
?
At
Geneva
in
1954
,
to
get
the
war
in
Indo-China
settled
,
the_British
and
French
gave_in
to
Russian
and
Communist
Chinese
demands
and
agreed
to
the
setting_up
of
a
Communist
state
,
North
Viet_Nam
-
which
then
,
predictably
,
became
a
base
for
Communist
operations
against
neighboring
South
Viet_Nam
and
Laos
.
The
late
Secretary_of_State
John_Foster_Dulles
considered
the
1954
Geneva
agreement
a
specimen
of
appeasement
,
saw
that
resolution
would
be
needed
to
keep
it
from
becoming
a
calamity
for
the
West
.
He
began
the
diplomatic
discussions
that
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
SEATO
.
``
The
important
thing
from_now_on
''
,
he
said
,
``
is
not
to
mourn
the
past
but
to
seize
the
future
opportunity
to
prevent
the
loss
in
northern
Viet_Nam
from
leading
to
the
extension
of
Communism
throughout
Southeast_Asia
''
.
Russian
tanks
and
artillery
parading
through
the
streets
of
Havana
,
Russian
intrigue
in
the
Congo
,
and
Russian
arms
drops
in
Laos
(
using
the
same
Ilyushin
transports
that
were
used
to
carry
Communist
agents
to
the
Congo
)
made
it
plain
once_more
that
the
cold_war
was
all_of
a_piece
in
space
and
time
.
Soviet
Premier_Khrushchev
sent
New_Year
's
hopes
for
peace
to
President-elect_Kennedy
,
and
got
a
cool
acknowledgment
in_reply
.
Considering
the
state
of
the
whole
world
,
the
cold_war
's
three
exposed
fronts
did
not
seem
terribly
ominous
;
but
,
in
Senator_Gore
's
words
,
it
was
``
not
a
very
encouraging
''
situation
that
would
confront
John_F._Kennedy
on
Inauguration_Day
.
As
the
87
th
Congress
began
its
sessions
last
week
,
liberal
Democrats
were
ready
for
a
finish
fight
to
open
the
sluice
gates
controlled
by
the
House_Rules_Committee
and
permit
the
free
flow
of
liberal
legislation
to
the
floor
.
The
liberal
pressure
bloc
(
which
coyly
masquerades
under
the
name
Democratic
Study_Group
)
had
fought
the
committee
before
,
and
had
always
lost
.
This
time
,
they
were
much
better
prepared
and
organized
,
and
the
political
climate
was
favorable
.
They
had
the
unspoken
support
of
President-elect_Kennedy
,
whose
own
legislative
program
was
menaced
by
the
Rules_Committee
bottleneck
.
And
counting
noses
,
they
seemed
to
have
the
votes
to
work
their
will
.
There
were
two
possible
methods
of
breaching
the
conservative
barriers
around
the
Rules_Committee
:
1
)
to
pack
it
with
additional
liberals
and
break
the
conservative-liberal
deadlock
,
or
2
)
to
remove
one
of
the
conservatives
-
namely
Mississippi
's
14
-
term
William_Meyers_Colmer
(
pronounced
Calmer
)
.
Caucusing
,
the
liberals
decided
to
go_after
Colmer
,
which
actually
was
the
more
drastic
course
,
since
seniority
in
the
House
is
next
to
godliness
.
A
dour
,
gangling
man
with
a
choppy
gait
,
Colmer
looks
younger
than
his
70
years
,
has
gradually
swung
from
a
moderate
,
internationalist
position
to_that
of
a
diehard
conservative
.
He
is
generally
and
initially
suspicious
of
any
federal
project
,
unless
it
happens
to
benefit
his
Gulf_Coast
constituents
.
He
is
,
of_course
,
a
segregationist
,
but
he
says
he
has
never
made
an
``
anti-Negro
''
speech
.
For
20
years
he
has
enjoyed
his
power
on
the
Rules_Committee
.
There
his
vote
,
along
with
those
of
Chairman_Howard_Smith
,
the
courtly
Virginia
judge
,
and
the
four
Republican
members
,
could
and
often
did
produce
a
6
-
6
deadlock
that
blocked
far-out
,
Democratic-sponsored
welfare
legislation
(
a
tactic
often
acceptable
to
the
Rayburn-Johnson
congressional
leadership
to
avoid
embarrassing
votes
)
.
There
was
sufficient
pretext
to
demand
Colmer
's
ouster
:
he
had
given
his
lukewarm
support
to
the
anti-Kennedy
electors
in
Mississippi
.
Reprisals
are
not
unheard
of
in
such
situations
,
but
the
recent
tendency
has
been
for
the
Congress
to
forgive
its
prodigal
sons
.
In
1949
the
Dixiecrats
escaped
unscathed
after
their
1948
rebellion
against
Harry_Truman
,
and
in
1957
,
after
Congressman_Adam_Clayton_Powell
campaigned
for
Dwight_Eisenhower
in
1956
,
his
fellow
Democrats
did
not
touch
his
committee
assignments
,
although
they
did
strip
him
temporarily
of
his
patronage
.
(
In
the
heat
of
the
anti-Colmer
drive
last
week
,
Judge_Smith
threatened
reprisal
against
Powell
.
Said
he
:
``
We
will
see
whether
whites
and
Negroes
are
treated
the
same
around
here
''
.
)
But
Speaker_Sam_Rayburn
,
after
huddling
in
Palm_Beach
with
President-elect_Kennedy
,
decided
that
this
year
something
had
to
be
done
about
the
Rules_Committee
-
and
that
he
was
the
only
man
who
could
do
anything
effective
.
In
a
tense
,
closed-door
session
with
Judge_Smith
,
Rayburn
attempted
to
work_out
a
compromise
:
to
add
three
new
members
to
the
Rules_Committee
(
two
Democrats
,
including
one
Southerner
,
and
one
Republican
)
.
Smith
flatly
rejected
the
offer
,
and
Mister_Sam
thereupon
decided
to
join
the
rebels
.
The
next
morning
he
summoned
a
group
of
top
Democrats
to
his
private
office
and
broke
the
news
:
he
would
lead
the
fight
to
oust
Colmer
,
whom
he
is
said
to
regard_as
``
an
inferior
man
''
.
News
of
Rayburn
's
commitment
soon
leaked_out
.
When
Missouri
's
Clarence_Cannon
got
the
word
,
he
turned
purple
.
``
Unconscionable
''
!
he
shouted
,
and
rushed_off
to
the
Speaker
's
Room
to
object
:
``
A
dangerous
precedent
''
!
Cannon
,
a
powerful
,
conservative
man
,
brought
welcome
support
to
the
Smith-Colmer
forces
:
as
chairman
of
the
Appropriations_Committee
,
he
holds_over
each
member
the
dreadful
threat
of
excluding
this
or
that
congressional_district
from
federal
pork-barrel
projects
.
Sitting
quietly
on
an
equally
big
pork_barrel
was
another
Judge_Smith
ally
,
Georgia
's
Carl_Vinson
,
chairman
of
the
Armed_Services
Committee
.
As
the
battle
raged
in
the
cloakrooms
and
caucuses
,
it
became
clear
that
Judge_Smith
could
lose
.
His
highest
count
of
supporters
numbered
72
-
and
he
needed
nearly
twice
that
number
to
control
the
260
-
member
Democratic
caucus
.
The
liberals
,
smelling
blood
,
were
faced
with
the
necessity
of
winning
three
big
votes
-
in
the
Democratic
Committee
on
Committees
,
in
the
full
party
caucus
,
and
on
the
floor
of
the
House
-
before
they
could
oust
Colmer
.
(
One
big
question
:
If
Colmer
was
to
be
purged
,
what
should
the
House
do
about
the
other
three
senior
Mississippians
who
supported
the
maverick
electors
?
)
In_all
three
arenas
,
they
seemed
certain
of
victory
-
especially
with
Sam_Rayburn
applying
his
whiplash
.
But
in
the
prospect
of
winning
the
battle
loomed
the
specter
of
losing
a
costlier
war
.
If
the
Southerners
were
sufficiently
aroused
,
they
could
very_well
cut
the
Kennedy
legislative
program
to
ribbons
from
their
vantage_point
of
committee
chairmanships
,
leaving
Sam_Rayburn
leading
a
truncated
,
unworkable
party
.
With_that
possibility
in
mind
,
Arkansas
'
Wilbur_Mills
deliberately
delayed
calling
a
meeting
of
the
Committee
on
Committees
,
and
coolheaded
Democrats
sought
to
bring
Rayburn
and
Smith
together
again
to
work_out
some
sort_of
face-saving
compromise
.
``
Here
are
two
old_men
,
mad
at
each
other
and
too
proud
to
pick_up
the
phone
''
,
said
a
House
Democratic
leader
.
``
One
wants
a_little
more
power
,
and
the
other
does
n't
want
to
give_up
any
''
.
The
Senate
launched
the
87
th
Congress
with
its
own
version
of
an
ancient
liberal-conservative
battle
,
but
in
contrast
with
the
House
's
guerrilla
war
it
seemed
as
pro_forma
as
a
Capitol
guide
's
speech
.
Question
at_issue
:
How
big
a
vote
should
be
necessary
to
restrict
Senate
debate
-
and
thereby
cut_off
legislation-delaying
filibusters
?
A
wide-ranging
,
bipartisan
force
-
from
Minnesota
's
Democratic
Hubert_Humphrey
to
Massachusetts
'
Republican_Leverett_Saltonstall
-
was
drawn_up
against
a
solid
phalanx
of
Southern
Democrats
,
who
have
traditionally
used
the
filibuster
to
stop
civil_rights
bills
.
New_Mexico
's
Clint_Anderson
offered
a
resolution
to
change
the
Senate
's
notorious
Rule
22
to
allow
three-fifths
of
the
Senators
present
and
voting
to
cut_off
debate
,
instead
of
the
current
hard-to-get
two-thirds
.
Fair_Dealer_Humphrey
upped
the
ante
,
asked
cloture
power
for
a
mere
majority
of
Senators
.
Georgia
's
Dick_Russell
objected
politely
,
and
the
battle
was
joined
.
Privately
,
the
liberals
admitted
that
the
Humphrey
amendment
had
no
chance
of
passage
.
Privately
,
they
also
admitted
that
their
hopes
for
Clint_Anderson
's
three-fifths
modification
depended_on
none
other_than
Republican_Richard_Nixon
.
In
1957
Nixon
delivered
a
significant
opinion
that
a
majority
of
Senators
had
the
power
to
adopt
new
rules
at
the
beginning
of
each
new
Congress
,
and
that
any
rules
laid_down
by
previous
Congresses
were
not
binding
.
Armed
with
the
Nixon
opinion
,
the
Senate
liberals
rounded_up
their
slim
majority
and
prepared
to
choke_off
debate
on
the
filibuster
battle
this
week
.
Hopefully
,
the
perennial
battle
of
Rule
22
then
would
be
fought
to
a
settlement
once_and_for_all
.
Since
Election_Day
,
Vice_President
Richard_Nixon
had
virtually
retired
-
by
his
own
wish
-
from
public
view
.
But
with
the
convening
of
the
new
Congress
,
he
was
the
public
man
again
,
presiding
over
the
Senate
until
John_Kennedy
's
Inauguration
.
One_day
last
week
,
Nixon
faced
a
painful
constitutional
chore
that
required
him
to
officiate
at
a
joint
session
of
Congress
to
hear
the
official
tally
of
the
Electoral_College
vote
,
and_then
to
make
``
sufficient
declaration
''
of
the
election
of
the
man
who
defeated
him
in
the
tight
1960
presidential
election
.
Nixon
fulfilled
his
assignment
with
grace
,
then
went
beyond
the
required
``
sufficient
declaration
''
.
``
This
is
the
first
time
in
100
years
that
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
announced
the
result
of
an
election
in_which
he
was
defeated
''
,
he
said
.
