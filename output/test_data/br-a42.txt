Though
President_John_F._Kennedy
was
primarily
concerned
with
the
crucial
problems
of
Berlin
and
disarmament
adviser
McCloy
's
unexpected
report
from
Khrushchev
,
his
new
enthusiasm
and
reliance_on
personal
diplomacy
involved
him
in
other
key
problems
of
U._S.
foreign_policy
last
week
.
High_up
on
the
President
's
priority
list
was
the
thorny
question
of
Bizerte
.
On
this
issue
,
the
President
received
a
detailed
report
from
his
U._N._Ambassador_Adlai_Stevenson
,
who
had
just
returned
from
Paris
,
and
Mr._Kennedy
asked
Stevenson
to
search
for
a
face-saving
way
-
for
both
Paris
and
Tunis
-
out
of
the
imbroglio
.
Ideally
,
the
President
would
like
the_French
to
agree
on
a
``
status_quo
ante
''
on
Bizerte
,
and
accept
a
new
timetable
for
withdrawing
their
forces
from
the
Mediterranean
base
.
To
continue
their
important
conversations
about
the
Tunisian
issue
and
the
whole
range
of
other
problems
,
Mr._Kennedy
invited
stevenson
to
Cape_Cod
for
the
weekend
.
The
President
also
discussed
the
Bizerte
deadlock
with
the
No.
2
man
in
the
Tunisian_Government
,
Defense_Minister_Bahi_Ladgham
,
who
flew
to
Washington
last
week
to
seek
U._S.
support
.
The
conversation
apparently
convinced
Mr._Kennedy
that
the
positions
of
France
and
Tunisia
were
not
irreconcilable
.
Through
Ladgham
,
Mr._Kennedy
sent
a
message
along
those
lines
to
Tunisian_President_Habib_Bourguiba
;
and
one
U._S.
official
said
:
``
The
key
question
now
is
which
side
picks_up
the
phone
first
''
.
On
the
Latin_American
front
,
the
President
held
talks
with
Secretary
of
the
Treasury_Douglas_Dillon
before
sending
him
to
Uruguay
and
the
Inter-American
Economic_and_Social_Council
(
which
the
President
himself
had
originally
hoped
to
attend
)
.
Main
purpose
of
the
meeting
:
To
discuss
President_Kennedy
's
Alliance
for
Progress
.
And
that
was
not
all
.
In
conferences
with
Nationalist_China
's
dapper
,
diminutive
Vice_President
Chen_Cheng
,
Mr._Kennedy
assured
Chiang_Kai-shek
's
emissary
that
the
U._S.
is
as
firmly
opposed
as
ever
to
the
admission
of
Red_China
to
the
United_Nations
.
Chen
was
equally
adamant
in
his
opposition
to
the
admission
of
Outer_Mongolia
;
however
the
President
,
who
would
like
to
woo
the
former
Chinese
province
away
from
both
Peking
and
Moscow
,
would
promise
Chen
nothing
more_than
an
abstention
by
the
U._S.
if
Outer_Mongolia
's
admission
comes
to
a
vote
.
The
President
also
conferred_with
emissaries
from
Guatemala
and
Nepal
who
are
seeking
more
foreign
aid
.
To
Africa
,
he
sent
his
most
trusted
adviser
,
his
brother
,
Attorney_General
Robert_Kennedy
,
on
a
good-will
mission
to
the
Ivory_Coast
.
All
week
long
the
President
clearly
was
playing
a
larger
personal
role
in
foreign
affairs
;
in_effect
,
he
was
practicing
what
he
preached
in
his
Berlin
message
two_weeks
ago
when
he
declared
:
``
We
shall
always
be
prepared
to
discuss
international
problems
with
any
and
all
nations
that
are
willing
to
talk
,
and
listen
,
with_reason
''
.
From
International_Airport
in
Los_Angeles
to
International_Airport
in
Houston
,
as
the
great
four-jet
Boeing
707
flies
,
is
a
routine
five
hours
and
25
minutes
,
including
stopovers
at
Phoenix
,
El_Paso
,
and
San_Antonio
.
When
Continental
Airlines
night-coach
Flight
54
took_off
at
11
:
30
one
night
last
week
,
there
was
no
reason
to
think
it
would
take
any
longer
.
The
plane
put_down
on
schedule
at
1
:
35
a.
m.
in
Phoenix
.
Thirty-one
minutes
later
,
when
it
took_off
for
El_Paso
,
hardly
anyone
of
the
crew
of
six
or
the
65
other
passengers
paid
any
attention
to
the
man
and
teen-age
boy
who
had
come
aboard
.
At
3
:
58
a.
m.
,
with
the
plane
about
twenty
minutes
out
of
El_Paso
,
passenger
Robert_Berry
,
a
San_Antonio
advertising
man
,
glanced
up
and
saw
the
man
and
boy
,
accompanied
by
a
stewardess
,
walking
up
the
aisle
toward
the
cockpit
.
``
The
man
was
bent_over
with
his
hand
on
his
stomach
''
,
Berry
said
.
``
I
figured
he
was
sick
''
.
John_Salvador
,
a
farmer
from
Palm_Desert
,
Calif.
,
was
sitting
up
front
and
could
see
through
the
door
as
the
trio
entered
the
cockpit
.
``
The
kid
had
a
.45
automatic
,
like
they
issue
in
the
Army
''
,
he
said
.
``
The
other
fellow
had
a
.38
''
.
Salvador
saw
the
youth
hold
his
.45
against
the
head
of
stewardess
Lois_Carnegey
;
the
man
put
his
.38
at
the
head
of
Capt._Byron_D._Rickards
.
To
Rickards
,
a
52
-
year-old
veteran
30
years
in_the_air
,
it
was
an
old
story
:
His
plane
was
being
hijacked
in
mid-flight
again
much_as
it
had
happened
in
1930
,
when
Peruvian
rebels
made
him
land
a
Ford
tri-motor
at
Arequipa
.
But
last
week
's
pirates
,
like
the
Cuban-American
who
recently
hijacked
an
Eastern
Airlines
Electra
(
Newsweek
,
Aug.
7
)
,
wanted
to
go
to
Havana
.
``
Tell
your
company
there
are
four
of
us
here
with
guns
''
,
the
elder
man
told
Rickards
.
The
pilot
radioed
El_Paso_International_Airport
with
just
that
message
.
But
,
he
told
the
``
skyjackers
''
,
the
707
did
n't
carry
enough
fuel
to
reach
Havana
;
they
would
have
to
refuel
at
El_Paso
.
Most
passengers
did
n't
know
what
had
happened
until
they
got
on
the
ground
.
Jerry_McCauley
of
Sacramento
,
Calif.
,
one
of
some
twenty
Air_Force
recruits
on_board
,
awoke
from
a
nap
in
confusion
.
``
The
old_man
came
from
the
front
of
the
plane
and
said
he
wanted
four
volunteers
to
go
to
Cuba
''
,
McCauley
said
,
``
and
like
a
nut
I
raised
my
hand
.
I
thought
he
was
the
Air_Force
recruiter
''
.
What
the
man
wanted
was
four
persons
to
volunteer
as
hostages
,
along
with
the
crew
.
They
chose
four
:
Jack_Casey
,
who
works
for
Continental
Airlines
in
Houston
;
Fred_Mullen
from
Mercer_Island
,
Wash.
;
Pfc._Truman_Cleveland
of
St._Augustine
.
Fla.
,
and
Leonard_Gilman
,
a
former
college
boxer
and
veteran
of
the
U._S._Immigration_Service
Border_Patrol
.
Everybody
else
was
allowed
to
file
off
the
plane
after
it
touched_down
at
El_Paso
at
4
:
18
a.
m.
.
They
found
a
large
welcoming
group
-
El_Paso
policemen
,
Border_Patrol
,
sheriff
's
deputies
,
and
FBI
men
,
who
surged
around
the
plane
with
rifles
and
submarine
guns
.
Other
FBI
men
,
talking
with
the
pilot
from
the
tower
,
conspired
with
him
to
delay
the
proposed
flight
to
Havana
.
The
ground_crew
,
which
ordinarily
fuels
a
707
in
twenty
minutes
,
took
fully
three
hours
.
Still
more
time
was
consumed
while
the
pilot
,
at
the
radioed
suggestion
of
Continental
president
Robert
Six
,
tried
to
persuade
the
armed
pair
to
swap
the
Boeing
jet
for
a
propeller-driven
Douglas_DC-7
.
Actually
,
the
officers
on_the_ground
had
no
intention
of
letting
the
hijackers
get_away
with
any
kind_of
an
airplane
;
they
had
orders
to_that_effect
straight
from
President_Kennedy
,
who
thought
at_first
,
as
did
most
others
,
that
it
was
four
followers
of
Cuba
's
Fidel_Castro
who
had
taken_over
the
707
.
Mr._Kennedy
had
been
informed
early
in
the
day
of
the
attempt
to
steal
the
plane
,
kept
in
touch
throughout
by
telephone
.
At_one_time
,
while
still
under
the
impression
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
Cuban
plot
,
the
President
talked_about
invoking
a
total
embargo
on
trade
with
Cuba
.
As
the
morning
wore_on
and
a
blazing
West_Texas
sun
wiped
the
shadows
off
the
Franklin
Mountains
,
police
got
close
enough
to
the
plane
to
pry
into
the
baggage
compartment
.
From
the
luggage
,
they
learned
that
the
two
air
pirates
,
far
from
being
Cubans
,
were
native_Americans
,
subsequently
identified
as
Leon_Bearden
,
50
-
year-old
ex-convict
from
Coolidge
,
Ariz.
,
and
his
son
,
Cody
,
16
,
a
high-school
junior
.
The
heat
and
strain
began
to
tell_on
the
Beardens
.
The
father
,
by_accident
or
perhaps
to
show
,
as
he
said
,
``
we
mean_business
''
,
took
the
.45
and
fired
a
slug
between
the
legs
of
Second
Officer_Norman_Simmons
.
At
7
:
30
a.
m.
,
more_than
three
hours
after
landing
,
the
Beardens
gave
an
ultimatum
:
Take_off
or
see
the
hostages
killed
.
The
tower
cleared
the
plane
for
take-off
at
8
a.
m.
,
and
Captain_Rickards
began
taxiing
toward
the
runway
.
Several
police_cars
,
loaded
with
armed
officers
,
raced
alongside
,
blazing_away
at
the
tires
of
the
big
jet
.
The
slugs
flattened
ten
tires
and
silenced
one
of
the
inboard
engines
;
the
plane
slowed
to
a
halt
.
Ambulances
,
baggage
trucks
,
and
cars
surrounded
it
.
The
day
wore_on
.
At
12
:
50
p.
m.
a
ramp
was
rolled
up
to
the
plane
.
A_few
minutes
later
,
FBI_agent
Francis_Crosby
,
talking
fast
,
eased_up
the
ramp
to
the
plane
,
unarmed
.
While
Crosby
distracted
the
Beardens
,
stewardesses
Carnegey
and
Toni_Besset
dropped
out
of
a
rear
door
.
So
did
hostages
Casey
,
Cleveland
,
and
Mullen
.
That
left
only
the
four
crew_members
,
Crosby
,
and
Border_Patrolman
Gilman
,
all
unarmed
,
with
the
Beardens
.
The
elder
Bearden
had
one
pistol
in
his
hand
,
the
other
in
a
hip_pocket
.
Gilman
started
talking
to
him
until
he
saw
his
chance
.
He
caught
officer
Simmons
'
eye
,
nodded
toward
young
Bearden
,
and
-
``
I
swung
my
right
as
hard
as
I
could
.
Simmons
and
Crosby
jumped
the
boy
and
it
was
all_over
''
.
Frog-marched
off
the
airplane
at
1
:
48
p.
m.
,
the
Beardens
were
held
in
bail
of
$
100000
each
on
charges
of
kidnapping
and
transporting
a
stolen
plane
across
state_lines
.
(
Bearden
reportedly
hoped
to
peddle
the
plane
to
Castro
,
and
live
high
in
Cuba
.
)
Back
home
in
Coolidge
,
Ariz.
,
his
36
-
year-old
wife
,
Mary
,
said
:
``
I
thought
they
were
going
to
Phoenix
to
look_for
jobs
''
.
Taking
precedence
over
all
other
legislation
on
Capitol_Hill
last
week
was
the
military
strength
of
the
nation
.
The
Senate
put
other
business
aside
as
it
moved
with
unaccustomed
speed
and
unanimity
to
pass
-
85
to
0
-
the
largest
peacetime
defense
budget
in
U._S.
history
.
With
the
money
all_but
in_hand
,
however
,
the
Administration
indicated
that
,
instead
of
the
225000
more
men
in
uniform
that
President_Kennedy
had
requested
,
the
armed_forces
would
be
increased
by
only
160000
.
The
``
hold-back
''
,
as
Pentagon
mutterers
labeled
it
,
apparently
was
a
temporary_expedient
intended
to
insure
that
the
army
services
are
built_up
gradually
and
,
thus
,
the
new
funds
spent
prudently
.
In_all
,
the
Senate
signed
a
check
for
$
46.7
billion
,
which
not_only
included
the
extra
$
3.5
billion
requested
the
week
before
by
President_Kennedy
,
but
tacked_on
$
754
million
more_than
the
President
had
asked
for
.
(
The
Senate
,
on
its
own
,
decided
to
provide
additional
B-52
and
other
long-range
bombers
for
the
Strategic_Air_Command
.
)
The
House
,
which
had
passed
its
smaller
appropriation
before
the
President
's
urgent
call
for
more
,
was
expected
to
go_along
with
the
increased
defense
budget
in_short_order
.
In
other
areas
,
Congressional
action
last
week
included
:
The
Senate
(
by
voice
vote
)
and
the
House
(
by
224
-
170
)
passed
and
sent
to
the
White_House
the
compromise
farm_bill
which
the
President
is
expected
to
sign
,
not
too
unhappily
.
The
Senate
also
voted
$
5.2
billion
to
finance
the
government
's
health
,
welfare
,
and
labor
activities
.
Debate
on
the
all-important
foreign-aid
bill
,
with
its
controversial
long-range
proposals
,
had
just
begun
on
the
Senate
floor
at
the
weekend
.
White_House
legislative
aides
were
still
confident
the
bill
would
pass
intact
.
Most
members
of
the
U._S._Senate
,
because
they
are
human
,
like
to
eat
as
high
on
the
hog
as
they
can
.
But
,
because
they
are
politicians
,
they
like
to
talk
as
poor-mouth
as
the
lowliest
voter
.
As
a
result
,
ever
since
1851
when
the
Senate
restaurant
opened
in
the
new
wing
of
the
Capitol_Building
,
the
senators
have
never
ceased
to
grumble
about
the
food
-
even
while
they
opposed
every
move
that
might
improve
it
.
Over
the
years
,
enlivened
chiefly
by
disputes
about
the
relative
merits
of
Maine
and
Idaho
potatoes
,
the
menu
has
pursued
its
drab
all-American
course
.
Individual
senators
,
with
an
eye
to
the
voters
back
home
,
occasionally
introduced
smelts
from
Michigan
,
soft-shell_crabs
from
Maryland
,
oysters
from
Washington
,
grapefruit
from
Florida
.
But
plain
old
bean
soup
,
served
daily
since
the
turn_of_the_century
(
at
the
insistence
of
the
late
Sen._Fred_Dubois
of
Idaho
)
,
made
clear
to
the
citizenry
that
the
Senate
's
stomach
was
in
the
right
place
.
In
a
daring
stroke
,
the
Senate
ventured
forth
last
week
into
the
world
of
haute
cuisine
and
hired
a
$
10000
-
per-year
French-born
maitre
d
'
hotel
.
