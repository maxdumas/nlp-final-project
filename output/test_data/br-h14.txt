From
its
inception
in
1920
with
the
passage
of
Public_Law
236
,
66_th_Congress
,
the
purpose
of
the
vocational
rehabilitation_program
has
been
to
assist
the
States
,
by
means
of
grants-in-aid
,
to
return
disabled
men
and
women
to
productive
,
gainful
employment
.
The
authority
for
the
program
was
renewed
several
times
until
the
vocational
rehabilitation_program
was
made
permanent
as
Title
5
,
of
the
Social_Security_Act
in
1935
.
Up
to
this
time
and
for
the
next
eight
years
,
the
services
provided
disabled
persons
consisted
mainly
of
training
,
counseling
,
and
placement
on
a
job
.
Recognizing
the
limitations
of
such
a
program
,
the
78_th_Congress
in
1943
passed
P._L.
113
,
which
broadened
the
concept
of
rehabilitation
to
include
the
provision
of
physical
restoration
services
to
remove
or
reduce
disabilities
,
and
which
revised
the
financing
structure
.
Despite
the
successful
rehabilitation
of
over
a
half
million
disabled
persons
in
the
first
eleven
years
after
1943
,
the
existing
program
was
still
seen
to
be
inadequate
to
cope_with
the
nation
's
backlog
of
an
estimated
two
million
disabled
.
To
assist
the
States
,
therefore
,
in
rehabilitating
handicapped
individuals
,
``
so
that
they
may
prepare
for
and
engage
in
remunerative
employment
to
the
extent
of
their
capabilities
''
,
the
83_rd_Congress
enacted
the
Vocational_Rehabilitation_Amendments_of_1954
(
P._L.
565
)
.
These
amendments
to
the
Vocational_Rehabilitation_Act
were
designed
to
help
provide_for
more
specialized
rehabilitation
facilities
,
for
more
sheltered
and
``
half-way
''
workshops
,
for
greater
numbers
of
adequately
trained
personnel
,
for
more
comprehensive
services
to
individuals
(
particularly
to
the
homebound
and
the
blind
)
,
and
for
other
administrative
improvements
to
increase
the
program
's
overall
effectiveness
.
Under
the
law
as
it
existed
until
1943
,
the
Federal_Government
made
grants
to
the
States
on
the
basis
of
population
,
matching
State
expenditures
on
a
50_-_50
basis
.
Under
P._L.
113
,
78_th_Congress
,
the
Federal_Government
assumed
responsibility
for
100
%
of
necessary
State
expenditures
in_connection_with
administration
and
the
counseling
and
placement
of
the
disabled
,
and
for
50
%
of
the
necessary
costs
of
providing
clients
with
rehabilitation
case
services
.
Throughout
these
years
,
the
statutory
authorization
was
for
such
sums
as
were
necessary
to
carry_out
the
provisions
of
the
Act
.
The
1954
Amendments
completely
changed
the
financing
of
the
vocational_rehabilitation_program
,
providing_for
a
three
part
grant
structure
-
for
(
1
)
basic
support
;
(
2
)
extension
and
improvement
;
and
(
3
)
research
,
demonstrations
,
training
and
traineeships
for
vocational_rehabilitation
-
and
in_addition
for
short-term
training
and
instruction
.
The
first
part
of
the
new
structure
-
that
for
supporting
the
basic
program
of
vocational_rehabilitation
services
-
is
described
in
this
Section
.
Subsequent
sections
on
grants
describe
the
other
categories
of
the
grant
structure
.
The
following
table
shows
,
for
selected
years
,
the
authorizations
,
appropriations
,
allotment
base
,
Federal
grants
to
States
and
State
matching_funds
for
this
part
of
the
grant
program
.
In_order
to
assist
the
States
in
maintaining
basic
vocational_rehabilitation
services
,
Section
2
of
the
amended
Act
provides
that
allotments
to
States
for
support
of
such
services
be
based
on
(
1
)
need
,
as
measured
by
a
State
's
population
,
and
(
2
)
fiscal
capacity
,
as
measured
by
its
per_capita
income
.
The
Act
further
provides
for
a
``
floor
''
or
minimum
allotment
,
set
at
the
1954
level
,
which
is
called
the
``
base
''
allotment
,
and
a
``
ceiling
''
or
maximum
allotment
,
for
each
State
.
It
stipulates
,
in_addition
,
that
all
amounts
remaining
as_a_result_of
imposing
the
``
ceiling
''
,
and
not
used
for
insuring
the
``
floor
''
,
be
redistributed
to
those
States
still
below
their
maximums
.
These
provisions
are
designed
to
reflect
the
differences
in
wealth
and
population
among
the
States
,
with
the
objective
that
a
vocationally
handicapped
person
have
access
to
needed
services
regardless
of
whether
he
resides
in
a
State
with
a
low
or
high
per_capita
income
or
a
sparsely
or
thickly
populated
State
.
The
provisions
are
also
designed
to
avoid
disruption
in
State
programs
already
in_operation
,
which
might
otherwise
result
from
the
allotment
of
funds
on
the
basis
of
wealth
and
population
alone
.
The
method
used
in
computing
the
allotments
is
specifically
set_forth
in
the
Act
.
The
term
``
State
''
means
the
several
States
,
the
District_of_Columbia
,
the
Virgin_Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto_Rico
;
the
term
``
United_States
''
includes
the
several
States
and
the
District_of_Columbia
,
and
excludes
the
Virgin_Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto_Rico
,
and
,
prior
to
1962
,
Alaska
and
Hawaii
.
The
following
steps
are
employed
in
calculations
:
For
each
State
(
except
Puerto_Rico
,
Guam
,
the
Virgin_Islands
,
and
,
prior
to
1962
,
Alaska
and
Hawaii
)
determine
average
per_capita
income
based_on
the
last
three
years
.
(
See
Source_of_Data
,
below
for
per_capita
income
data
to
be
used
in
this
step
.
)
Determine
the
average
per_capita
income
for
the
U._S.
based_on
the
last
three
years
.
(
See
Source
of
Data
,
below
,
for
per_capita
income
data
to
be
used
in
this
step
.
)
Determine
the
ratio
of
50
%
to
the
average
per_capita
income
of
the
U._S.
(
Divide
50
by
the
result
obtained
in
item
2
above
.
)
Determine
for
each
State
(
except
the
Virgin_Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto_Rico
,
and
,
prior
to
1962
,
Alaska
and
Hawaii
)
that
percentage
which
bears
the
same
ratio
to
50
%
as
the
particular
State
's
average
per_capita
income
bears
to
the
average
per_capita
income
of
the
U._S.
.
(
Multiply
the
result
obtained
in
item
3
above
by
the
result
obtained
for
each
State
in
item
1
above
.
)
Determine
the
particular
State
's
``
allotment
percentage
''
.
By
law
this
is
75
%
for
the
Virgin_Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto_Rico
.
(
Alaska
and
Hawaii
had
fixed
allotment
percentages
in_effect
prior
to
fiscal_year
1962
.
)
In
all
other
States
it
is
the
difference
obtained
by
subtracting
from
100
the
result
obtained
in
item
4
above
;
except
that
no
State
shall
have
an
allotment
percentage
less_than
33
-
1
3
%
nor
more_than
75
%
.
If
the
resulting
difference
for
the
particular
State
is
less
or
more_than
these
extremes
,
the
State
's
allotment
percentage
must
be
raised
or
lowered
to
the
appropriate
extreme
.
Square
each
State
's
allotment
percentage
.
Determine
each
State
's
population
.
(
See
Source
of
Data
,
below
for
population
data
to
be
used
in
this
step
.
)
Multiply
the
population
of
each
State
by
the
square
of
its
allotment
percentage
.
(
Multiply
result
obtained
in
item
7
above
,
by
result
obtained
in
item
6
above
.
)
Determine
the
sum
of
the
products
obtained
in
item
8
above
,
for
all
the
States
.
(
For
each
State
,
make
all
computations
set_forth
in
items
1
to
8
above
,
and_then
add
the
results
obtained
for
each
State
in
item
8
.
)
Determine
the
ratio
that
the
amount
being
allotted
is
to
the
sum
of
the
products
for
all
the
States
.
(
Divide
the
amount
being
allotted
by
the
result
obtained
in
item
9
above
.
)
Determine
the
particular
State
's
unadjusted
allotment
for
the
particular
fiscal_year
.
(
Multiply
the
State
product
in
item
8
above
by
the
result
obtained
in
item
10
above
.
)
Determine
if
the
particular
State
's
unadjusted
allotment
(
result
obtained
in
item
11
above
)
is
greater
than
its
maximum
allotment
,
and
if
so
lower
its
unadjusted
allotment
to
its
maximum
allotment
.
(
Each
State
's
unadjusted
allotment
for
any
fiscal_year
,
which
exceeds
its
minimum
allotment
described
in
item
13
below
by
a
percentage
greater
than
one
and
one-half
times
the
percentage
by
which
the
sum
being
allotted
exceeds
$
23000000
,
must
be
reduced
by
the
amount
of
the
excess
.
)
Determine
if
the
particular
State
's
unadjusted
allotment
(
result
obtained
in
item
11
above
)
is
less_than
its
minimum
(
base
)
allotment
,
and
if
so
raise
its
unadjusted
allotment
to
its
minimum
allotment
.
Regardless
of
its
unadjusted
allotment
,
each
State
is
guaranteed
by
law
a
minimum
allotment
each_year
equal
to
the
allotment
which
it
received
in
fiscal_year
1954
-
increased
by
a
uniform
percentage
of
5.4865771
which
brings
total
1954
allotments
to
all
States
up
to
$
23000000
.
The
funds
recouped
by
reductions
in
item
12
above
are
used
:
first
,
to
increase
the
unadjusted
allotments
to
the
specified
minimum
in
those
States
where
the
unadjusted
allotment
is
less
than
the
minimum
allotment
(
item
13
above
)
;
and
second
,
to
increase
uniformly
the
allotments
to
those
States
whose
allotments
are
below
their
maximums
,
with
adjustments
to
prevent
the
allotment
of
any
State
from
thereby
exceeding
its
maximum
.
For
the
States
which
maintain
two
separate
agencies
-
one
for
the
vocational
rehabilitation
of
the
blind
,
and
one
for
the
rehabilitation
of
persons
other_than
the
blind
-
the
Act
specifies
that
their
minimum
(
base
)
allotment
shall
be
divided
between
the
two
agencies
in
the
same
proportion
as
it
was
divided
in
fiscal_year
1954
.
Funds
allotted
in_addition
to
their
minimum
allotment
are
apportioned
to
the
two
agencies
as
they
may
determine
.
As
is
the
case
with
the
allotment
provisions
for
support
of
vocational
rehabilitation
services
,
the
matching
requirements
are
also
based
on
a
statutory
formula
.
Prior
to
1960
,
in_order
to
provide
matching
for
the
minimum
(
base
)
allotment
,
State
funds
had
to
equal
1954
State
funds
.
Prior
to
and
since
1960
the
rest
of
the
support
allotment
is
matched
at
rates
related_to
the
fiscal
capacity
of
the
State
,
with
a
pivot
of
40
%
State
(
or
60
%
Federal
)
participation
in
total
program
costs
.
The
percentage
of
Federal
participation
in
such
costs
for
any
State
is
referred
to
in
the
law
as
that
State
's
``
Federal
share
''
.
For
purposes
of
this
explanation
,
this
percentage
is
referred
to
as
the
States
``
unadjusted
Federal
share
''
.
Beginning
in
1960
,
the
matching
requirements
for
the
base
allotment
are
being
adjusted
(
upward
or
downward
,
as_required
)
25
%
a_year
,
so
that
by
1963
the
entire
support
allotment
will
be
matched
on
the
basis
of
a
40
%
pivot
State
share
,
with
maximum
and
minimum
State
shares
of
50
%
and
30
%
,
respectively
.
The
pre
1960
rate
of
Federal
participation
with_respect_to
any
State
's
base
allotment
,
as_well_as
the
adjusted
rate
in_effect
during
the
1960
-
1962
period
,
is
designated
by
the
statute
as
that
State
's
``
adjusted
Federal
Share
''
.
The
provisions
for
determining
a
State
's
unadjusted
Federal
share
are
designed
to
reflect
the
varying
financial
resources
among
the
States
.
The
purpose
of
the
adjusted
Federal
share
relating
to
the
base
allotment
and
of
the
transition
provisions
for
reaching
the
unadjusted
Federal
share
is
to
prevent
dislocations
from
abrupt_changes
in
matching
rates
.
The
method
used
for
computing
the
respective
Federal
and
State
shares
in
total
program
costs
is
specifically
set_forth
in
the
Act
.
The
term
``
State
''
means
the
several
States
,
the
District_of_Columbia
,
the
Virgin_Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto_Rico
;
the
term
``
United_States
''
includes
the
several
States
and
the
District_of_Columbia
and
excludes
the
Virgin_Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto_Rico
,
and
,
prior
to
1962
,
Alaska
and
Hawaii
.
The
following
steps
are
employed
in
the
calculations
:
For
each
State
(
except
the
Virgin_Islands
,
Guam
,
Puerto_Rico
,
and
,
prior
to
1962
,
Alaska
and
Hawaii
)
,
determine
the
average
per_capita
income
for
the
last
three
years
.
(
the
same
amount
used
in
item
1
under
Method
of
Computing
allotments
,
above
.
)
Determine
the
average
per_capita
income
for
the
United_States
for
the
last
three
years
.
(
The
same
amount
used
in
item
2
under
Method
of
Computing
Allotments
,
above
.
)
Determine
the
ratio
of
40
%
to
the
average
per_capita
income
of
the
United_States
.
(
Divide
40
by
the
amount
used
in
item
2
above
.
)
Determine
for
each
State
(
except
the
Virgin_Islands
,
Guam
,
Puerto_Rico
,
and
,
prior
to
1962
,
Alaska
and
hawaii
)
,
that
percentage
which
bears
the
same
ratio
to
40
%
as
the
particular
State
's
average
per_capita
income
bears
to
the
average
per_capita
income
of
the
United_States
.
(
Multiply
the
result
obtained
in
item
3
above
by
the
amount
used
for
each
State
in
item
1
above
.
)
Determine
the
particular
State
's
``
Federal
Share
''
.
By
law
this
is
70
%
for
the
Virgin_Islands
,
Guam
and
Puerto_Rico
.
(
Alaska
and
Hawaii
had
fixed
Federal
share
percentages
in_effect
prior
to
fiscal_year
1962
.
)
In
all
other
States
it
is
the
difference
obtained
by
subtracting
from
100
the
result
obtained
in
item
4
above
;
except
that
no
State
shall
have
a
Federal
share
less_than
50
%
nor
more_than
70
%
.
If
the
resulting
difference
for
the
particular
State
is
less
or
more_than
these
extremes
,
the
State
's
Federal
share
must
be
raised
or
lowered
to
the
appropriate
extreme
.
