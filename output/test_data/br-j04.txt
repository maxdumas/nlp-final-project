A
proton_magnetic_resonance
study
of
polycrystalline
**f
as
a
function
of
magnetic_field
and
temperature
is
presented
.
**f
is
paramagnetic
,
and
electron
paramagnetic
dipole
as_well_as
nuclear
dipole
effects
lead
to
line
broadening
.
The
lines
are
asymmetric
and
over
the
range
of
field
**f
gauss
and
temperature
**f
the
asymmetry
increases
with
increasing
**f
and
decreasing
T
.
An
isotropic
resonance
shift
of
**f
to
lower
applied
fields
indicates
a
weak
isotropic
hyperfine
contact
interaction
.
The
general
theory
of
resonance
shifts
is
used
to
derive
a
general
expression
for
the
second_moment
**f
of
a
polycrystalline
paramagnetic
sample
and
is
specialized
to
**f
.
The
theory
predicts
a
linear
dependence
of
**f
on
**f
,
where
|j
is
the
experimentally
determined
Curie-Weiss
constant
.
The
experimental
second_moment
**f
conforms_to
the
relation
**f
in_agreement
with
theory
.
Hence
,
the
electron
paramagnetic
effects
(
slope
)
can
be
separated
from
the
nuclear
effects
(
intercept
)
.
The
paramagnetic
dipole
effects
provide
some
information
on
the
particle
shapes
.
The
nuclear
dipole
effects
provide
some
information
on
the
motions
of
the
hydrogen
nuclei
,
but
the
symmetry
of
the
**f
bond
in
**f
remains
in
doubt
.
The
magnetic_moment
of
an
unpaired
electron
associated
nearby
may
have
a
tremendous
influence
on
the
magnetic_resonance
properties
of
nuclei
.
It
is
important
to
consider
and
experimentally
verify
this
influence
since
quantitative
nuclear_resonance
is
becoming
increasingly
used
in
investigations
of
structure
.
**f
appeared
to
be
well
suited
for
the
study
of
these
matters
,
since
it
is
a
normal
paramagnet
,
with
three
unpaired
electrons
on
the
chromium
,
its
crystal
structure
is
very
simple
,
and
the
unknown
position
of
the
hydrogen
in
the
strong
**f
bond
provides
structural
interest
.
We
first
discuss
the
**f
bond
in
**f
.
We
then
outline
the
theory
of
the
interaction
of
paramagnetic
dipoles
with
nuclei
and
show
that
the
theory
is
in
excellent
agreement
with
experiment
.
Indeed
it
is
possible
to
separate
electron
paramagnetic
from
nuclear
effects
.
The
information
provided
by
the
electron
paramagnetic
effects
is
then
discussed
,
and
finally
the
nuclear
effects
are
interpreted
in_terms_of
various
motional
modified
models
of
the
**f
bond
in
**f
.
Theoretical
studies
of
the
hydrogen_bond
generally
agree
that
the
**f
bond
will
be
linear
in
the
absence
of
peculiarities
of
packing
in
the
solid
.
Moreover
,
it
will
be
asymmetric
until
a
certain
critical
**f
distance
is
reached
,
below
which
it
will
become
symmetric
.
There
is
ample
evidence
from
many
sources
that
the
**f
bond
in
**f
is
symmetric
.
The
**f
distance
in
**f
is
2.26
A
.
There
is
evidence
,
though
less
convincing
than
for
**f
,
that
the
**f
bond
in
nickel
dimethylglyoxime
is
symmetric
.
Here
the
**f
distance
is
2.44
A
.
A
number
of
semiempirical
estimates
by
various
workers
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
**f
bond
becomes
symmetric
when
the
**f
bond
length
is
about
2.4
to
2.5
A
,
but
aside
from
the
possible
example
of
nickel
dimethylglyoxime
there
have
been
no
convincing
reports
of
symmetric
**f
bonds
.
Douglass
has
studied
the
crystal
structure
of
**f
by
x-ray_diffraction
.
He
finds
the
structure
contains
an
**f
bond
with
the
**f
distance
of
**f
.
There
is
,
then
,
the
possibility
that
this
**f
bond
is
symmetric
,
although
Douglass
was
unable
to
determine
its
symmetry
from
his
x-ray
data
.
Douglass
found
**f
to
be
trigonal
,
Laue
symmetry
**f
,
with
**f
,
**f
.
X-ray
and
experimental
density
showed
one
formula
unit
in
the
unit_cell
,
corresponding
to
a
paramagnetic
ion
density
of
**f
.
The
x-ray
data
did
not
permit
Douglass
to
determine
uniquely
the
space
group
,
but
a
negative
test
for
piezoelectricity
led
him
to
assume
a
center
of
symmetry
.
Under
this
assumption
the
space
group
must
be
**f
and
the
following
are
the
positions
of
the
atoms
in
the
unit_cell
.
**f
.
This
space
group
requires
the
hydrogen_bond
to
be
symmetric
.
Douglass
found
powder
intensity
calculations
and
measurements
to
agree
best
for
**f
.
These
data
lead
to
a
structure
in
which
sheets
of
Cr
atoms
lie
between
two
sheets
of
O
atoms
.
The
O
atoms
in
each
sheet
are
close_packed
and
each
Cr
atom
is
surrounded
by
a
distorted
octahedron
of
O
atoms
.
The
**f
layers
are
stacked
normal
to
the
[
111
]
axis
with
the
lower
oxygens
of
one
layer
directly
above
the
upper
oxygens
of
the
neighboring
lower
layer
,
in
such
a
manner
that
the
repeat
is
every
three
layers
.
The
separate
layers
are
joined
together
by
hydrogen_bonds
.
A
drawing
of
the
structure
is
to
be_found
in
reference
6
.
The
gross
details
of
the
structure
appear
reasonable
.
The
structure
appears
to
be
unique
among
ROOH
compounds
,
but
is
the
same
as
that
assumed
by
**f
.
The
bond
angles
and
distances
are
all
within
the
expected
limits
and
the
volume
per
oxygen
is
about
normal
.
However
,
the
possible
absence
of
a
center
of
symmetry
not_only
moves
the
hydrogen_atom
off
**f
,
but
also
allows
the
oxygen
atoms
to
become
nonequivalent
,
with
**f
at
**f
and
**f
at
**f
(
space
group
**f
)
,
where
**f
represents
the
oxygens
on
one
side
of
the
**f
layers
and
**f
those
on
the
other
side
.
However
,
any
oxygen
nonequivalence
would
shorten
either
the
already
extremely
short
**f
interlayer
distance
of
2.55
A
or
the
non
hydrogen_bonded
**f
interlayer
interactions
which
are
already
quite
short
at
2.58
A
.
Hence
it
is
difficult
to
conceive_of
a
packing
of
the
atoms
in
this
material
in
which
the
oxygen
atoms
are
far
from
geometrical
equivalence
.
The
only
effect
of
lack
of
a
center
would
then
be
to
release
the
hydrogen_atoms
to
occupy
general
,
rather_than
special
,
positions
along
the
[
111
]
axis
.
If
the
**f
bond
is
linear
then
there
are
three
reasonable
positions
for
the
hydrogen_atoms
:
(
1
)
The
hydrogen_atoms
are
centered
and
hence
all
lie
on
a
sheet
midway
between
the
oxygen
sheets
;
(
2
)
all
hydrogen_atoms
lie
on
a
sheet
,
but
the
sheet
is
closer
to
one
oxygen
sheet
than
to
the
other
;
(
3
)
hydrogen_atoms
are
asymmetrically
placed
,
either
randomly
or
in
an
ordered
way
,
so
that
some
hydrogen_atoms
are
closer
to
the
upper
oxygen
atoms
while
others
are
closer
to
the
lower
oxygen
atoms
.
Position
(
2
)
appears
to
us
to
be
unlikely
in_view_of
the
absence
of
a
piezoelectric_effect
and
on
general
chemical
structural
grounds
.
A
randomization
of
``
ups
''
and
``
downs
''
is
more
likely
than
ordered
``
ups
''
and
``
downs
''
in
position
(
3
)
since
the
hydrogen_atoms
are
well
separated
and
so
the
position
of
one
could
hardly
affect
the
position
of
another
,
and
also
since
ordered
``
up
''
and
``
down
''
implies
a
larger
unit_cell
,
for
which
no
evidence
exists
.
Therefore
,
the
only
unknown
structural
feature
would
appear
to
be
whether
the
hydrogen_atoms
are
located
symmetrically
(
1
)
or
asymmetrically
(
3
)
.
Douglass
prepared
his
sample
of
**f
by
thermal
decomposition
of
aqueous
chromic_acid
at
300
-
325
`
C
.
Dr._Douglass
was
kind
enough
to
lend
us
about
5
grams
of
his
material
.
This
material
proved
to
be
unsatisfactory
,
since
we
could
not
obtain
reproducible
results
on
various
portions
of
the
sample
.
Subsequently
,
we
learned
from
Douglass
that
his
sample
contained
a_few
percent
**f
impurity
.
Since
**f
is
ferromagnetic
,
we
felt
that
any
results
obtained
from
the
magnetically
contaminated
**f
would
be
suspect
.
Plane
suggested
another
preparation
of
**f
which
we
used
here
.
500
ml
of
1
M
aqueous
**f
with
1
g
**f
added
are
heated
in
a
bomb
at
170
`
C
for
48
hours
.
A
very
fine
,
gray
solid
(
about
15
g
)
is
formed
,
water-washed
by
centrifugation
,
and
dried
at
110
`
C
.
Differential
thermal
analysis
showed
a
very
small
endothermic_reaction
at
340
`
C
and
a
large
endothermic_reaction
at
470
`
C
.
This
latter
reaction
is
in_accord
with
the
reported
decomposition
of
**f
.
Thermogravimetric
analysis
showed
a
weight
loss
of
1.8
%
centered
at
337
`
C
and
another
weight
loss
of
10.8
%
at
463
`
C
.
The
expected
weight
loss
for
**f
going_to
**f
and
**f
is
10.6
%
.
Mass_spectrometric
analysis
of
gases
evolved
upon
heating
to
410
`
C
indicated
nitrogen_oxides
and
water_vapor
.
The
small
reaction
occurring
at
337
`
C
is
probably
caused
by
decomposition
of
occluded
nitrates
,
and
perhaps
by
a
small
amount
of
some
hydrous
material
other_than
**f
.
All
subsequent
measurements
were
made
on
material
which
had
been
heated
to
375
`
C
for
one
hour
.
Emission_spectra
indicated
**f
calcium
and
all
other
impurities
much
lower
.
Chromium
analysis
gave
58.8
%
Cr
as
compared
with
61.2
%
theory
.
However
,
**f
adsorbs
water
from
the
atmosphere
and
this
may
account_for
the
low
chromium
analysis
and
high
total
weight
loss
.
The
x-ray_diffraction
pattern
of
the
material
,
taken
with
CuKla
radiation
,
indicated
the
presence
of
no
extra
lines
and
was
in
good
agreement
with
the
pattern
of
Douglass
.
Magnetic
analyses
by
R._G._Meisenheimer
of
this
laboratory
indicated
no
ferromagnetic
impurities
.
**f
was
found
to
be
paramagnetic
with
three
unpaired
electron
per
chromium
atom
and
a
molecular
susceptibility
of
**f
,
where
**f
.
For
exactly
three
unpaired
electrons
the
coefficient
would
be
3.10
.
An
infrared_spectrum
,
obtained
by
H._A._Benesi
and
R._G._Snyder
of
this
laboratory
,
showed
bands
in
the
positions
found
by
Jones
.
Electron_microscopic
examination
of
the
**f
sample
showed
it
to
be
composed
of
nearly
isotropic
particles
about
0.3
lm
in
diameter
.
The
particles
appeared
rough
and
undoubtedly
the
single
crystal
domains
are
smaller
than
this
.
The
x-ray
data
are
consistent
with
particle
sizes
of
1000
A
or
greater
.
We
found
no
obvious
effects
due_to
preferred
orientation
of
the
crystallites
in
this
sample
nor
would
we
expect
to
on
the
basis
of
the
shape
found
from
electron_microscopic
examination
.
The
magnetic_resonance
absorption
was
detected
by
employing
a
Varian
model
**f
broad
line
spectrometer
and
the
associated
12
-
inch
electromagnet
system
.
One
measurement
at
40
Mc
/
sec
was
obtained
with
the
Varian
model
**f
unit
.
A
bridged-T
type
of
bridge
was
used
in
the
10
-
16
Mc
/
sec
range
.
The
rf
power
level
was
maintained
small
enough
at
all
times
to
prevent
obvious
line
shape
distortions
by
saturation
effects
.
A
modulation
frequency
of
40
cps
with
an
amplitude
as
small
as
possible
,
commensurate
with
reasonably
good
signal-to-noise
quality
,
was
used
.
Background
spectra
were
obtained
in
all
cases
.
The
spectrometer
was
adjusted
to
minimize
the
amount
of
dispersion
mode
mixed_in
with
the
absorption
signal
.
A
single
value
of
the
thermal
relaxation_time
**f
at
room_temperature
was
measured
by
the
progressive
saturation
method
.
The
value
of
**f
estimated
at
470
gauss
was
**f
microseconds
.
A
single
measurement
of
the
spin
spin
relaxation_time
**f
was
obtained
at
10
Mc
/
sec
by
pulse
methods
.
This
measurement
was
obtained
by
W._Blumberg
of
the
University_of_California,Berkeley
,
by
observing
the
breadth
of
the
free
induction
decay
signal
.
The
value
derived
was
16
microseconds
.
Field
shifts
were
derived
from
the
mean
value
of
the
resonance
line
,
defined
as
the
field
about
which
the
first_moment
is
zero
.
Second_moments
of
the
spectra
were
computed
by
numerical
integration
.
Corrections
were
applied
for
modulation
broadening
,
apparatus
background
,
and
field
shift
.
Spectra
were
obtained
over
the
temperature
range
of
77
-
294
`
K
.
For
the
low-temperature
measurements
the
sample
was
cooled
by
a
cold
nitrogen
gas
flow
method
similar
to
that
of
Andrew
and
Eades
.
The
temperature
was
maintained
to
within
about
**f
for
the
period_of_time
required
to
make
the
measurement
(
usually
about
one
hour
)
.
One
sample
,
which
had
been
exposed
to
the
atmosphere
after
evacuation
at
375
`
C
,
showed
the
presence
of
adsorbed
water
(
about
0.3
wt
%
)
as
evidenced
by
a
weak
resonance
line
which
was
very
narrow
at
room_temperature
and
which
disappeared
,
due_to
broadening
,
at
low_temperature
.
The
data
reported
here
are
either
from
spectra
from
which
the
adsorbed
water
resonance
could
easily
be
eliminated
or
from
spectra
of
samples
evacuated
and
sealed_off
at
375
`
C
which
contain
no
adsorbed
water
.
The
measured
powder
density
of
the
**f
used
here
was
about
**f
,
approximately
one-third
that
of
the
crystal
density
(
**f
)
.
Such
a
density
corresponds
to
a
paramagnetic
ion
density
of
about
**f
.
Spectra
were
obtained
from
a
powdered
sample
having
the
shape
of
a
right
circular
cylinder
with
a
height
to
diameter
ratio
of
4
:
1
.
The
top
of
the
sample
was
nearly
flat
and
the
bottom
hemispherical
.
Spectra
were
also
obtained
from
a
sample
in
a
spherical
container
which
was
made
by
blowing
a
bubble
on
the
end
of
a
capillary
glass
tube
.
The
bubble
was
filled
to
the
top
and
special
precautions
were
taken
to
prevent
any
sample
from
remaining
in
the
capillary
.
Spectra
were
also
obtained
from
a
third
sample
of
**f
which
had
been
diluted
to
three_times
its
original
volume
with
powdered
,
anhydrous
alundum
(
**f
)
.
This
sample
was
contained
in
a
cylindrical
container
similar
to
that
described
above
.
