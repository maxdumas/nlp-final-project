Among
us
,
we
three
handled
quite
a
few
small
commissions
,
from
spot
drawings
for
advertising_agencies
uptown
to
magazine
work
and
quick
lettering
jobs
.
Each
of
us
had
his
own
specialty
besides
.
George
did
wonderful
complicated
pen-and-ink
drawings
like
something
out
of
a
medieval
miniature
:
hundreds
of
delicate
details
crammed
into
an
eight
by
ten
sheet
and
looking
as
if
they
had
been
done
under
a
jeweler's_glass
.
He
also
drew
precise
crisp
spots
,
which
he
sold
to
various
literary
and
artistic
journals
,
The
New_Yorker
,
for_instance
,
or
Esquire
.
I
did
book_jackets
and
covers
for
paperback
reprints
:
naked
girls
huddling
in
corners
of
dingy
furnished
rooms
while
at
the
doorway
,
daring
the
cops
to
take
him
,
is
the
guy
in
shirt_sleeves
clutching
a
revolver
.
The
book
could
be
The_Brothers_Karamazov
,
but
it
would
still
have
the
same
jacket
illustration
.
I
remember
once
I
did
a
jacket
for
Magpie_Press
;
the
book
was
a
fine
historical
novel
about
Edward_3
,
,
and
I
did
a
week
of
research
to
get
the
details
just_right
:
the
fifteenth
century
armor
,
furnishings
,
clothes
.
I
even
ferreted_out
the
materials
from
which
shields
were
made
-
linden
wood
covered
with
leather
-
so
I
'd
get
the
light
reflections
accurate
.
McKenzie
,
the
art_editor
,
took
one
look
at
my
finished
sketch
and
said
,
``
Nothing_doing
,
Rufus
.
In
the
first
place
,
it
's
static
;
in
the
second
place
,
it
does
n't
look
authentic
;
and
in
the
third
place
,
it
would
cost
a
fortune
to
reproduce
in_the_first_place
-
you
've
got
six
colors
there
including
gold
''
.
I
said
,
``
Mr._McKenzie
,
it
is
as
authentic
as
careful
research
can
make
it
''
.
He
said
,
``
That
may
be
,
but
it
is
n't
authentic
the
way
readers
think
.
They
know
from
their
researches
into
television
and
the
movies
that
knights
in
the
middle_ages
had
beautiful
flowing
haircuts
like
Little_Lord_Fauntleroy
,
and
only
the
villains
had
beards
.
And
girls
could
n't
have
dressed
like
that
-
it
is
n't
transparent
enough
''
.
In_the_end
,
I
did
the
same
old
picture
,
the
naked
girl
and
the
guy
in
the
doorway
,
only
I
put
a
Lord_Byron
shirt
on
the
guy
,
gave
him
a
sword
instead
of
a
pistol
,
and
painted
in
furniture
from
the
stills
of
a
costume
movie
.
McKenzie
was
as
happy_as_a_clam
.
``
That
's
authenticity
''
,
he
said
.
As
for
Donald
,
he
actually
sold
paintings
.
We
all
painted
in
our
spare_time
,
and
we
had
all
started
as
easel
painters
with
scholarships
,
but
he
was
the
only
one
of
us
who
made
any
regular
money
at
it
.
Not
much
;
he
sold
perhaps
three
or
four
a
year
,
and
usually
all
to
Joyce_Monmouth
or
her
friends
.
He
had
style
,
a
real
inner
vision
of
his
very
own
.
It
was
strange
stuff
-
it
reminded
me
of
the
pictures
of
a
child
,
but
a
child
who
has
never
played
with
other
kids
and
has
lived
all
its
life
with
adults
.
There
was
the
freshness
of
color
,
the
freedom
of
perception
,
the
lack
of
self-consciousness
,
but
with
a
twist
that
made
the
forms
leap
from
the
page
and
smack
you
in
the
eye
.
We
used
to
kid
him
by
saying
he
only
painted
that
way
because
he
was
so
nearsighted
.
It
may
have
been
true
for
all
I
know
,
because
his
glasses
were
like
the
bottoms
of
milk
bottles
,
but
it
did
n't
prevent
the
paintings
from
being
exciting
.
He
also
had
,
at_times
,
an
uncanny
absent-minded
air
like
a
sleepwalker
;
he
would
look
right
through
you
while
you
were
talking
to
him
,
and
if
you
said
,
``
For_Christ's_sake
,
Donald
,
you
've
got
Prussian_blue
all_over
your
shirt
''
,
he
would
smile
,
and
nod
,
and
an
hour
later
the
paint
would
be
all_over
his
pants
as_well
.
Mrs._Monmouth
thought_of
him
as
her
discovery
,
and
she
paid
two
to
three
hundred
dollars
for
a
painting
.
It
was
all
gravy
,
and
Donald
did
n't
need
much
to
live_on
;
none
of
us
did
.
We
shared
the
expenses
of
the
studio
,
and
we
all
lived
within
walking
distance
of
it
,
in
cheap
lodgings
of
one
kind
or
another
.
Attending
the
life_class
was
my
idea
-
or
rather
,
Askington
's
idea
,
but
I
was
ripe
for
it
,
and
the
other
two
would
n't
have
gone
if
I
had
n't
talked
them
into
it
.
I
wanted
to
paint
again
.
I
had
n't
done
a
serious
picture
in
almost
a
year
.
It
was
n't
just
the
pressure
of
work
,
although
that
was
the
excuse
I
often
used
,
even
to
myself
.
It
was
the
kind
of
work
I
was
doing
,
the
quality
of
the
ambition
it
awoke
in
me
,
that
kept
me
from
painting
.
I
kept
saying
,
``
If
I
could
just
build_up
a
reputation
for
myself
,
make
some
real
money
,
get_to
be
well_known
as
an
illustrator
-
like
Peter_Askington
,
for_instance
-
then
I
could
take
some
time_off
and
paint
''
.
Askington
was
a
kind
of
goal
I
set
myself
;
I
had
admired
him
long
before
I
talked
to
him
.
It
looked
to
me
as
though
he
had
everything
an
artist
could
want
,
joy
in
his
work
,
standing
in
the
profession
,
a
large
and
steady
income
.
The
night
we
first
met
,
at
one
of
Mrs._Monmouth
's
giant
parties
,
he
was
wearing
a
brown
cashmere
jacket
with
silver
buttons
and
a
soft
pink
Viyella
shirt
;
instead
of
a
necktie
he
wore
a
leather
bolo
drawn
through
a
golden
ring
in
which
was
set
a
lump
of
pale
pure
jade
.
This
set
his
tone
:
richness
of
texture
and
color
,
and
another
kind
of
richness
as_well
,
for
his
clothing
and
decorations
would
have
paid
the
Brush-off
's
rent
for
a
year
.
He
was
fifteen
years
older
than
I
-
forty
four
-
but
full
of
spring
and
sparkle
.
He
did
n't
look_like
what
I
thought_of
as
an
old_man
,
and
his
lively
and
erudite
speech
made
him
seem
even
younger
.
He
was
one
of
the
most
prominent
magazine
illustrators
in
America
;
you
saw
one
of
his
paintings
on
the
cover
of
one
or
another
of
the
slick
national
magazines
every_month
.
Life
had
included
him
in
its
``
Modern
American
Artists
''
series
and
had
photographed
him
at
his
studio
in
the
East_Sixties
;
the
corner
of
it
you
could
see
in
the
photograph
looked
as
though
it
ought
to
have
Velasquez
in
it
painting
the
royalty
of
Spain
.
I
had
a
long
talk
with
him
.
We
went_into
Mrs._Monmouth
's
library
,
which
had
low
bookshelves
all
along
the
walls
,
and
above
them
a
Modigliani
portrait
,
a
Jackson_Pollock
twelve
feet
long
,
and
a
gorgeous
Miro
with
a
yellow
background
,
that
looked_like
an
inscription
from
a
Martian
tomb
.
The
fireplace
had
tiles
made
for
Mrs._Monmouth
by
Picasso
himself
.
Like
certain
expensive
restaurants
,
just
sitting
there
gave
you
the
illusion
of
being
wealthy
yourself
.
In
the
course
of
our
talk
,
Askington
mentioned
that
he
spent
part
of
each_week
studying
.
``
By
yourself
''
?
I
asked
.
``
No
,
I
take
classes
with
different
people
''
,
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
've
reached
the
point
,
yet
,
where
I
can
say
I
know
everything
I
ought
to
know
about
the
craft
.
Besides
,
it
's
important
to
the
way
a
painter
thinks
that
he
should
move
in
a
certain
atmosphere
,
an
atmosphere
in
which
he
may
absorb
the
ideas
of
other
masters
,
as
Durer
went_to
Italy
to
meet
Bellini
and
Mantegna
''
.
He
made
a
circle
with
his
thumb
and
fingers
.
``
Painting
is
n't
this
big
,
you
know
.
It
does
n't
embrace
only
the
artist
,
alone
before
his
easel
.
It
is
as
large
as
all_of
art
,
interdependent
,
varied
,
multitudinous
''
.
He
threw
his
arms
wide
,
his
face
shining
.
``
The
artist
is
like
a
fragment
of
a
mosaic
-
no
,
he
is
more_than
that
,
a
virtuoso
performer
in
some
vast
philharmonic
.
One_of_these_days
,
I
'm
going
to
organize
a
gigantic
exhibition
that
will
span
everything
that
's
being
painted
these
days
,
from
extreme
abstract_expressionism
to
extreme
photorealism
,
and_then
you
'll
be
able
to
see
at
a
glance
how
much
artists
have
in_common
with
each
other
.
The
eye
is
all
,
inward
or
outward
.
Ah
,
what
a
title
for
the
exhibition
:
The
Eye
is
All
''
!
``
What
do
you
study
''
?
I
asked
.
I
was
fascinated
;
just
listening
to
him
made
me
feel
intelligent
.
``
I
'm
studying
anatomy
with
Burns
''
,
he
replied
.
``
Maybe
you
know
him
.
He
teaches
at
the
Manhattan_School_of_Art
''
.
I
nodded
.
I
had
studied
with
Burns
ten
years
before
,
during
the
scholarship
year
the
Manhattan
gave
me
,
along
with
the
five-hundred
dollar
prize
for
my
paintings
of
bums
on
Hudson_Street
.
Burns
and
I
had
not
loved
each
other
.
``
I
'm
also
studying
enameling
with
Hajime_Iijima
''
,
he
went_on
,
``
and
twice
a
week
I
go_to
a
life_class
taught
by
Pendleton
''
.
``
Osric_Pendleton
''
?
I
said
.
``
My
God
,
is
he
still
alive
?
He
must
be
a_million
years
old
.
I
went_to
a
retrospective
of
his
work
when
I
was
eighteen
,
and
I
thought
he
was
a
contemporary
of
Cezanne
's
''
.
``
Not
quite
''
.
Askington
laughed
.
``
He
's
about
sixty
,
now
.
Still
painting
,
still
a
kind
of
modern
impressionist
,
beautiful
canvases
of
mountains
and
farms
.
He
even
makes
the
city
look_like
one
of
Thoreau
's
hangouts
.
I
've
always
admired
him
,
and
when
I
heard
he
was
taking
a_few
pupils
,
I
went
to
him
and
joined
his
class
''
.
``
Yes
,
it
sounds
great
''
,
I
said
,
``
but
suppose
you
do
n't
think_of
yourself
as
an
impressionist
painter
''
?
``
You
're
missing
the
point
''
,
he
said
.
``
He
has
the
magical
eye
.
And
he
is
a
great
man
.
Contact
with
him
is
stimulating
.
And
that
's
the
trouble
with
so
many
artists
today
.
They
lack
stimulation
.
They
sit
alone
in
their
rooms
and
try
to
paint
,
and
only
succeed
in
isolating
themselves
still
farther
from
life
.
That
's
one
of
the
reasons
art
is
becoming
a
useless
occupation
.
In
the
Middle_Ages
,
in
the
Renaissance
,
right
up_to
the
early
nineteenth
century
,
the
painter
was
a
giant
in
the
world
.
He
was
an
artisan
,
a
man
who
studied
his
trade
and
developed
his
craftsmanship
the
way
a
goldsmith
or
a
wood_carver
did
.
He
filled
a
real
need
,
showing
society
what
it
looked_like
,
turning
it
inside_out
,
portraying
its
wars
and
its
leaders
,
its
ugliness
and
its
beauties
,
reflecting
its
profound
religious
impulses
.
He
was
a
propagandist
-
they
were
n't
afraid
of
the
word
,
then
-
satirist
,
nature
lover
,
philosopher
,
scientist
,
what
you
will
,
a
member
of
every
party
and
of
no
party
.
But
look_at
us
today
!
We
hold
safe
little
jobs
illustrating
tooth-paste
ads
or
the
salacious
incidents
in
trivial
novels
,
and
most_of
our
easel
painting
is
nothing
but
picking
the
fluff
out
of
the
navel
so
it
can
be
contemplated
in
greater
purity
.
A
bunch
of
amateur
dervishes
!
What
we
need
is
to
get_back
to
the
group
,
to
learning
and
apprenticeship
,
to
the
cafe
and
the
school
''
.
He
could
certainly
talk
.
The
upshot
of
the
evening
was
that
I
got
the
address
of
Pendleton
's
studio
-
or
rather
,
of
the
studio
in
which
he
gave
his
classes
,
for
he
did
n't
work
there
himself
-
and
joined
the
life_class
,
which
met
every
Tuesday
and
Thursday
from
ten
to
twelve
in
the
morning
.
It
was
an
awkward
hour
,
but
I
did
n't
have
to
punch
any
time_clock
,
and
it
only
meant
that
sometimes
I
had
to
stay
a_couple_of
hours
later
at
the
drawing_board
to
finish_up
a
job
.
After
a
short
time
,
both
George
and
Donald
joined
the
class
with
me
so
they
would
n't
feel
lonely
,
and
we
used_to
hang
a
sign
on
the
door
of
the
Brush-off
reading
``
out
to
work
''
.
It
was
mostly
for
the
benefit
of
the
mailman
,
because
hardly
anybody
else
ever
visited
us
.
In_a_way
,
Askington
was
right
.
``
Stimulating
''
was
the
word
for
it
.
I
do
n't
know
that
it
was
always
as
rewarding
as
I
had
expected
it
to
be
.
Partly
,
it
was
because
Pendleton
himself
was
n't
what
I
anticipated
.
I
had
come
prepared
to
worship
at
the
feet
of
this
classic
,
and
he
turned_out
to
be
a
rather
bitter
old_man
who
smelled
of
dead
cigars
.
No
,
that
is
n't
quite
fair
.
Actually
,
there
was
a_lot
of
force
in
him
,
which
is
why
I
kept_on
in
that
class
instead
of
quitting
after
a
week
.
