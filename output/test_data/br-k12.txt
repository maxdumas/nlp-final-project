She
was
a
child
too
much
a
part
of
her
environment
,
too
eager
to
grow
and
learn
and
experience
.
Once
,
they
were
at
Easthampton
for
the
summer
(
again
,
Fritzie
said
,
a
good
place
,
even
though
they
were
being
robbed
)
.
One
soft
evening
-
that
marvelous
sea
blessed
time
when
the
sun
's
departing
warmth
lingers
and
a
smell
of
spume
and
wrack
haunts
everything
-
Amy
had
picked
herself
off
the
floor
and
begun
to
walk
.
Fritzie
was
on
the
couch
reading
;
Laura
was
sitting
in
an
easy_chair
about
eight
feet
away
.
The
infant
,
in
white
terry-cloth
bathrobe
,
her
face
intense
and
purposeful
,
had
essayed
a_few
wobbly
steps
toward
her
father
.
``
Y'all
wanna
walk
-
walk
''
,
he
said
.
Then
,
gently
,
he
shoved
her
behind
toward
Laura
.
Amy
walked
-
making_it
halfway
across
the
cottage
floor
.
She
lost
not
a
second
,
picking
herself
up
and
continuing
her
pilgrimage
to
Laura
.
Then
Laura
took
her
gently
and
shoved
her
off
again
,
toward
Fritzie
:
Amy
did
not
laugh
-
this
was
work
,
concentration
,
achievement
.
In
a_few
minutes
she
was
making
the
ten
foot
hike
unaided
;
soon
she
was
parading
around
the
house
,
flaunting
her
new
skill
.
Some
liar
's
logic
,
a
wisp
of
optimism
as
fragile
as
the
scent
of
tropical
blossoms
that
came_through
the
window
(
a
euphoria
perhaps
engendered
by
the
pill
Fritzie
had
given
her
)
,
consoled
her
for
a
moment
.
Amy
had_to
be
safe
,
had_to
come_back
to
them
-
if
only
to
reap
that
share
of
life
's
experiences
that
were
her
due
,
if
only
to
give
her
parents
another
chance
to
do
better
by
her
.
Through
the
swathings
of
terror
,
she
jabbed
deceit
's
sharp
point
-
Amy
would
be
reborn
,
a
new
child
,
with
new
parents
,
living
under
new
circumstances
.
The
comfort
was
short-lived
,
yet
she
found
herself
returning
to
the
assurance
whenever
her
imagination
forced
images
on
her
too
awful
to
contemplate
without
the
prop
of
illusion
.
Gazing
at
her
husband
's
drugged
body
,
his
chest
rising
and
falling
in
mindless
rhythms
,
she
saw
the
grandeur
of
his
fictional
world
,
that
lush
garden
from
which
he
plucked
flowers
and
herbs
.
She
envied
him
.
She
admired
him
.
In
the
darkness
,
she
saw
him
stirring
.
He
seemed
to
be
muttering
,
his
voice
surprisingly
clear
.
``
Y'all
should
have
let
me
take
that
money
out
''
,
Andrus
said
.
``
'
Nother
minute
I
'd
have
been
fine
.
Y'all
should
have
let
me
do
it
''
.
Laura
touched
his
hand
.
``
Yes
,
I
know
,
Fritzie
.
I
should
have
''
.
The
heat
intensified
on
Tuesday
.
Southern_California
gasped
and
blinked
under
an
autumn
hot_spell
,
drier
,
more
enervating
,
more
laden
with
man
's
contrived
impurities
than
the
worst
days
of
the
summer
past
.
It
could
continue
this
way
,
hitting
106
and
more
in
the
Valley
,
Joe_McFeeley
knew
,
into
October
.
He
and
Irvin_Moll
were
sipping
coffee
at
the
breakfast
bar
.
Both
had
been
up
since
7
:
00
-
Irv
on
the
early
morning
watch
,
McFeeley
unable
to
sleep
during
his
four
hour
relief
.
The
night
before
,
they
had
telephoned
the
Andrus_maid
,
Selena_Masters
,
and
she
had
arrived
early
,
bursting
her
vigorous
presence
into
the
silent
house
with
an
assurance
that
amused
McFeeley
and
confounded
Moll
.
The
latter
,
thanking
her
for
the
coffee
,
had
winked
and
muttered
,
``
Sure_'_nuff
,
honey
''
.
Selena
was
the
wrong
woman
for
these
crudities
.
With
a
hard
eye
,
she
informed
Moll
:
``
Do
n't
sure_'_nuff
me
,
officer
.
I'm
honey
only
to
my
husband
,
understand
''
?
Sergeant_Moll
understood
.
The
maid
was
very
black
and
very
energetic
,
trim
in
a
yellow
pique
uniform
.
Her
speech
was
barren_of
southernisms
;
she
was
one
of
Eliot_Sparling
's
neutralized
minorities
,
adopting
the
rolling
R
's
and
constricted
vowels
of
Los_Angeles
.
Not
seeing
her
dark
intelligent
face
,
one
would
have
gauged
the
voice
as
that
of
a
Westwood_Village
matron
,
ten
years
out
of
Iowa
.
After
she
had
served
the
detectives
coffee
and
toast
(
they
politely
declined
eggs
,
uncomfortable
about
their
tenancy
)
,
she
settled_down
with
a
morning
newspaper
and
began
reading
the
stock_market
quotations
.
While
she
was
thus
engaged
,
McFeeley
questioned
her
about
her
whereabouts
the
previous
day
,
any
recollections
she
had
of
people
hanging_around
,
of
overcurious
delivery_boys
or
repairmen
,
of
strange
cars
cruising
the
neighborhood
.
She
answered
him
precisely
,
missing
not
a
beat
in
her
scrutiny
of
the
financial
reports
.
Selena_Masters
,
Joe
realized
,
was
her
own
woman
.
She
was
the
only
kind
of
Negro
Laura_Andrus
would
want
around
:
independent
,
unservile
,
probably
charging
double
what
ordinary
maids
did
for
housework
-
and
doubly
efficient
.
When
the
parents
emerged
from
the
bedroom
a_few
minutes
later
,
the
maid
greeted
them
quietly
.
``
I'm
awful
sorry
about
what
's
happened
''
,
Selena
said
.
``
Maybe
today
'll
be
a
good
news
day
''
.
She
charged
off
to
the
bedrooms
.
Moll
took
his
coffee
into
the
nursery
.
During
the
night
,
a
phone_company
technician
had
deadened
the
bells
and
installed
red
blinkers
on
the
phones
.
Someone
would
have_to
remain
in
the
office
continually
.
McFeeley
greeted
the
parents
,
then
studied
his
notebook
.
He
wanted
to
take
the
mother
to
headquarters
at_once
and
start
her
on
the
mug_file
.
``
Sleep
well
''
?
he
asked
.
Andrus
did
not
answer
him
.
His
face
was
bloated
with
drugging
,
redder
than
normal
.
The
woman
had
the
glassy
look
of
an
invalid
,
as
if
she
had
not
slept
at_all
.
``
Oh
-
we
managed
''
,
she
said
.
``
I'm
a_little
groggy
.
Did
anything
happen
during
the
night
''
?
``
Few
crank_calls
''
,
McFeeley
said
.
``
A_couple_of
tips
we
're
running_down
-
nothing
promising
.
We
can
expect
more
of
the
same
.
Too
bad
your
number
is
in
the
directory
''
.
``
Did
n't
occur
to
me
my
child
would
be
kidnaped
when
I
had
it
listed
''
,
Andrus
muttered
.
He
settled_on
the
sofa
with
his
coffee
,
warming
his
hands
on
the
cup
,
although
the
room
was
heavy
with
heat
.
The
three
had
little
to
say
to
each
other
.
The
previous
night
's
horror
-
the
absolute
failure
,
overcast
with
the
intrusions
of
the
press
,
had
left
them
all
with
a
wan
sense
of
uselessness
,
of
play-acting
.
Sipping
their
coffee
,
discussing
the
weather
,
the
day
's
shopping
,
Fritzie
's
commitments
at
the
network
(
all
of
which
he
would
cancel
)
,
they
avoided
the
radio
,
the
morning
TV
news_show
,
even
the
front
page
of
the
Santa_Luisa_Register
,
resting
on
the
kitchen
bar
.
Kidnapper
Spurns
Ransom
;
Amy
Still
Missing
.
Once
,
Andrus
walked
by
it
,
hastily
scanned
the
bold
black
headline
and
the
five
column
lead
of
the
article
(
by
Duane_Bosch
,
staff
correspondent
-
age
not
given
)
,
and
muttered
:
``
We
a
buncha
national
celebrities
''
.
McFeeley
told
the
parents
he
would
escort
them
to
police_headquarters
in
a
half
hour
.
Before
that
,
he
wanted
to
talk
to
the
neighbors
.
He
did
not
want_to
bring
the
Andruses
to
the
station_house
too
early
-
Rheinholdt
had
summoned
a
press_conference
,
and
he
did
n't
want
them
subjected
to
the
reporters
again
.
He
could
think_of
nothing
else
to
tell
them
:
no
assurances
,
no
hopeful
hints
at
great
discoveries
that
day
.
When
the
detective
left
,
Andrus
phoned
his
secretary
to
cancel
his
work
and
to
advise
the
network
to
get
a
substitute
director
for
his
current
project
.
Mrs._Andrus
was
talking
to
the
maid
,
arranging
for
her
to
come
in
every_day
,
instead
of
the
four
days
she
now
worked
.
Outside
,
only
a
handful
of
reporters
remained
.
The
bulk
of
the
press_corps
was
covering
Rheinholdt
's
conference
.
In_contrast
to
the
caravan
of
the
previous
night
,
there
were
only
four
cars
parked
across
the
street
.
Two
men
he
did
not
recognize
were
sipping
coffee
and
munching
sweet_rolls
.
He
did
not
see
Sparling
,
or
DeGroot
,
or
Ringel
,
or
any
of
the
feverish
crew
that
had
so
harassed
him
twelve
hours
ago
.
However
,
the
litter
remained
,
augmented
by
several
dozen
lunchroom
suppers
.
The
street_cleaner
had
not_yet
been
around
.
One
of
the
reporters
called
to
him
:
``
Anything
new
,
Lieutenant
''
?
And
he
ignored
him
,
skirting
the
parked
cars
and
walking
up
the
path
to
the
Skopas
house
.
When
McFeeley
was
halfway
to
the
door
,
the
proprietor
emerged
-
a
mountainous
,
dark
man
,
his
head
thick_with
resiny
black
hair
,
his
eyes
like
two
of
the
black_olives
he
imported
in
boatloads
.
McFeeley
identified
himself
.
The
master
of
the
house
,
his
nourished
face
unrevealing
,
consented
to
postpone
his
departure
a_few
minutes
to
talk
to
the
detective
.
Inside
,
as_soon_as
Mr._Skopas
had
disclosed
-
in
a
hoarse
whisper
-
the
detective
's
errand
,
his
family
gathered
in
a
huddle
,
forming
a
mass
of
dark
flesh
on
and
around
a
brocaded
sofa
which
stood
at
one
side
of
a
baroque
fireplace
.
Flanked
by
marble
urns
and
alabaster
lamps
,
they
seemed
to
be
posing
for
a
tribal
portrait
.
It
was
amazing
how
they
had
herded
together
for
protection
:
an
enormous
matriarch
in
a
quilted
silk
wrapper
,
rising
from
the
breakfast_table
;
a
gross
boy
in
his
teens
,
shuffling
in
from
the
kitchen
with
a
sandwich
in
his
hands
;
a
girl
in
her
twenties
,
fat
and
sullen
,
descending
the
marble
staircase
;
then
all
four
gathering
on
the
sofa
to
face
the
inquisitor
.
They
answered
him
in
monosyllables
,
nods
,
occasionally
muttering
in
Greek
to
one
another
,
awaiting
the
word
from
Papa
,
who
restlessly
cracked
his
knuckles
,
anxious
to
stuff
himself
into
his
white
Cadillac
and
burst
off
to
the
freeway
.
No
,
they
had
n't
seen
anyone
around
;
no
,
they
did
n't
know
the
Andrus
family
;
yes
,
they
had
read
about
the
case
;
yes
,
they
had
let
some
reporters
use
their
phone
,
but
they
would
no_longer
.
They
offered
no
opinions
,
volunteered
nothing
,
betrayed
no
emotions
.
Studying
them
,
McFeeley
could
not
help
make
comparison
with
the
Andrus
couple
.
The
Skopas
people
seemed
to
him
of
that
breed
of
human_beings
whose
insularity
frees
them
from
tragedy
.
He
imagined
they
were
the
kind
whose
tax_returns
were
never
examined
(
if
they
were
,
they
were
never
penalized
)
,
whose
children
had
no
unhappy
romances
,
whose
names
never
knew
scandal
.
The
equation
was
simple
:
wealth
brought
them
happiness
,
and
their
united
front
to
the
world
was
their
warning
that
they
meant
to
keep
everything
they
had
,
let
no_one
in
on
the
secrets
.
By
comparison
,
Fritzie
and
Laura_Andrus
were
quivering
fledglings
.
They
possessed
no
outer
fortifications
,
no
hard
shells
of
confidence
;
they
had
enough
difficulty
getting
from
day
to
day
,
let_alone
having
an
awful
crime
thrust
upon
them
.
Skopas
expressed
no
curiosity
over
the
case
,
offered
no
expression
of
sympathy
,
made
no
move
to
escort
McFeeley
to
the
door
.
All
four
remained
impacted
on
the
sofa
until
he
had
left
.
He
had
spoken_to
Mrs._Emerson
the
previous
day
.
There
remained
a
family
named
Kahler
,
owners
of
a
two
story
Tudor
style
house
on
the
south_side
of
the
Andrus
home
.
Their
names
had
not
come_up
in
any
discussions
with
Laura
,
and
he
had
no
idea
what
they
would
be
like
.
McFeeley
noted
the
immaculate
lawn
and
gardens
:
each
blade
of
grass
cropped
,
bright
and
firm
;
each
shrub
glazed
with
good_health
.
The
door
was
answered
by
a
slender
man
in
his
sixties
-
straight_backed
,
somewhat
clerical
in
manner
,
wearing
rimless
glasses
.
When
Joe
identified
himself
,
he
nodded
,
unsmiling
,
and
ushered
him
into
a
sedate
living_room
.
Mrs._Kahler
joined
them
.
She
had
a
dried-out
quality
-
a
gray
,
lean
woman
,
not
unattractive
.
Both
were
dressed
rather
formally
.
The
man
wore
a
vest
and
a
tie
,
the
woman
had_on
a
dark
green
dress
and
three
strands
of
pearls
.
``
Funny
thing
''
,
Mr._Kahler
said
,
when
they
were
seated
,
``
when
I
heard
you
ringing
,
I
figured
it
was
that
guy
down
the
block
,
Hausman
''
.
McFeeley
looked
puzzled
.
Kahler
continued
:
``
I
fixed
his
dog
the
other
day
and
I
guess
he
's
sore
,
so
I
expected
him
to
come
barging_in
''
.
Mr._Kahler
went_on
to
explain
how
Hausman
's
fox_terrier
had
been
``
making
''
in
his
flower_beds
.
The
dog
refused
to
be
scared_off
,
so
Kahler
had
purchased
some
small
firecrackers
.
He
would
lay
in
wait
in
the
garage
,
and
when
the
terrier
came
scratching
around
,
he
'd
let_fly
with
a
cherry_bomb
.
``
Scared
the
hell
out
of
him
''
,
Kahler
grinned
.
``
I
hit
him
in
the
ass
once
''
.
Both
grinned
at
the
detective
.
``
Finally
,
all
I
needed
was
to
throw
a
little
piece
of
red
wood
that
looked_like
a
firecracker
and
that
dumb
dog
would
run
ki-yi-ing
for
his
life
''
.
