Farming
is
confining
.
The
farmer
's
life
must
be
arranged
to
meet
the
demands
of
crops
and
livestock
.
Livestock
must
be
tended
every_day
,
routinely
.
A
slight
change
in
the
work
schedule
may
cut
the
production
of
cows
or
chickens
.
Even
if
there
are
no
livestock
,
the
farmer
cannot
leave
the
farm
for
long
periods
,
particularly
during
the
growing_season
.
The
worker
who
lives
on
a
farm
cannot
change
jobs
readily
.
He
cannot
leave
the
farm
to
take
work
in
another
locality
on
short
notice
;
such
a
move
may
mean
a
loss
of
capital
.
Hard
physical
labor
and
undesirable
hours
are
a
part
of
farm
life
.
The
farmer
must
get_up
early
,
and
,
at_times
,
work
late
at
night
.
Frequently
he
must
work
long
hours
in
the
hot
sun
or
cold
rain
.
No_matter
how
well
work
is
planned
,
bad_weather
or
unexpected
setbacks
can
cause
extra
work
that
must
be
caught_up
.
It
may
not
be
profitable
for
a
part-time
farmer
to
own
the
labor-saving
machinery
that
a
full-time
farmer
can
invest
in
profitably
.
Production
may
fall
far
below
expectations
.
Drought
,
hail
,
disease
,
and
insects
take
their
toll
of
crops
.
Sickness
or
loss
of
some
of
the
livestock
may
cut
into
the
owner
's
earnings
,
even
into
his
capital
.
Returns
for
money
and
labor
invested
may
be
small
even
in
a
good
year
.
The
high
cost
of
land
,
supplies
,
and
labor
make
it
difficult
to
farm
profitably
on
a
part-time
basis
.
Land
within
commuting
distance
of
a
growing
city
is
usually
high
in
price
,
higher
if
it
has
subdivision
possibilities
.
Part-time
farmers
generally
must
pay
higher
prices
for
supplies
than
full-time
farmers
because
they
buy
in
smaller
quantities
.
If
the
farm
is
in
an
industrial
area
where
wages
are
high
,
farm
labor
costs
will
also
be
high
.
A
part-time
farmer
needs
unusual
skill
to
get
as
high
production
per
hen
,
per
cow
,
or
per
acre
as
can
be
obtained
by
a
competent
full-time
farmer
.
It
will
frequently
be
uneconomical
for
him
to
own
the
most
up-to-date
equipment
.
He
may
have_to
depend_upon
custom
service
for
specialized
operations
,
such_as
spraying
or
threshing
,
and
for
these
,
he
may
have_to
wait
his
turn
.
There
will
be
losses
caused
by
emergencies
that
arise
while
he
is
away
at
his
off
farm
job
.
The
farm
may
be
an
additional
burden
if
the
main
job
is
lost
.
This
may
be
true
whether
the
farm
is
owned
or
rented
.
If
the
farm
is
rented
,
the
rent
must
be
paid
.
If
it
is
owned
,
taxes
must
be
paid
,
and
if
the
place
is
not
free_of
mortgage
,
there
will
be
interest
and
payments
on
the
principal
to
take_care
of
.
A
farm
provides
a
wholesome
and
healthful
environment
for
children
.
It
gives
them
room
to
play
and
plenty
of
fresh
air
.
The
children
can
do
chores
adapted
to
their
age
and
ability
.
Caring
for
a
calf
,
a
pig
,
or
some
chickens
develops
in
children
a
sense_of_responsibility
for
work
.
Part-time
farming
gives
a
measure
of
security
if
the
regular
job
is
lost
,
provided
the
farm
is
owned
free_of
debt
and
furnishes
enough
income
to
meet
fixed
expenses
and
minimum
living
costs
.
For
some
retired_persons
,
part-time
farming
is
a
good
way
to
supplement
retirement
income
.
It
is
particularly
suitable
for
those
who
need
to
work
or
exercise
out_of_doors
for
their
health
.
Generally
,
the
same
level
of
living
costs
less
in
the
country
than
in
the
city
.
The
savings
are
not
as
great
,
however
,
as
is
sometime
supposed
.
Usually
,
the
cost
of
food
and
shelter
will
be
somewhat
less
on
the
farm
and
the
cost
of
transportation
and
utilities
somewhat
more
.
Where
schools
,
fire
and
police
protection
,
and
similar
municipal
services
are
of
equal
quality
in
city
and
country
,
real_estate
taxes
are
usually
about
the
same
.
A
part-time
farmer
and
his
family
can
use
their
spare_time
profitably
.
Some
persons
consider
the
work
on
a
farm
recreational
.
For
some
white-collar
workers
it
is
a
welcome
change
from
the
regular
job
,
and
a
physical
conditioner
.
Part-time
farming
can
take
comparatively
little
land
,
labor
,
and
equipment
-
or
a
great_deal
.
It
depends_on
the
kind
and
the
scale
of
the
farming
operation
.
General
requirements
for
land
,
labor
,
and
equipment
are
discussed
below
.
Specific
requirements
for
each
of
various
types
of
enterprises
are
discussed
on
pages
8
to
14
.
Three
quarters
to
1
acre
of
good
land
is
enough
for
raising
fruits
and
vegetables
for
home
use
,
and
for
a
small
flock
of
chickens
,
a
cow
,
and
two
pigs
.
You
could
not
,
of_course
,
raise
feed
for
the
livestock
on
a
plot
this
small
.
If
you
want_to
raise
feed
or
carry_out
some
enterprise
on
a
larger
scale
,
you
'll
need
more
land
.
In
deciding
how
much
land
you
want
,
take_into_account
the
amount
you
'll
need
to
bring_in
the
income
you
expect
.
But
consider
also
how
much
you
and
your
family
can
keep_up
along
with
your
other
work
.
The
cost
of
land
and
the
prospects
for
appreciation
in
value
may
influence
your
decision
.
Some
part-time
farmers
buy
more
land
than
they
need
in
anticipation
of
suburban
development
.
This
is
a
highly
speculative
venture
.
Sometimes
a
desired
acreage
is
offered
only
as
part
of
a
larger
tract
.
When
surplus
land
is
not
expensive
to
buy
or
to
keep_up
,
it
is
usually
better
to
buy
it
than
to
buy
so
small
an
acreage
that
the
development
of
adjoining
properties
might
impair
the
residential
value
of
the
farm
.
If
you
have
a
year-round
,
full-time
job
you
can
n't
expect
to
grow
much
more
than
your
family
uses
-
unless
other
members
of
the
family
do
a
good_deal
of
the
work
or
you
hire
help
.
As
a
rule
,
part-time
farmers
hire
little
help
.
In
deciding
on
the
enterprises
to
be
managed
by
family
labor
,
compare
the
amount
of
labor
that
can
be
supplied
by
the
family
with
the
labor
needs
of
various
enterprises
listed
in
table
1
.
List
the
number
of
hours
the
family
can
be
expected
to
work
each_month
.
You
may
want
to
include
your
own
regular
vacation
period
if
you
have
one
.
Do
not
include
all
your
spare_time
or
all
your
family
's
spare_time
-
only
what
you
are
willing
to
use
for
farm
work
.
If
you
are
going_to
produce
for
home
use
only
,
you
will
need
only
hand_tools
.
You
will
probably
want
to
hire
someone
to
do
the
plowing
,
however
.
For
larger
plantings
,
you
'll
need
some
kind
of
power
for
plowing
,
harrowing
,
disking
,
and
cultivating
.
If
you
have
a
planting
of
half
an
acre
or
more
you
may
want
to
buy
a
small
garden
tractor
(
available
for
$
300
to
$
500
with
attachments
,
1960
prices
)
.
These
tractors
are
not
entirely
satisfactory
for
plowing
,
particularly
on
heavier
soils
,
so
you
may
still
want
to
hire
someone
to
do
the
plowing
.
Cost
of
power
and
machinery
is
often
a
serious
problem
to
the
small-scale
farmer
.
If
you
are
going_to
farm
for
extra
cash
income
on
a
part-time
basis
you
must
keep
in
mind
the
needed
machinery
investments
when
you
choose
among
farm
enterprises
.
You
can
keep
your
machinery
investment
down
by
buying
good
secondhand
machinery
,
by
sharing
the
cost
and
upkeep
of
machinery
with
a
neighbor
,
and
by
hiring
someone
with
machinery
to
do
certain
jobs
.
If
an
expensive
and
specialized
piece
of
machinery
is
needed
-
such_as
a
spray
rig
,
a
combine
,
or
a
binder
-
it
is
better
to
pay
someone
with
a
machine
to
do
the
work
.
Before
you
look_for
a
farm
you
'll
need_to
know
(

)
the
kind
and
scale
of
farming
you
want_to
undertake
;
and
(

)
whether
you
want_to
buy
or
rent
.
Information
on
pages
8
to
14
may
help
you
in
deciding
on
the
kind
and
scale
of
your
farming
venture
.
If
you
are
not
well
acquainted_with
the
area
in
which
you
wish_to
locate
,
or
if
you
are
not
sure
that
you
and
your
family
will
like
and
make
a
success
of
farming
,
usually
you
would
do
better
to
rent
a
place
for
a
year
or
two
before
you
buy
.
Discussed
below
are
some
of
the
main
things
to
look_for
when
you
select
a
part-time
farm
.
Choose
a
location
within
easy
commuting
distance
of
both
the
regular
job
and
other
employment
opportunities
.
Then
if
you
change
jobs
you
won
n't
necessarily
have_to
sell
the
farm
.
The
presence
of
alternative
job
opportunities
also
will
make
the
place
easier
to
sell
if
that
should
become
desirable
.
Obviously
the
farm
should
be
on
an
all
weather
road
.
If
you
grow
anything
to
sell
you
will
need
markets
nearby
.
If
you
plan
to
sell
fresh
vegetables
or
whole
milk
,
for_example
,
you
should
be
close
to
a
town
or
city
.
Look_for
a
farm
in
a
neighborhood
of
well-kept
homes
.
There
are
slums
in
the
country
as_well
as
in
the
city
.
Few
rural_areas
are
protected
by
zoning
.
A
tavern
,
filling_station
,
junk_yard
,
rendering
plant
,
or
some
other
business
may
go_up
near
enough
to
hurt
your
home
or
to
hurt
its
value
.
Check
on
the
schools
in
the
area
,
the
quality
of
teaching
,
and
the
provision
for
transportation
to
and
from
them
.
Find_out
whether
fire
protection
,
sewage_system
,
gas
,
water_mains
,
and
electrical
lines
are
available
in
the
locality
.
If
these
facilities
are
not
at
the
door
,
getting
them
may
cost
more_than
you
expect
.
You
may
have_to
provide
them
yourself
or
get_along
without
them
.
You
cannot
get_along
without
an
adequate
supply
of
pure
water
.
If
you
are
considering
a
part-time
farm
where
the
water
must
be
provided
by
a
well
,
find_out
if
there
is
a
good
well
on
the
farm
or
the
probable
cost
of
having
one
drilled
.
A
pond
may
provide
adequate
water
for
livestock
and
garden
.
Pond
water
can
be
filtered
for
human
use
,
but
most
part-time
farmers
would
not
want
to
go
to
so_much
trouble
.
The
following
amounts
of
water
are
needed
per
day
for
livestock
and
domestic
uses
.
Is
the
land
suited
to
the
crops
you
intend
to
raise
?
If
you
can
n't
tell
,
get
help
from
your
county
agricultural_agent
or
other
local
specialist
.
Soil
type
,
drainage
,
or
degree
of
slope
can
make
the
difference
between
good
crops
and
poor
ones
.
Small
areas
that
are
n't
right
for
a
certain
crop
may
lie
next
to
areas
that
are
well
suited
to
that
crop
.
Will
the
house
on
any
part-time
farm
you
are
considering
make
a
satisfactory
full-time
residence
?
How
much
will
it
cost
to
do
any
necessary
modernizing
and
redecorating
?
If
the
house
is
not
wired
adequately
for
electricity
or
if
plumbing
or
a
central_heating
system
must
be
installed
,
check_into
the
cost
of
making
these
improvements
.
Its
worth
as
a
place
to
live
.
The
value
of
the
products
you
can
raise
on
it
.
The
possibilities
of
selling
the
property
later_on
for
suburban
subdivision
.
Decide
first
what
the
place
is
worth
to
you
and
your
family
as
a
home
in
comparison
with
what
it
would
cost
to
live
in
town
.
Take_into_account
the
difference
in
city
and
county
taxes
,
insurance
rates
,
utility
rates
,
and
the
cost
of
travel
to
work
.
Next
,
estimate
the
value
of
possible
earnings
of
the
farm
.
To
do
this
,
set_up
a
plan
on_paper
for
operating
the
farm
.
List
the
kind
and
quantity
of
things
the
farm
can
be
expected
to
produce
in
an
average
year
.
Estimate
the
value
of
the
produce
at
normal
prices
.
The
total
is
the
probable
gross
income
from
farming
.
To
find
estimated
net
farm
income
,
subtract
estimated
annual
farming
expenditures
from
probable
gross
income
from
farming
.
Include
as
expenditures
an
allowance
for
depreciation
of
farm_buildings
and
equipment
.
Also
count
as
an
expense
a
charge
for
the
labor
to
be
contributed
by
the
family
.
It
may
be
hard
to
decide
what
this
labor
is
worth
,
but
charge
something
for
it
.
Otherwise
,
you
may
pay
too
much
for
the
farm
and
get
nothing
for
your
labor
.
To
figure
the
value
of
the
farm
in_terms_of
investment
income
,
divide
the
estimated
annual
net
farm
income
by
the
percentage
that
you
could
expect
to
get
in
interest
if
the
money
were
invested
in
some
other
way
.
