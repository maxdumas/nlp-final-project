To_what_extent
and
in_what
ways
did
Christianity
affect
the
United_States_of_America
in
the
nineteenth
century
?
How
far
and
in_what
fashion
did_it
modify
the
new
nation
which
was
emerging
in_the_midst
of
the
forces
shaping
the
revolutionary
age
?
To_what_extent
did_it
mould
the
morals
and
the
social
,
economic
,
and
political
life
and
institutions
of
the
country
?
A
complete
picture
is
impossible
-
partly
because
of
the
limitations
of
space
,
partly
because
for
millions
of
individuals
who
professed
allegiance
to
the
Christian
faith
data
are
unobtainable
.
Even
more
of
an
obstacle
is
the
difficulty
of
separating
the
influence
of
Christianity
from
other
factors
.
Although
a
complete
picture
cannot
be
given
,
we
can
indicate
some
aspects
of
life
into
which
the
Christian
faith
entered
as
at_least
one
creative
factor
.
At_times
we
can
say
that
it
was
the
major
factor
.
What
in
some
ways
was
the_most
important
aspect
was
the
impact
individually
on
the
millions
who
constituted
the
nation
.
As
we
have
seen
,
a
growing
proportion
,
although
in
1914
still
a
minority
,
were
members
of
churches
.
Presumably
those
who
did
not
have
a
formal
church
connexion
had
also
felt
the
influence
of
Christianity
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
.
Many_of
them
had
once
been
members
of
a
church
or
at_least
had
been
given
instruction
in
Christianity
but
for
one
or
another
reason
had
allowed
the
connexion
to
lapse
.
The
form
of
Christianity
to_which
they
were
exposed
was
for
some
the
Protestantism
of
the
older
stock
,
for
others
the
Protestantism
of
the
nineteenth-century
immigration
;
for
still
others
,
mostly
of
the
nineteenth-century
immigration
,
it
was
Roman_Catholicism
,
and
for
a
small
minority
it
was
Eastern_Orthodoxy
.
Upon
all_of
them
played
the
intellectual
,
social
,
political
,
and
economic
attitudes
,
institutions
,
and
customs
of
the
nation
.
Upon
most_of
these
Christianity
had
left
an
impress
and
through
them
had
had
a
share
in
making
the
individual
what
he
was
.
Yet
to
determine
precisely
to_what_extent
and
exactly
in_what
ways
any
individual
showed
the
effects
of
Christianity
would
be
impossible
.
At_best
only
an
approximation
could
be
arrived_at
.
To
generalize
for
the
entire
nation
would
be
absurd
.
For_instance
,
we
cannot
know
whether
even
for
church_members
the
degree
of
conformity
to
Christian
standards
of
morality
increased
or
declined
as
the
proportion
of
church_members
in
the
population
rose
.
The
temptation
is
to
say
that
,
as
the
percentage
of
church_members
mounted
,
the
degree
of
discipline
exercised
by
the
churches
lessened
and
the
trend
was
towards
conformity
to
the
general
level
.
Yet
this
cannot
be
proved
.
We
know
that
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
many
Protestant
congregations
took
positive
action
against
members
who
transgressed
the
ethical_codes
to_which
the
majority
subscribed
.
Thus
Baptist
churches
on
the
frontier
took
cognizance
of
charges
against
their
members
of
drunkenness
,
fighting
,
malicious_gossip
,
lying
,
cheating
,
sexual
irregularities
,
gambling
,
horse_racing
,
and
failure
to
pay
just
debts
.
If
guilty
,
the
offender
might
be
excluded
from
membership
.
As
church
membership
burgeoned
,
such
measures
faded
into
desuetude
.
But
whether
this
was
accompanied
by
a
general
lowering
of
the
moral
life
of
the
membership
we
do
not
know
.
What
we
can
attempt
with
some
hope
of
dependable
conclusions
is
to
point_out
the
manner
in_which
Christianity
entered
into
particular
aspects
of
the
life
of
the
nation
.
We
have
already
hinted
at
the
fashion
in_which
Christianity
contributed
to
education
and
so
to
intellectual
life
.
We
will
now
speak
of
the
ways
in_which
it
helped
shape
the
ideals
of
the
country
and
of
the
manner
in_which
it
stimulated
efforts
to
attain
those
ideals
through
reform_movements
,
through
programmes
for
bringing
the
collective
life
to
the
nation
to
conformity
to
Christian
standards
,
and
through
leaders
in
the
government
.
Throughout
the
nineteenth
century
Christianity
exerted
its
influence
on
American
society
as_a_whole
primarily
through
the
Protestantism
of
the
older
stock
.
By
the
end
of
the
century
the
Roman_Catholic_Church
was
beginning
to
make
itself
felt
,
mainly
through
such
institutions
as
hospitals
but
also
through
its
attitude
towards
organized
labour
.
In
the
twentieth
century
its
influence
grew
,
as
did
that
of
the
Protestantism
of
the
nineteenth-century
immigration
.
The
ideals
of
the
country
were
deeply
indebted
to
the
Protestantism
of
the
older
stock
.
Thus
``
America
''
,
the_most
widely
sung
of
the
patriotic
songs
,
was
written
by
a
New_England
Baptist
clergyman
,
Samuel_Francis_Smith
(
1808
-
1895
)
,
while
a
student
in
Andover_Theological_Seminary
.
With
its
zeal
for
liberty
and
its
dependence
on
God
it
breathed
the
spirit
which
had
been
nourished
on
the
Evangelical
revivals
.
The
great_seal
of
the
United_States
was
obviously
inspired
by
the
Christian
faith
.
Here
was
what
was
called
the
American_dream
,
namely
,
the
effort
to
build
a
structure
which
would
be
something
new
in
history
and
to
do
so
in
such
fashion
that
God
could
bless
it
.
Later
in
the
century
the
dream
again
found
expression
in
the
lines
of
Katherine_Lee_Bates
(
1859
-
1929
)
,
daughter
and
granddaughter
of
New_England
Congregational
ministers
,
in
her
widely
sung
hymn
,
written
in
1893
,
``
America
the
Beautiful
''
,
with
the
words
``
O
beautiful
for
pilgrim
feet
whose
stern
impassioned
stress
a
thoroughfare
for
freedom
beat
across
the
wilderness
.
America
,
America
,
God
mend
thy
every
flaw
,
confirm
thy
soul
in
self
control
,
thy
liberty
in
law
.
O
beautiful
for
patriot
dream
that
sees
beyond
the
years
thine
alabaster
cities
gleam
undimmed
by
human
tears
.
America
,
America
,
God
shed
His
grace
on
thee
,
and
crown
thy
good
with
brotherhood
from
sea
to
shining
sea
''
.
The
American_dream
was
compounded
of
many
strains
.
Some
were
clearly
of
Christian
origin
,
among
them
the
Great_Awakening
and
other
revivals
which
helped
to
make
Christian
liberty
,
Christian
equality
,
and
Christian
fraternity
the
passion
of
the
land
.
Some
have
seen
revivalism
and
the
search
for
Christian
perfection
as
the
fountain-head
of
the
American
hope
.
Here
,
too
,
must
be
placed
Unitarianism
and
,
less
obviously
from
Christian
inspiration
,
Emerson
,
Transcendentalism
,
and
the
idealism
of
Walt_Whitman
.
We
must
also
remember
those
who
reacted
against
the
dream
as
a
kind_of
myth
-
among
them
Melville
,
Hawthorne
,
and
Henry_James
the
elder
,
all_of
them
out
of
a
Christian
background
.
With
such
a
dream
arising
,
at_least
in_part
,
from
the
Protestant
heritage
of
the
United_States
and
built
into
the
foundations
of
the
nation
,
it
is
not
surprising
that
many
efforts
were
made
to
give
it
concrete
expression
.
A
number
were
in
the
nature
of
movements
to
relieve
or
remove
social
ills
.
Significantly
,
the
initiation
and
leadership
of
a
major
proportion
of
the
reform_movements
,
especially
those
in
the
first_half
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
came
from
men
and
women
of
New_England
birth
or
parentage
and
from
either
Trinitarian
or
Unitarian_Congregationalism
.
Several
of
the
movements
were
given
a
marked
impetus
by
revivalism
.
Quakers
,
some
from
New_England
,
had
a
larger
share
than
their
proportionate
numerical
strength
would
have
warranted
.
We
do_well
to
remind
ourselves
that
from
men
and
women
of
New_England
ancestry
also
issued
the
Church
of
Jesus_Christ
of
Latter
Day_Saints
,
the
Seventh_Day_Adventists
,
Christian_Science
,
the
American_Board
of
Commissioners
for
Foreign_Missions
,
the
American_Home_Missionary_Society
,
the
American_Bible_Society
,
and
New_England
theology
.
The
atmosphere
was
one
of
optimism
,
of
confidence
in
human
progress
,
and
of
a
determination
to
rid
the
world
of
its
ills
.
The
Hopkinsian
universal
disinterested
benevolence
,
although
holding
to
original_sin
and
the
doctrine
of
election
,
inspired
its
adherents
to
heroic
endeavours
for
others
,
looked_for
the
early
coming
of
the
Millennium
,
and
was
paralleled
by
the
confidence
in
man
's
ability
cherished
by
the
Unitarians
,
Emerson
,
and
the
Transcendentalists
.
We
should
recall
the
number
of
movements
for
the
service
of
mankind
which
arose
from
the
kindred
Evangelicalism
of
the_British
Isles
and
the
Pietism
of
the
Continent
of
Europe
-
among
them
prison
reform
,
anti-slavery
measures
,
legislation
for
the
alleviation
of
conditions
of
labour
,
the
Inner_Mission
,
and
the
Red_Cross
.
We
cannot
take
the
space
to
record
all
the
efforts
for
the
removal
or
alleviation
of
collective
ills
.
A_few
of
the
more
prominent
must
serve
as
examples
of_what
a
complete
listing
and
description
would
disclose
.
Several
were_born
in
the
early
decades
and
persisted
throughout
the
century
.
Others
were
ephemeral
.
Some
disappeared
with
the
attainment
of
their
purpose
.
Still
others
sprang_up
late
in
the
century
to
meet
conditions
which
arose
from
fresh
stages
of
the
revolutionary
age
.
The
movement
to
end
Negro
slavery
began
before
1815
and
mounted
after_that
year
until
,
as
a
result
of
the
Civil_War
,
emancipation
was
achieved
.
Long
before
1815
the
Christian
conscience
was
leading
some
to
declare
slavery
wrong
and
to
act
accordingly
.
For_example
,
in
1693
the
Philadelphia_Yearly
Meeting
of
Friends
declared
that
its
members
should
emancipate
their
slaves
and
in
1776
it
determined
to
exclude
from
membership
all
who
did
not
comply
.
In
the
latter
year
Samuel_Hopkins
,
from
whom
the
Hopkinsian
strain
of
New_England
theology
took
its
name
,
asked
the
Continental_Congress
to
abolish
slavery
.
As
we
have
seen
,
Methodism
early
took
a
stand
against
slavery
.
Beginning
at_least
as
far
back
as
1789
various
Baptist
bodies
condemned
slavery
.
After
1815
anti-slavery
sentiment
mounted
,
chiefly
among
Protestants
and
those
of
Protestant
background
of
the
older
stock
.
The
nineteenth-century
immigration
,
whether
Protestant
or
Roman_Catholic
,
was
not
so_much
concerned
,
for
very_few
if
any
among
them
held
slaves
:
they
were
mostly
in
the
Northern
states
where
slavery
had
disappeared
or
was
on
the
way
out
,
or
were
too
poverty-stricken
to
own
slaves
.
The
anti-slavery
movement
took_many_forms
.
Benjamin_Lundy
(
1789
-
1839
)
,
a
Quaker
,
was
a
pioneer
in
preparing
the
way
for
anti-slavery
societies
.
It
was
he
who
turned
the
attention
of
William_Lloyd_Garrison
(
1805
-
1879
)
to
the
subject
.
Garrison
,
Massachusetts
born
of
Nova_Scotian
parentage
,
was
by_temperament
and
conviction
a
reformer
.
Chiefly
remembered
because
of
his
incessant
advocacy
of
``
immediate
and
unconditional
abolition
''
,
he
also
espoused
a
great
variety
of
other
causes
-
among
them
women
's
rights
,
prohibition
,
and
justice
to
the
Indians
.
Incurably
optimistic
,
dogmatic
,
and
utterly
fearless
,
in
his
youth
a
devout
Baptist
,
in_spite_of
his
friendship
for
the
Quaker
poet
John_Greenleaf_Whittier
(
1807
-
1892
)
he
eventually
attacked
the
orthodox_churches
for
what
he
deemed
their
cowardly
compromising
on
the
slavery
issue
and
in
his
invariably
ardent
manner
was
emphatically
unorthodox
and
denied
the
plenary
inspiration
of
the
Bible
.
A
marked
impulse
came
to
the
anti-slavery
movement
through
the
Finney
revivals
.
Finney
himself
,
while
opposed
to
slavery
,
placed
his
chief
emphasis
on
evangelism
,
but
from
his
converts
issued
much
of
the
leadership
of
the
anti-slavery
campaign
.
Theodore_Dwight_Weld
(
1803
-
1895
)
was
especially
active
.
Weld
was
the
son
and
grandson
of
New_England
Congregational
ministers
.
As
a
youth
he
became
one
of
Finney
's
band
of
evangelists
and
gave
himself
to
winning
young_men
.
A
strong
temperance
advocate
,
through
the
influence
of
a
favorite
teacher
,
Charles_Stewart
,
another
Finney
convert
,
he
devoted
himself
to
the
anti-slavery
cause
.
A
group
of
young_men
influenced
by
him
enrolled
in
Lane_Theological_Seminary
and
had
to
leave
because
of
their
open
anti-slavery
position
.
The
majority
then
went_to
the
infant
Oberlin
.
They
and_others
employed
some
of
Finney
's
techniques
as
they
sought
to
win
adherents
to
the
cause
.
Weld
contributed
to
the
anti-slavery
convictions
of
such
men
as
Joshua_R._Giddings
and
Edwin_M._Stanton
,
enlisted
John_Quincy_Adams
,
and
helped
provide
ideas
which
underlay
Harriet_Beecher_Stowe
's
Uncle_Tom
's
Cabin
.
He
shunned
publicity
for
himself
and
sought
to
avoid
fame
.
Wendell_Phillips
(
1811
-
1884
)
,
from
a
prominent
Massachusetts
family
,
in
his
teens
was
converted
under
the
preaching
of
Lyman_Beecher
.
Although
he
later
broke_with
the
churches
because
he
believed
that
they
were
insufficiently
outspoken
against
social
evils
,
he
remained
a
devout
Christian
.
He
was
remembered
chiefly
for
his
fearless
advocacy
of
abolition
,
but
he
also
stood
for
equal
rights
for
women
,
for
opportunity
for
the
freedmen
,
and
for
prohibition
.
The
anti-slavery
movement
and
other
contemporary
reforms
and
philanthropies
were
given
leadership
and
financial
undergirding
by
Arthur_Tappan
(
1786
-
1865
)
and
his
younger
brother
,
Lewis_Tappan
(
1788
-
1873
)
.
