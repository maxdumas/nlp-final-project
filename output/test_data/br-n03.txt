The
sentry
was
not
dead
.
He
was
,
in_fact
,
showing
signs
of
reviving
.
He
had
been
carrying
an
Enfield
rifle
and
a
holstered
navy
cap-and-ball
pistol
.
A
bayonet
hung
in
a
belt
scabbard
.
He
was
partially
uniformed
in
a
cavalry
tunic
and
hat
.
Mike
stripped
these
from
him
and
donned
them
.
He
and
Dean
tied
and
gagged
the
man
,
using
his
belt
and
shirt
for
the
purpose
.
They
dragged
him
inside
the
building
.
Fiske
joined
them
,
unsteady
on
his
feet
.
Julia
,
seeing
the
bandage
,
rushed
to
him
.
``
You
are
hurt
''
!
she
breathed
.
``
I
never
felt
better
in
my
life
''
,
Fiske
blustered
.
He
turned
to
Susan
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
.
``
Thank_you
,
My
dear
''
,
he
said
.
``
You
are
very
brave
''
.
Mike
silenced
them
.
``
We
'll
talk
later
.
First
,
we
've
got_to
get_out
of
here
''
.
``
We
'll
grab
horses
''
,
Dean
said
.
``
The
main
bunch
is
outside
,
but
there
are
some
over
there
inside
the
wall
''
.
Mike
debated
it
,
trying
to
decide
whether
Fiske
was
strong
enough
to
ride
.
But
it
at_least
offered
him
a
chance
for
living
.
He
had
none
here
.
And
,
for
the
sake
of
Julia
and
Susan
,
it
had
to
be
tried
.
The
guerrilla
bivouac
remained
silent
.
Light
showed
in
the
orderly
room
across
the
parade_ground
.
Someone
evidently
was
on_duty
there
.
No_doubt
there
would
be
men
guarding
the
horses
.
About
a
dozen
animals
were
held
inside
the
stockade
,
as
best
Mike
could
make_out
in
the
moonlight
.
Evidently
this
was
a
precaution
so_that
mounts
would
be
available
in
an
emergency
.
He
handed
the
guard
's
rifle
to
Fiske
.
``
Dean
and
myself
will
try
to
cut
out
horses
to
ride
''
,
he
said
.
``
We
'll
stampede
the
rest
.
You
stay
with
the
ladies
.
All_of
you
be
ready
to
ride
hell
for
leather
''
.
He
added
,
``
If
this
does
n't
work_out
,
the
three
of
you
barricade
yourself
in
the
house
and
talk_terms
with
them
''
.
He
handed
the
bayonet
to
Dean
and
kept
the
pistol
.
Susan
halted
Dean
and
kissed
him
.
She
clung_to
him
,
talking
to
him
,
and
dabbing
at
her
eyes
.
Mike
turned_away
.
He
was
thinking
that
the
way
she
had
responded
to
his
own
kiss
had
n't
meant
what
he
had
believed
it
had
.
He
felt
unutterably
weary
.
Dean
turned
from
Susan
and
took
Julia_Fortune
in
his
arms
.
He
kissed
her
also
,
and
with
deep
tenderness
.
She
too
began
to
weep
.
He
released
her
and
joined
Mike
.
``
All_right
''
,
he
said
.
Mike
only
said
,
``
Later
''
.
``
Be
careful
,
McLish
''
!
Susan
said
fiercely
.
``
The
way
you
were
careful
''
?
he
snorted
.
``
Running_around
in
the
moonlight
almost
naked
and
slugging
a
man
with
a
rock
''
?
He
kept
going
.
He
wanted
no_more
sentimental
scenes
with
her
.
He
might
say
or
do
something
foolish
.
Something
all_of
them
would
regret
.
He
might
tell
her
how
sorry
a
spectacle
she
was
making
of
herself
,
pretending
to
be
blind_to
the
way
Julia_Fortune
had
taken
Dean
's
affections
from
her
.
And
using
him
,
Mike_McLish
,
as
a
sop
to
her
pride
.
He
handed
the
bayonet
to
Dean
and
kept
the
pistol
.
``
Stay
well
back
of
me
''
,
he
said
.
``
I
'm
going_to
walk
up
to
the
horses
,
bold
as
brass
,
pretending
I
'm
one
of
the
guerrillas
.
There
's
bound_to
be
someone
on_guard
,
but
the
hat
might
fool
them
long
enough
for
me
to
get
close
''
.
Holding
the
pistol
concealed
,
he
walked
to_the_rear
wall
of
the
stockade
.
It
was
pierced
by
a
wagon
gate
built
of
two
wings
.
One
wing
stood
open
.
Mike
passed_through
it
and
moved
toward
the
dark
mass
of
horses
.
They
were
tethered
,
army
style
,
on
stable
lines
.
A
voice
spoke
near-at-hand
.
``
Who
's
thet
''
?
Just
me
``
,
Mike
said
.
''
Is
that
you
,
Bill
``
?
He
located
his
man
.
The
guard
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
stockade
wall
just
out_of_reach
of
the
moonlight
.
Mike
kept
walking
and
got
within
arm
's
reach
before
the
man
became
suspicious
and
straightened
from
his
lax
slouch
.
Mike
struck
with
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
.
But
the
luck
that
had
been
running
their
way
left
him
.
The
guard
instinctively
parried
the
blow
with
his
rifle
.
He
tried
to
veer
the
rifle
around
to
fire
into
Mike
's
body
.
Mike
,
off
balance
,
managed
to
bat
the
muzzle
away
a
moment
before
it
exploded
.
The
bullet
went
wide
.
Mike
swung
the
pistol
in
a
savage
backlash
.
This
time
it
connected
solidly
on
the
man
's
temple
,
felling
him
.
The
explosion
of
the
rifle
had
crashed
against
the
walls
of
the
stockade
and
the
deep
echoes
were
still
rolling
in
the
hills
.
The
startled
horses
began
rearing
on
their
tethers
.
Dean
came
rushing
up
.
``
Are
you
hit
''
?
he
demanded
.
``
No
,
but
the
fat
's
in
the
fire
''
!
Mike
said
.
``
There
's
no
chance
now
of
all_of
us
getting_away
.
You
'll
have_to
try
it
alone
''
.
The
sentry
's
saddled
horse
stood
picketed
nearby
,
having
been
kept
handy
in_case
of
need
.
Mike
took
the
bayonet
from
Dean
's
hand
and
slashed
the
picket_line
.
``
Up
you
go
''
!
he
said
.
``
Ride
''
!
Dean
resisted
Mike
's
attempt
to
push
him
toward
the
horse
.
``
Why
not
you
''
?
he
protested
.
``
Dammit
''
!
Mike
said
frantically
.
``
You
're
lighter
than
me
.
It
's
our
only
chance
now
.
Try
to
find
these
Feds
.
The
rest
of
us
can
fort_up
in
the
house
and
hang_on
until
you
get_back
.
You
're
the
one
that
's
taking
the
big
chance
''
.
Dean
still
hesitated
,
but
Mike
lifted
him
almost
bodily
into
the
saddle
and
thrust
the
reins
in
his
hand
.
``
No
telling
how
good
this
horse
is
''
,
Mike
panted
.
``
Favor
him
and
save
something
in_case
you
hit
trouble
.
Watch
out
for
Apaches
when
it
comes
daylight
.
Take
the
pistol
.
You
might
need
it
.
We
'll
still
have
the
rifle
,
and
I
might
be
able
to
round_up
some
more
.
I
'll
stampede
the
rest
of
these
horses
so
they
can
n't
chase
you
''
.
Dean
leaned
from
the
saddle
and
gave
him
a
mighty
whack
on
the
back
.
``
McLish
''
,
he
said
as
he
kicked
the
horse
into
motion
,
``
I
'd
be
a
mighty
sad
man
if
we
never
met
again
''
.
Then
he
was
on
his
way
at
a
gallop
.
Mike
ran
down
the
line
,
slashing
picket
ropes
with
the
bayonet
.
He
lifted
a
screeching
war_whoop
.
That
touched_off
a
total
stampede
.
He
darted
inside
the
stockade
and
freed
the
horses
there
.
These
poured
through
the
gate
and
joined
the
flight
.
The
animals
thundered
away
into
the
moonlight
,
heading
for
the
ridges
.
The
guerrillas
were
swarming
from
their
bivouac
at
the
west_end
of
the
enclosure
.
``
'
Paches
''
!
Mike
yelled
.
``
They
're
stealin
'
the
stock
''
!
He
scuttled
in
shadow
along
the
east
wall
of
the
stockade
and_then
followed
the
south
wall
until
he
was
at_the_rear
of
the
two
frame
buildings
.
He
crouched
there
.
His
shout
had
been
taken_up
and
repeated
.
The
guerrillas
were
running
across
the
parade_ground
and
through
the
rear
gate
in
the
wake
of
the
departing
horses
.
All
were
carrying
guns
they
had
seized
up
,
but
they
were
half-clad
or
hardly
clad
at_all
.
Durkin
and
Calhoun
came
running
from
the
post
.
They
had
pistols
in
their
hands
.
They
bawled
questions
that
were
not
answered
in
the
uproar
.
They
followed
the
others
toward_the_east
gate
.
Beyond
the
stockade
rifles
began
to
explode
as
some
of
the
guerrillas
fired
at
shadows
that
they
imagined
were
Apaches
.
Mike
made
a
dash
to_the_rear
of
the
frame
buildings
.
He
crawled
beneath
the
two
supply
wagons
which
stood
between
the
buildings
and
peered
around
a
corner
.
The
area
was
deserted
.
A
man
was
standing
in_the_open
door
of
the
lighted
orderly
room
a_few
yards
to
Mike
's
left
,
but
he
,
too
,
suddenly
made_up_his_mind
and
went
racing
to
join
the
confused
activity
at
the
east
end
of
the
stockade
.
Mike
crawled
to
the
door
and
peered
in
.
The
orderly
room
seemed
to
be
deserted
.
A
lantern
hung
from
a
peg
,
giving
light
.
Ducking
inside
,
he
found
that
three
rifles
were
stacked
in
a
corner
.
A
brace
of
pistols
,
holstered
on
belts
,
hung
from
a
peg
,
along
with
ammunition
pouches
.
An
ammunition
case
stood
open
,
containing
canisters
which
contained
powder
cartridges
.
Mike
seized
a
blanket
from
a
pallet
in
a
corner
,
spread
it
on
the
floor
and
used
it
to
form
a
bag
in_which
he
placed
his
booty
.
Shouldering
the
load
he
peered
from
the
door
.
His
looting
of
the
orderly
room
had
taken
only
a
minute
or
two
and
the
vicinity
was
still
clear
of
guerrillas
.
He
looked
at
the
looming
hoods
of
the
supply
wagons
,
struck
by
a
new
inspiration
.
He
set
his
bundle
down
.
Snatching
the
lantern
from
its
peg
,
he
shattered
its
globe
with
a
blow
against
a
post
.
He
picked_up
the
powder
canister
and
ran_out
.
Bursting
paper
cartridges
,
he
scattered
powder
beneath
the
nearest
wagon
and
dumped
the
contents
of
the
canister
upon
it
.
He
shouldered
the
blanket
again
,
backed_off
,
and
tossed
the
lantern
with
its
open
wick
beneath
the
wagon
.
He
turned
and
raced
across
the
parade_ground
toward
the
rock
house
.
Powder
flame
gushed
beneath
the
wagon
.
The
stockade
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
guerrillas
sighted
him
.
They
realized
the
truth
.
Bullets
began
to
snap
past
him
.
One
struck
the
muzzle
of
one
of
the
rifles
that
projected
from
the
shoulder
pack
.
Its
force
spun
him
around
,
but
he
recovered
and
got
into
stride
again
.
A
bullet
tore
the
earth
from
beneath
his
foot
when
he
was
a
stride
or
two
from
safety
.
Another
struck
him
heavily
in
the
thigh
and
he
went_down
.
Guerrillas
were
racing
toward
him
.
Susan
and
Julia
came
from
the
door
and
dragged
him
with
them
.
The
three
of
them
floundered
through
the
door
into_the_interior
and
fell
in
a
heap
.
Susan
bounced
to
her
feet
and
slammed
the
door
.
She
crouched
aside
as
bullets
beat
at
the
portal
,
chewing
into
the
planks
.
Some
tore
entirely
through
the
whipsawed
post_oak
.
The
iron
hinges
held
,
but
the
planks
were
in
danger
of
being
torn
from
the
crossbars
.
mike
rolled
to
Susan
,
grasped
her
around
the
knees
,
dragging
her
off
her
feet
.
He
hovered
over
her
to
shield
her
,
for
spent
bullets
were
thudding
against
the
rear
walls
.
He
peered
from
a
loophole
.
Guerrillas
were
only
a
dozen
yards
away
,
charging
the
house
.
Mike
snatched
a
pistol
from
the
heap
of
scattered
booty
and
fired
.
He
dropped
a
man
with
the
first
bullet
.
At
the
same
moment
Wheeler_Fiske
fired
the
rifle
Mike
had
given
him
and
another
guerrilla
was
hit
.
That
halted
the
rush
.
The
guerrillas
scattered
for
cover
.
The
wagons
were
burning
fiercely
.
The
mudwagon
had
caught_fire
also
.
The
blaze
was
spreading
to
the
frame
buildings
.
The
guerrillas
realized
they
faced
a
new
problem
.
``
Gawdamighty
''
!
one
screeched
.
``
There
goes
our
grub
an
'
ammunition
''
!
``
Get
a
bucket
line
going
''
!
Calhoun
shouted
.
``
Hurry
!
Hurry
''
!
The
guerrillas
began
a
frantic
search
for
pails
in_which
to
bring
water
from
the
spring
.
But
what
few
containers
they
found
were
inadequate
.
Many_of
them
,
in
increasing
panic
,
came
running
with
water
in
their
hats
in
a
ludicrous
effort
.
Both
buildings
were
in_flames
.
The
heat
drove
the
guerrillas
back
.
The
roof
of
the
command_post
began
to
buckle
.
``
Drag
the
wagons
to
the
spring
''
!
Lew_Durkin
yelled
.
``
Run
'
em
right
into
the
spring
!
Hustle
''
!
One
of
the
wagons
erupted
a
massive
pillar
of
flame
.
A
sizable
supply
of
powder
had
been
touched_off
.
The
wagons
and
the
coach
were
beyond
saving
and
so
were
the
buildings
.
The
glow
of
the
fire
reached
through
the
openings
in
the
windows
,
giving
light
enough
to
examine
Mike
's
wound
.
The
bullet
had
torn
through
the
flesh
just
above
the
knee
,
inflicting
an
ugly
gash
that
was
forming
a
pool
of
blood
on
the
floor
.
But
it
had
missed
the
bone
and
had
passed
on
through
.
Susan
and
Julia
ripped
strips
from
their
clothing
and
bound
the
injury
.
Mike
tested
the
leg
and
found
that
he
was
able
to
hobble
around
on_it
.
