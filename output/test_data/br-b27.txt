It
seems
to
me
that
N._C.
,
in
his
editorial
``
Confrontation
''
[
SR
,
Mar.
25
]
,
has
hit
upon
the
real
problem
that
bothers
all_of
us
in
a
complex
world
:
how
do
we
retain
our
personal
relationship
with
those
who
suffer
?
This
affects
us
all
intimately
,
and
can
leave
us
hopeless
in
the
face
of
widespread
distress
.
I
know
of
no
other
solution
than
the
one
N._C.
proposes
-
to
do
what
we
can
for
each
sufferer
as
he
confronts
us
,
hoping
that
this
will
spread
beyond
him
to
others
at_some_time
and
some
place
.
Never
have
I
seen
this
expressed
so
clearly
and
so
sympathetically
.
Thank_you
for
the
illustrated
editorial
``
Confrontation
''
.
It
is
both
great
writing
and
profound
religion
.
N._C.
has
said
something
important
so
well
that
this
preacher
will
many_times
be
tempted
to
quote
the
whole
piece
.
I
feel
that
N._C.
hit
the
very
core
of
our
existence
in
the
editorial
``
Confrontation
''
.
Personally
,
it
meant
a
great_deal
;
my
only
hope
is
that
it
will
be
shared
by
many
,
many
others
.
``
Confrontation
''
should
fortify
us
all
,
whether
in
Southeast_Asia
or
the
U._S.
.
Congratulations
to
N._C.
for
successfully
delving
into
the
heart
of
the
problems
that
face
the
Peace_Corps
.
I
concur
that
it
is
necessary
for
Americans
to
have
a
confrontation
of
the
situation
existing
in
foreign
lands
.
It
would
be
heartbreaking
to
see
idealism
,
and
hence
effective
leadership
,
thwarted
by
the
poverty
and
hardship
which
young
Americans
will
run_into
.
The
editorial
``
Confrontation
''
was
certainly
direct
in
its
appear
to
those
of
us
living
here
in
America
.
I
personally
gained
strength
from_it
.
Thanks
for
continuing
to
capture
the
attention
and
uncover
so
many
areas
of
need
in_this
amazing
world
.
N.
C
.
's
editorial
``
Confrontation
''
is
a
stunning
piece
of
writing
.
I
would
hope
that
Sargent_Shriver
will
encourage
everyone
entering
the
Peace_Corps
to
read
it
.
The
important
people
to
humanity
are
not
the
Khrushchevs
and
the
Castros
-
but
the
Schweitzers
and
the
Dooleys
,
and
the
others
like
them
whose
names
we
will
never
know
.

Reprints

A
Peace_Corps

described
the
editorial
as
``

need_to
communicate
to
the
men
and
women
who
will
soon

F._L._Lucas
's
article
in
SR
's
April
1
issue
seemed
to
be
a
very
fair
and
objective
analysis
of
the
New_English_Bible
.
I
certainly
hope
this
will
be
the
impression
left
in
the
minds
of
readers
,
rather_than
the
comment
by
Cleveland_Amory
in
his
First
Of
The
Month
column
.
It
is
blind
,
fundamentalist
dogmatism
to
say
,
``
Messing_around
with
the
King_James_version
seems
to
us
a
perilous
sport
at_best
''
.
Lester_Markel
is
on_the_right
track
in
his
article
``
Interpretation
of
Interpretation
''
[
SR
,
Mar.
11
]
.
The
current
stereotype
of
straight
news
reporting
was
probably
invaluable
in
protecting
the
press
and
its
readers
from
pollution
by
that
combination
of
doctored
fact
,
fancy
,
and
personal
opinion
called
yellow_journalism
which
flourished
in_this
country
more_than
a
generation
ago
.
We
do
n't
need
this
type
of
protection
any_more
.
The
public
is
now
armed
with
sophistication
and
numerous
competing
media
.
Besides
,
there
are
no_longer
enough
corruptible
journalists
about
.
The
accepted
method
of
writing
news
has
two
major
liabilities
.
First
,
it
does
not
communicate
.
A
reporter
restricted
to
the
competing
propaganda
statements
of
both
sides
in
a
major
labor
dispute
,
for_instance
,
is
unable
to
tell
his
readers
half
of_what
he
knows
about
the
causes
of
the
dispute
.
Second
,
it
subjects
the
news
to
distortion
by
the
unscrupulous
.
The
charges
by
the
late
junior
Senator
from
Wisconsin
not_only
destroyed
innocent
people
but
misled
the
nation
.
Yet
the
press
was
powerless
to
put
these
charges
in
perspective
in
its
news
columns
.
despite
several
years
of
front-page
stories
,
the
average
citizen
was
unable
to
get
a
complete
picture
of
McCarthy
until
he
saw
on
the
television
screen
what
the
reporters
had
been
seeing
all_along
but
had
no
effective
way
of
communicating
.
The
Senator
had
boxed
them
in
with
their
own
restrictions
.
It
seems
to
me
the
time
has
come
for
the
American
press
to
start
experimenting
with
ways
of
reporting
the
news
that
will
do
a
better
job
of
communicating
and
will
be
less
subject_to
abuse
by
those
who
have
learned
how
to
manipulate
the
present
stereotype
to
serve
their
own
ends
.
The
objective
should
be
to
provide
a
method
of
getting
into
print
a
higher
percentage
than
is
now
possible
of
the
relevant
information
in
the
possession
of
reporters
and
editors
.
I
would
like
to
see
you
devote
some
space
in
an
early
issue
to
the
news
blackout
concerning
President_Kennedy
's
activities
,
so_far
as
Southern_California
is
concerned
.
You
have
on
more_than
one
occasion
praised
the
idea
of
a
televised
press_conference
and
the
chance
it
gives
the
people
to
form
intelligent
opinions
.
To_begin_with
,
the
all-powerful
Los_Angeles
Times
does
not
publish
a
transcript
of
these
press_conferences
.
I
am
sure
that
they
did
when
Eisenhower
was
President
.
Next
,
because
of
the
time
differential
,
the
conferences
come_on
the
networks
during
the
middle
of
the
day
.
Up
until_now
,
the
networks
have
grudgingly
run
half-hour
tapes
at
5
P._M.
or
sometimes
7
or
10
:
30
P._M.
.
Even
then
,
a_few
of
the
``
less
interesting
''
questions
are
edited_out
and
glibly
summarized
by
a
commentator
.
However
,
last
night
the
tapes
were
not
run
at_all
during
the
evening
hours
and
all
we
got
on
TV
were
a_few
snatches
which
Douglas_Edwards
and
Huntley
and
Brinkley
could
squeeze
into
their
programs
.
This
is
no
criticism
of
them
,
as
they
obviously
cannot
get
a
half-hour
program
into
a
fifteen-minute
news
summary
.
The
radio_stations
did
run
``
transcripts
''
(
I
thought
)
during
the
evening
hours
.
However
,
by
comparing
the
TV
snatches
,
two
different
radio_station
re-runs
,
and
the
censored
Los_Angeles
Times
version
,
I
found
that
the
radio_stations
had
edited_out
questions
(
ABC
removed
the
one
regarding
Laos
)
or
even
a
paragraph
out
of
the
middle
of
the
President
's
answer
.
I
am
interested
to
know
he
is
getting
mail
from
all_over
the
country
about
the
``
abuse
''
he
is
being
subjected
to
.
We
out
here
do
n't
see
enough
of
the
conference
to
know
he
is
being
abused
.
I
do
n't
know
if
this
is
the
situation
in
other
parts
of
the
country
;
apparently
it
is
not
.
It
also
happened
with
the
Inauguration
,
which
was
not
re-run
at_all
during
the
evening
hours
,
and
I
wrote
to
the
TV
editor
of
the
Times
.
He
did
mention
in
his
column
the
fact
that
he
had
received
many
letters
about
this
and
he
himself
did
not
understand
the
networks
and
the
independent
local
stations
'
not
doing
this
-
but
nothing
happened
.
Can
you
bring
the
networks
'
attention
to
this
?
I
was
interested
in
James_Webb_Young
's
MADISON
AVENUE
column
in_which
he
raised
the
question
``
Do
We
Need
a
College
of
Propaganda
''
?
[
SR
,
Feb.
11
]
.
In
my
estimation
,
we
definitely
do
;
and
the
sad
part
of_it
is
that
we
had
one
,
which
was
rounding
into
excellent
shape
,
and
we
let
it
disintegrate
and
die
.
During
the
war
,
we
set_up
schools
for
the
teaching
of
psychological_warfare
,
which
included
the
teaching
of
propaganda
,
both
black_and_white
and
the
various
shades
of
grey
in_between
.
We
had
a_couple_of
schools
in_this
country
,
the
principal
one
being
on
the
Marshall_Field
estate
out
in
Lloyd
's
Neck
.
There
were
also
a
couple
in
Canada
,
and
several
in
England
.
The_English
schools
preceded
ours
,
and
by
the
time
we
got_into
it
they
had
learned
a_lot
about
the
techniques
of
propaganda
and
its
teaching
.
Four
of
us
here
in
the
United_States
attended
,
first
as
students
,
then
as
instructors
,
almost
every
one
of
these
schools
,
in
England
,
Canada
,
and
the
United_States
.
We
set_up
the
Lloyd
's
Neck
school
,
worked_out
its
curriculum
,
and
taught
there
.
Toward
the
end
of
the
war
,
we
really
felt
that
we
had
learned
something
about
propaganda
and_how
to
teach
it
.
When
the
end
did
come
,
and
the
schools
were
disbanded
and
abandoned
,
we
felt
and
hoped
that
the
machinery
of
psychological_warfare
would
not
be
allowed
to
rust
.
We
hoped
that
its
practitioners
and
teachers
might
be
put
on
some
sort_of
reserve
list
and
called_back
for
refresher_courses
each_year
or_so
.
Alas
,
no
such
thing
happened
.
There
apparently
is
no
school
of
propaganda
or
psychological_warfare
.
A
study
at
the
Pentagon
and
at
the
service
academies
revealed
that
nothing
was
being
done
there
.
And
not_one
of
the
four
men
who
attended
all
the
schools
has
ever
been
called_on
to
apply
any
of
his
knowledge
in_any_way
.
Congratulations
on
the
article
``
Do
We
Need
a
College
of
Propaganda
''
?
This
is
one
of
the_most
constructive
suggestions
made
in_this
critical
field
in
years
,
and
I
certainly
hope
it
sparks
some
action
.
Many_of
us
in_public
relations
were
flattered
that
Richard_L._Tobin
chose
to
devote
his
editorial
in
the
March
11
Communications
Supplement
to
the
merger
of
the
Public_Relations
Society
of
America
and
the
American
Public_Relations
Association
.
I
was
surprised
and
sorry
to
find
in
your
issue
of
March
4
a
long
and
detailed
attack
upon
a
book
that
had
not_yet
been
published
.
Whether
in
his
forthcoming
book
C._P._Snow
commits
the
errors
of
judgment
and
of
fact
with
which
your
heavily
autobiographical
critic
charged
him
is
important
.
One
should
be
able_to
get_hold_of
the
book
at_once
.
But
the
attack
was
made
from
an
advance
copy
.
If
this
practice
should
take_root
and
spread
,
the
man
who
submits
a
manuscript
to
a
publisher
will
find
himself
reviewed
before
he
is
accepted
and
publication
will
become
a
sort_of
post-mortem
formality
.
Editor
's
Note
:
Sir_Robert_Watson-Watt
wrote
,
on
page
50
of
SR
/
Research
for
4
March
1961
:
``
I
have
read
an
advance
copy
of
the
Snow
book
which
is
to
be
titled
,
'
Science
and
Government
'
.
Until
the
work
actually
appears
I
am
not
privileged
to
analyze
it
publicly
in_detail
.
But
I
have
compared
its
text
with
already
published
commentaries
on
the
1960
series
of
Godkin
lectures
at
Harvard
,
from
which
the
book
was
derived
,
and
I
can
with_confidence
challenge
the
gist
of
C._P._Snow
's
incautious
tale
''
.
Watson-Watt
's
remarks
in
SR
did
not
then
,
constitute
a
review
of
the
book
but
a
rebuttal
to
the
Godkin
Lectures
.
Representatives
of
Harvard_University
Press
,
which
is
publishing
the
book
this
month
of
April
,
recognize
and
freely
acknowledge
that
they
invited
such
reaction
by
allowing
Life
magazine
to
print
an
excerpt
from
the
book
in_advance
of
the
book
's
publication
date
.
The
text
of
the
book
leaves
a
somewhat
milder
impression
than
the
prepublication
excerpt
.
Sir_Robert_Watson-Watt
's
``
rebuttal
''
of
Sir_Charles_Snow
's
Godkin
Lectures
is
marred
throughout
by
too
forceful
a
desire
to
defend
Lindemann
and
apparently
himself
from
Sir_Charles
'
supposed
falsehoods
while
stating
those
``
falsehoods
''
in
an
unclear
incoherent
argument
.
The
article
presents
the
reader
with
an
absurdity
at
its
beginning
.
It
calls
the
conclusion
admitted
valid
by
``
historians
and
military
strategists
alike
''
a
``
perverted
conclusion
&
&
&
nonsense
''
.
It
submits
an
enthusiastic
,
impressionistic
conception
of
Lindemann
contributing
another
aspect
of
the
man
,
but
on
no_more
authoritative
basis
than
Sir_Charles
'
account
.
We
are
left
to
choose
between
the
two
Lindemanns
.
The
only
fact
that
holds
any
weight
in
the
article
is
the
result
of
the
tea_party
.
But
we
are
to
believe
that
Lindemann
actively
supported
radar
outside
the
Tizard_Committee
,
and
dissembling
,
discounted
it
inside
?
If
so
,
I
would
lean
to
Sir_Charles
'
conception
of
the
man
.
I
think
it
was
a
grave
error
to
print
the
article
at
this
time
.
To
the
unfortunate
people
unable
to
attend
the
Godkin
lectures
it
casts
an
unjustifiable
aura
of
falsehood
over
the
book
which
may
dissuade
some
people
from
reading
it
.
