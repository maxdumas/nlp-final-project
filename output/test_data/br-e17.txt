You
can
build
this
vacation
cottage
yourself
.
It
is
a
full
scale
,
small
,
but
efficient
house
that
can
become
a
year
'
round
retreat
complete
in
every
detail
.
Because
of
the
unique
design
by
the
architect
Egils_Hermanovski
,
you
can
build
most_of
it
in
your
own
home
workshop
in
your
spare_time
.
Most_of
it
is
panelized
and
utilizes
standard
materials
,
and
requires
the
use
of
only
simple
tools
.
On
the
following
pages
and
in
the
following
issues
we
take
you
every
step
of
the
way
to
your
vacation
cottage
,
from
choosing
the
proper
site
to
applying
the
final
trim
.
In
recognition
of
the
growing
trend
for
second
homes
,
or
vacation
cottages
,
we
have
designed
this
one
specifically
with
the
family
handyman
in
mind
.
It
is
a
big
project
,
not
to
be
taken
lightly
.
But
each
step
has
been
broken_down
into
easy
stages
,
utilizing
standard
materials
and
simple
tools
,
well
within
the
capabilities
of
the
handyman
.
The
idea
behind
our
design
is
modular
units
,
or
panelization
.
Everything
possible
has
been
scaled
to
standard
sizes
and
measurements
of
materials
.
Wall
panels
and
structural
timbers
are
standard
as
are
windows
and
doors
,
making_for
a
minimum
of
cutting
.
We
have
developed
an
ingenious
method
of
interlocking
these
so_that
you
can
make
the
major
part
of
your
house
in
your
own
workshop
,
panel
by
panel
,
according
to
plan
.
Thus
,
when
you
have
prepared
your
foundation
and
laid
the
floor
,
these
can
be
trucked
to
the
site
and
erected
with
a
small
crew
of
friends
in
a
weekend
.
The
roof
timbers
are
precut
and
the
panels
standard
so_that
the
house
can
be
completely
enclosed
in
a
matter
of
three
or
four
days
.
Then
you
can
do
the
finishing
touches
at
your
leisure
.
Due_to
the
fact
that
building_codes
and
regulations
vary
so_much
throughout
the
country
,
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
find_out
what
,
if
any
,
they
are
.
Close_to
a
large
city
they
might
even
specify
the
size
of
the
nails
used
;
in
a
remote
section
there
might
be
no
restrictions
at_all
.
This
can
usually
be
found_out
at
the
nearest
town_hall
.
At_the_same_time
check
the
electrical
,
plumbing
,
and
sanitary
requirements
,
as_well
as
possible
zoning
regulations
.
Whether
electricity
and
public
water
and
sewers
are
available
or
not
,
check
the
local
customs
in
the
use
of
bottled
or
L-P
gas
(
we
give
you
alternatives
later_on
)
.
Be
sure
that
this
information
is
reasonably
official
and
not
just
an
unfounded
opinion
.
If
there
are
any
major
restrictions
,
they
usually
can
be
obtained
in
printed
form
.
Where
a
building_permit
is
required
,
find_out
what
you
must
present
when
applying
for
one
.
In
many
cases
,
you
must
file
a
complete
set
of
plans
with
the
local
building
inspector
.
These
will
be
available
at
cost
from
our
Plans
Department
.
Some
general
things
to
look_for
in
a
site
,
if
you
have
n't
already
bought
one
,
are
accessibility
,
water
drainage
,
and
orientation
.
How
are
the
roads
,
and_how
will
they
stand_up
?
Is_there
evidence
of
wash-outs
on
the
property
;
swampy
areas
or
intermittent
springs
?
A
visit
in
the
early
spring
after
a
thaw
will
be
very
informative
.
Note
where
the
sun
rises
and
sets
,
and
ask
which
direction
the
prevailing_winds
and
storms
come
from
.
Will
the
view
be
something
you
can
live
with
?
Do
n't
worry
too_much
about
rocky
or
sloping
terrain
;
we
will
take_up
alternative
foundations
later_on
.
With
this
first
issue
we
give
you
a
list
of
the
materials
needed
to
build
the
basic
(
A
version
)
and
the
expandable
(
B
version
)
.
This
will
be
for
the
shell
of
the
house
only
(
roof
,
walls
,
and
floor
)
,
and
does
not
include
the
carport
or
balcony
.
This
will
permit
you
to
get
a
rough
estimate
of
how
much
the
materials
for
the
shell
will
cost
.
Bear_in_mind
that
this
does
not
include
interior
panels
for
partitions
,
fancy
flooring
,
appliances
and
fixtures
,
electrical
wiring
,
and
plumbing
,
all_of
which
will
be
taken_up
in_detail
in
later
issues
.
The
wall
panels
are_constructed
of
a
framework
of
standard
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
of
a
good
grade
,
free
from
structural
faults
.
They
should
be
as
straight
as
possible
,
as
this
will
effect
their
ability
to
mesh
properly
when
the
walls
are_erected
.
The
outside
surface
of
the
solid
units
shall
be
of
an
exterior
grade
of
panel
board
such_as
plywood
,
plastic
coated
panel
board
,
high
density
particle
board
,
asbestos-cement
board
,
or
any
other
product
locally
obtainable
upon
recommendation
of
your
building
supply
dealer
.
The
inner
panels
do
not
have_to
be
weatherproof
,
and
the
choice
will
depend_on
the
quality
of
finish
desired
.
All
panel
board
comes
in
standard
*
*
f
foot
size
.
It
is
recommended
that
panels
be
both
glued
as_well
as
nailed
to
the
frame
.
The
fixed
window
panels
with
louvers
should
have
a
good
grade
of
1
8
-
inch
double-strength
glass
set
in
a
mastic
glazing
compound
.
The
louvers
are_constructed
as
shown
in
the
detail
,
with
a
drop
door
for
ventilation
.
There
are
standard
sliding
glass
windows
in
wood
or
aluminum
frames
for
those
panels
requiring
them
.
The
door
panels
are
designed
to
accommodate
standard
doors
which
should
be
of
exterior
grade
.
The
filler
panels
for
the
gable_ends
are
cut
from
full
*
*
f
sheets
as
shown
,
leaving
no
wastage
.
The
battens
covering
the
joints
are
of
*
*
f
stock
and
are
applied
after
the
walls
are_erected
.
All
nails
should
be
rustproof
,
and
aluminum
is
highly
recommended
.
Note
:
If
1
2
-
inch
panel
board
is
used
inside
and
out
,
or
5
8
-
inch
one
side
and
3
8
-
inch
the
other
,
and
1
8
-
inch
glass
is
used
,
stock
lumber
in
*
*
f
,
*
*
f
,
and
*
*
f
can
be
used
in
making
the
glass
panels
.
Other
thicknesses
may
necessitate
ripping
a
special
size
lumber
for
the
glass
trim
.
In_any_case
,
there
is
no
special
milling
or
rabbeting
required
for
the
panels
.
With
modern
techniques
of
woodworking
and
the
multitude
of
cutting_tools
,
fixtures
,
and
attachments
available
,
the
drill
press
has
become
a
basic
home
workshop
tool
.
The
drill
press
consists_of
a
vertical
shaft
(
spindle
)
which
is
tapered
or
threaded
on
one
end
to
hold
a
drill
chuck
,
a
tubular
housing
(
quill
)
in_which
the
spindle
is
mounted
,
a
head
in_which
the
quill
is
mounted
,
a
feed
lever
which
moves
the
quill
up
or
down
,
a
power
source
,
and
a
movable
table
upon_which
the
work
is
placed
.
There
is
often
a
means
of
locking
the
quill
and
,
on
larger
presses
,
the
table
can
be
tilted
.
The
size
of
the
press
is
usually
expressed
in_terms_of
chuck
capacity
(
the
maximum
diameter
tool
shank
it
will
hold
)
or
distance
between
the
spindle
center
and
the
column
.
A
press
with
an
11
inch
capacity
lets
you
drill
to
the
center
of
a
22
inch
board
or
circle
.
A
new
radial
drill
press
with
a
16
inch
capacity
has
a
tilting
head
that
allows
drilling
to
be
done
at
any
angle
.
The
head
is
mounted
on
a
horizontal
arm
that
swivels
on
the
supporting
column
to
position
the
drill_bit
instead
of
the
work
.
The
drill
press
should
be
leveled
and
,
depending_on
whether
it
is
a
bench
or
floor
model
,
bolted
securely
to
a
sturdy
bench
or
stand
or
screwed
to
the
floor
with
lag
or
expansion
screws
.
This
will
reduce
vibration
and
increase
accuracy
.
A
coat
of
paste
wax
or
a
rubdown
with
a_piece
of
wax_paper
will
protect
the
polished
surface
of
the
table
;
wiping
with
a
slightly
oiled
cloth
will
discourage
rusting
of
the
column
and
quill
.
Presses
not
fitted
with
sealed
spindle
bearings
will
need
a
drop
of
oil
now_and_then
in
the
lubrication
holes
in
the
quill
.
The
rest
of
the
press
should
be
kept
clean
by
dusting
with
a
clean
rag
or
brush
.
Be
careful
to
keep
the
drive
belt
free_of
oil
and
grease
.
Belt
tension
is
adjusted
by
manipulation
of
two
locking
bolts
and
a
movable
motor
mount
.
Keep
the
belt
just
tight
enough
so
the
pulleys
won
n't
slip
when
pulled
by_hand
;
excess
tension
will
only
cause
undue
wear
on
the
motor
and
spindle
bearings
.
Most
drill
presses
have
a
quill
return
spring
that
raises
the
spindle
automatically
when
the
feed
lever
is_released
and
holds
the
quill
in
the
raised
position
.
The
return
spring
tension
may
be
adjusted
to
suit
individual
requirements
by
gripping
the
spring
housing
with
a
pair
of
pliers
(
to
prevent
the
spring
from
unwinding
when
it
is_released
)
,
loosening
the
lock
nut
or
screw
,
and
rotating
the
housing
until
the
desired
tension
is
achieved
.
Turning
the
housing
clockwise
will
reduce
tension
,
counter-clockwise
will
increase
it
.
Some
manufacturers
have
had
the
foresight
to
provide
a
socket
for
the
chuck
key
;
otherwise
,
you
'll
have_to
spend
a_few
minutes
to
either
attach
a
suitable
spring
clip
somewhere
on
the
press
head
or
fit
the
key
to
a
length
of
light
chain
and
fasten
to
the
bottom
of
the
motor
mount
so_that
the
key
is
out_of_the_way
when
not
in_use
.
Drill
speeds
are
important
if
you
want
a
good
job
.
Each
cutting_tool
will
operate
best
at
a
given
speed
,
depending_on
the
material
worked
.
On
most
drill
presses
,
it
is
impossible
to
get
the
exact
speed
,
but
you
can
come
close_by
adjusting
the
drive
belt
on
the
step-cone
pulleys
.
You
will
find
a
chart
giving
the
various
speed
ratios
available
with
your
particular
drill
press
somewhere
in
the
instruction
booklet
that
came_with
the
tool
.
See
the
table
on
page
34
for
exact
recommended
speeds
.
Generally
,
the
larger
the
tool
and
the
harder
the
material
,
the
slower
the
speed
.
Feed
pressure
is
also
of
major
importance
.
Too_much
pressure
will
force
the
tool
beyond
its
cutting
capacity
and
result
in
rough
cuts
and
jammed
or
broken
tools
.
Too
light
a
feed
,
particularly
with
metal
or
other
hard
material
,
causes
overheating
of
the
tool
and
burning
of
the
cutting_edge
.
The
best
results
will
be
obtained
by
matching
the
correct
speed
with
a
steady
feed
pressure
that
lets
the
tool
cut
easily
at
an
even
rate
.
There
are
numerous
types
and
styles
of
tools
to
drill
holes
.
The_most
common
are
the
twist_drill
,
the
solid
center
shaft
with
interchangeable
cutting
blades
,
the
double
spur
bit
,
and
the
power
wood
bit
.
All
will
do
a
good
job
if
sharp
,
but
the
twist_drills
do
n't
cut
quite
as
smoothly
as
the
others
,
since
they
do
not
have
the
outlining
spurs
that
sever
the
fibers
before
actual
boring
starts
.
The
adjustable
fly
cutter
is
very
useful
for
cutting
large
diameter
holes
and
can
be
used
to
cut
exact-size
discs
by
reversing
the
cutter
blade
.
Since
fly
cutters
are
one
sided
and
not
balanced
,
they
should
be
used
at
the
slowest
speed
available
,
and
fed
very
slowly
to
avoid
binding
.
Fly
cutters
can
fool
you
into
putting
your
hand
too_close
to
the
tool
,
so
if
you
want
to
avoid
nicked
fingers
,
keep
your
hands
well_out
of
the
way
.
When
drilling
all_the_way
through
a
workpiece
,
always
place
a_piece
of
scrap
wood
underneath
.
This
will
not_only
protect
the
work_table
,
but
also
assure
a
clean
breakthrough
.
Another
method
of
assuring
a
clean
hole
is
to
first
drill
a
small
pilot
hole
all_the_way
through
,
then
drill
half_way
with
the
dimensional
bit
,
turn
the
piece
over
,
and
finish
from
the
other
side
.
In
soft
woods
with
pronounced
grain
,
there
is
sometimes
a
tendency
for
the
hole
to
wander
,
due_to
the
varying
hardness
of
the
wood
.
In_this
case
,
drilling
a
small
pilot
hole
or
clamping
the
work
will
do
much
to
improve
accuracy
.
When
a
hole
is
to
be
bored
to
a
predetermined
depth
,
mark
the
depth
on_the_side
of
the
stock
,
then
run
the
bit
down
so_that
it
is
even
with
the
mark
.
The
depth
gauge
rod
can
now
be
set
,
and
any
number
of
holes
bored
to
exact
and
identical
depth
.
