A
cheery
smile
,
a
compassionate
interest
in
others
and
a
practical
down-to-earth
approach
.
Those
qualities
make
Esther_Marr
a
popular
asset
at
the
Salvation_Army
's
Social_Center
at
1200
Larimer_st.
.
The
pert
,
gray-haired
woman
who
came
to
Denver
three
years
ago
from
Buffalo
,
N._Y.
,
is
a
``
civilian
''
with
the
Army
.
Her
position
covers
a_number_of
daily
tasks
common
to
any
social
director
.
The
job
also
covers
a_number_of
other
items
.
``
Mom
''
Marr
,
as
the
more_than
80
men
at
the
center
call
her
,
is
the
link
that
helps
to
bridge
the
gulf
between
alcoholics
and
the
outside
world
and
between
parolees
and
society
.
Her
day
starts
early
,
but
no_matter_how
many
pressing
letters
there
are
to
be
written
(
and
during
May
,
which
is
National
Salvation_Army
Week
,
there
are
plenty
)
,
schedules
to
be
made
or
problems
to
be
solved
,
Mrs._Marr
's
office
is
always
open
and
the
welcome_mat
is
out
.
MRS._Marr
is
the
first
contact
a
Skid_Row
figure
talks
to
after
he
decides
he
wants
to
pick
himself
up
.
She
sees
that
there
is
a
cup
of
steaming
hot
coffee
awaiting
him
and
the
two
chat
informally
as
she
presents
the
rules
of
the
center
and
explains
procedures
.
``
Usually
at
this
point
a
man
is
withdrawn
from
society
and
one
of
my
jobs
is
to
see
that
he
relearns
to
mingle
with
his
fellow
men
''
,
Mrs._Marr
explained
.
The
Denverite
has
worked_out
an
entire
program
to
achieve
this
using
the
facilities
of
the
center
.
``
And
I
bum
tickets
to
everything
I
can
''
,
she
said
.
``
I
've
become
the
greatest
beggar
in
the
world
''
.
In_addition
to
the
tickets
to
the
movies
,
sporting
events
and
concerts
,
Mrs._Marr
lines_up
candy
and
cookies
because
alcoholics
require
a_lot_of
sweets
to
replace
the
sugar
in
their
system
.
Mrs._Marr
also
has
a_number_of
parolees
to
``
mother
''
,
watching
to
see
that
they
do
not
break
their
parole
and
that
they
also
learn
to
readjust
to
society
.
By
mid-June
,
millions
of
Americans
will
take
to
the
road
on
vacation
trips
up
and
down
and
back_and_forth
across
this
vast
and
lovely
land
.
In
another
four
weeks
,
with
schools
closed
across_the_nation
,
the
great
all-American
summer
safari
will
be
under_way
.
By
July_1
,
six
weeks
from
now
,
motel-keepers
all_over
the
nation
will
,
by
6
p.
m.
,
be
switching_on
that
bleak
-
to
motorists
-
sign
,
``
No
Vacancy
''
.
No_matter_how
many
Americans
go
abroad
in
summer
,
probably
a_hundred_times
as_many
gas_up
the
family
car
,
throw
suitcases
,
kids
and
comic_books
in_the_back
seat
,
and
head
for
home
.
And
where
is
``
home
''
,
that
magic
place
of
the
heart
?
Ah
,
that
is
simple
.
Home
is
where
a
man
was_born
,
reared
,
went_to
school
and
,
most
particularly
,
where
grandma
is
.
That
is
where
we
turn
in
the
good
old
summertime
.
The
land
lies
ready
for
the
coming
onslaught
.
My
husband
and
I
,
a
month
ahead
of
the
rush
,
have
just
finished
a
7
-
day
motor
journey
of
2809
miles
from
Tucson
,
Ariz.
,
to
New_York_City
.
I
can
testify
that
motels
,
service
and
comfort_stations
(
they
go
together
like
Scots
and
heather
)
,
dog
wagons
,
roadside
restaurants
,
souvenir
stands
and
snake
farms
are
braced
and
waiting
.
I
hope
it
can
be
said
without
boasting
that
no
other
nation
offers
its
vacationing
motorists
such
variety
and
beauty
of
scene
,
such
an
excellent
network
of
roads
on_which
to
enjoy
it
and
such
decent
,
far-flung
over-night
accommodations
.
Maybe
motel-keeping
is
n't
the
nation
's
biggest
industry
,
but
it
certainly
looks
that
way
from
the
highway
.
There
are
motels
for
all
purposes
and
all
tastes
.
There
are
even
motels
for
local
weather
peculiarities
,
as
I
discovered
in
Shamrock
,
Tex.
.
There
the
Royal_Motel
advertises
``
all
facilities
,
vented
heat
,
air
conditioned
,
carpeted
,
free
TV
,
storm_cellar
''
.
Innumerable
motels
from
Tucson
to
New_York
boast
swimming_pools
(
``
swim
at
your
own
risk
''
is
the
hospitable
sign
poised
at
the
brink
of
most
pools
)
.
Some
even
boast
two
pools
,
one
for
adults
and
one
for
children
.
But
the
Royal_Motel
in
Shamrock
was
the
only
one
that
offered
the
comfort
and
security
of
a
storm_cellar
.
Motorists
like
myself
who
can
remember
the
old
``
tourists
accommodated
''
signs
on
farm
houses
and
village
homes
before
World_War
2
,
can
only
marvel
at
the
great
size
and
the
luxury
of
the
relatively
new
and
fast-grossing
motel
business
.
At
the
Boxwood_Motel
in
Winchester
,
Va.
,
we
accidentally
drew
the
honeymoon
suite
,
an
elegant
affair
with
wall-to-wall
carpeting
,
gold
and
white
furniture
,
pink
satin
brocade
chairs
,
24
-
inch
TV
and
a
pink
tile
bath
with
masses
of
pink
towels
.
All
for
$
14
.
That
made_up
for
the
``
best
''
motel
in
Norman
,
Okla.
,
where
the
proprietor
knocked
$
2
off
the
$
8.50
tab
when
we
found
ants
in
the
pressed-paper
furniture
.
