A
royal
decree
issued
in
1910
,
two
years
after
the
Belgian
government
assumed
authority
for
the
administration
of
the
Congo
,
prescribed
the
registration
of
all
adult_males
by
chiefdoms
.
Further
decrees
along
this
line
were
issued
in
1916
and
1919
.
In
1922
a
continuous
registration
of
the
whole
indigenous
population
was
instituted
by
ordinance
of
the
Governor-General
,
and
the
periodic
compilation
of
these
records
was
ordered
.
But
specific
procedures
for
carrying_out
this
plan
were
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
provincial
governors
.
A
unified
set
of
regulations
,
applicable
to
all
areas
,
was
issued
in
1929
,
and
a
complementary
series
of
demographic
inquiries
in
selected
areas
was
instituted
at_the_same_time
.
The
whole
system
was
again
reviewed
and
reorganized
in
1933
.
General
responsibility
for
its
administration
rested
with
a
division
of
the
colonial
government
concerned
with
labor
supply
and
native
affairs
,
Service_des_Affaires_Indigenes
et
de
la
Main-d
'
Oeuvre
(
AIMO
,
Direction
,
Direction_Generale
,
Gouvernement_Generale
)
.
Tribal
authorities
,
the
chiefs
and
their
secretaries
,
were
held
responsible_for
maintaining
the
registers
of
indigenous
persons
within
their
territories
,
under
the
general
supervision
of
district
officials
.
The
district
officials
,
along
with
their
other
duties
,
were
obliged
to
organize
special
demographic
inquiries
in
selected
areas
and
to
supervise
the
annual
tabulations
of
demographic
statistics
.
The
regulations
require
the
inscription
of
each
individual
(
male
or
female
,
adult
or
child
)
on
a
separate
card
(
fiche
)
.
The
cards
,
filed
by
circonscription
(
sub-chiefdom
,
or
village
)
,
are
kept
in
the
headquarters
of
each
territoire
(
chiefdom
)
.
Each
card
is
expected
to
show
certain
information
about
the
individual
concerned
,
including
his
or
her
date
of
birth
(
or
age
at
a
specified
time
)
,
spouses
,
and
children
.
Additional
entries
must
be
made
from_time_to_time
.
Different
cards
are
used
for
males
and
females
,
and
a
corner
is
clipped
from
the
cards
of
adults
,
and
of
children
when
they
reach
puberty
.
So
a
quick
count
could
be
made
at_any_time
,
even
by
an
illiterate
clerk
,
of
the
number
of
registered
persons
in
four
age-and-sex
classes
.
Personal
identification
cards
are
issued
to
all
adult_males
on_which
tax
payments
,
inoculations
,
periods
of
employment
,
and
changes
of
residence
are
recorded
.
Similar
identification
cards
were
issued
in
1959
to
all
adult_females
.
Each
adult
is
held
personally
responsible_for
assuring
his
inscription
and
obtaining
an
identification
card
which
must
be
shown
on
demand
.
The
registration
card
of
a
person
leaving
his
home_territory
for
a
short
period
is
put
into
a
special
file
for
absent
persons
.
The
cards
of
permanent
out-migrants
are
,
in_theory
,
sent
to
an
office
in
the
place
of
new
residence
.
Finally
,
the
registration
of
births
and
deaths
by
nearest
relatives
was
made
compulsory
in
most
regions
.
Numbers
of
registered
persons
in
four
age-and-sex
classes
were
counted
each_year
.
In_addition
,
demographic
inquiries
,
supposedly
involving
field
investigations
,
were
conducted
in
selected
minor
divisions
(
circonscriptions
)
containing
about
3
percent
of
the
total
population
.
The
results
of
these
inquiries
were
used
to
adjust
compilations
of
data
from
the
registers
and
to
provide
various
ratios
and
rates
by
districts
,
including
birth
and
death_rates
,
general
fertility_rates
,
distributions
by
marital_status
,
fertility
of
wives
separately
in
polygynous
and
non-polygynous
households
,
infant
mortality
,
and
migration
.
The
areas
to
be
examined
in
these
inquiries
were
selected
by
local
officials
,
supposedly
as
representative
of
a
larger
population
.
Averages
of
the
ratios
obtained
in
a_few
selected
areas
were
applied
to
the
larger
population
.
The
scheme
,
in_theory
,
is
an
ingenious
adaptation
of
European
registration
systems
to
the
conditions
of
African
life
.
But
it
places
a
severe
strain
on
the
administrative
resources
(
already
burdened
in_other_ways
)
of
a
widely
dispersed
,
poor
and
largely
illiterate
population
.
The
sampling
program
was
instituted
before
the
principles
of
probability
sampling
were
widely
recognized
in
population
studies
.
The
system
was
not
well
adapted
to
conditions
of
life
in
urban_centers
.
The
distinction
between
domiciled
(
de_jure
)
and
present
(
de_facto
)
population
was
not
clearly
defined
.
So
the
results
are
subject
to
considerable
confusion
.
The
system
tended
to
break_down
during
the
war
,
but
was
reactivated
;
it
had
reached
the
pre-war
level
of
efficiency
by
1951
.
In_spite_of
the
defects
in_this
system
,
the
figures
on
total
population
during
the
late
1930
's
and
again
in
the
early
1950
's
seem
to
have
represented
actual
conditions
in
most
districts
with
approximate
fidelity
.
But
the
information
on
the
dynamics
of
population
was
often
quite
misleading
.
The
same
system
,
with
minor
modifications
,
was
developed
in
Ruanda-Urundi
under
Belgian
administration
.
Here
again
it
seems
that
useful
approximations
of
the
size
and
geographical
distribution
of
the
population
were
obtained
in_this_way
in
the
late
pre-war
and
early
post-war
periods
.
Before
considering
more
recent
activities
,
we
should
note
another
important
aspect
of
demography
in
Belgian
Africa
.
A_number_of
strong
independent
agencies
,
established
in
some
cases
with
governmental
or
royal
support
,
have
conducted
large
medical
,
social
,
educational
and
research
operations
in_particular
parts
of
the
Congo
and
Ruanda-Urundi
.
The
work
of
Fonds_Reine_Elisabeth
pour
l
'
Assistance_Medicale
aux
Indigenes_du_Congo_Belge
(
FOREAMI
)
has
special
interest
with_respect_to
demography
.
This
agency
accepted
responsibility
for
medical
services
to
a
population
ranging
from
638560
persons
in
1941
to
840503
in
1956
in
the
Kwango_District
and
adjacent
areas
east
of
Leopoldville
.
Each_year
from
1941
on
,
its
medical
staff
had
conducted
intensive
field
investigations
to
determine
changes
in
population
structure
and
vital
rates
and
,
as
its
primary
objective
,
the
incidence
of
major
diseases
.
Its
findings
are
reported
each_year
in
its
Rapport
sur
l
'
activite
pendant
annee
(
Bruxelles
)
.
Somewhat
similar
investigations
have
been
made
by
medical_officers
in
other
areas
.
Other
independent
,
or
partially
independent
agencies
,
have
promoted
investigations
on
topics
directly
or
indirectly
related_to
demography
.
These
studies
vary
widely
in
scope
and
precision
.
L
'
Institut
pour
la
Recherche_Scientifique
en
Afrique_Centrale
(
IRSAC
)
has
sponsored
well-designed
field
investigations
and
has
cooperated
closely
with
the
government
of
Ruanda-Urundi
in
the
development
of
its
official
statistics
.
A
massive
investigation
of
the
characteristics
of
in-migrants
and
prospective
out-migrants
in
Ruanda-Urundi
is
being
carried_on
by
J._J._Maquet
,
former
Director
of
the
Social_Science
branch
of
IRSAC
,
now
a
professor
at
l
'
Universite_Officielle_du_Congo_Belge
et
du_Ruanda-Urundi
.
Some
30000
completed
schedules
with
20
items
(
collected
by
sub-chiefs
in
1100
circumscriptions
)
have
been
tabulated
.
The
results
are
now
being
analyzed
.
Statistics
have
been
recognized
as
a
matter
of
strategic
importance
in
the
Congo
and
in
Ruanda-Urundi
during
the
post-war
years
in
connection
with
long-term
economic
and
social
programs
.
The
AIMO
organizations
of
both
countries
,
which
maintain
administrative
services
throughout
the
territories
,
retained
immediate
responsibility
for
the
collection
and
publication
of
demographic
information
.
However
,
the
statistical
offices
of
both
governments
were
assigned
responsibility
for
the
planning
and
analysis
of
these
statistics
.
A
Bureau
de
la
Demographie
(
A._Romaniuk
,
Director
)
was
formed
under
AIMO
in
the
Congo
,
to
work
in
close
rapport
with
the
Section
Statistique
of
the
Secretariat_General
.
Eventually
responsibility
for
demographic
inquiries
in
the
Congo
was
transferred
to
the
demographic
division
of
the
Central_Statistical_Office
.
The
1952
demographic
inquiry
in
Ruanda-Urundi
was
directed
by
V._Neesen
,
a
member
of
the
IRSAC
staff
,
though
the
inquiry
was
carried_out
under
the
auspices
of
AIMO
,
which
has
continuing
responsibility
for
demographic
statistics
in_this
territory
.
A
member
of
the
IRSAC
staff
(
E._van
de
Walle
)
was
recently
delegated
to
cooperate
with
AIMO
in
the
development
of
demographic
statistics
in_this
territory
.
The
initiation
of
sampling
censuses
in
Ruanda-Urundi
(
1952
)
and
in
the
Congo
(
1955
-
57
)
were
major
advances
.
We
will
deal
first
with
the
program
in
the
Congo
though
this
was
put
into
operation
later
than
the
other
.
The
radical
nature
of
the
innovation
in
the
Congo
was
not
emphasized
in
the
official
announcements
.
The
term
enquetes
demographiques
,
previously
used
for
the
supplementary
investigations
carried_out
in
connection
with
the
administrative
censuses
,
was
used
for
the
new
investigations
.
However
,
the
differences
in
procedure
are
fundamental
.
These
are
as_follows
:
Field
operations
were
transferred
from
administrative
personnel
primarily
engaged
in
other
tasks
to
specially
trained
teams
of
full-time
African
investigators
(
three
teams
,
each
working
in
two
provinces
)
.
These
teams
carried_out
the
same
operations
successively
in
different
areas
.
Sample
areas
in
the
new
investigations
were
selected
strictly
by
application
of
the
principles
of
probability_theory
,
so_as_to
be
representative
of
the
total
population
of
defined
areas
within
calculable
limits
.
In_short
,
scientific
sampling
was
introduced
in_place
of
subjective
sampling
.
The
populations
of
the
various
districts
,
or
other
major
divisions
,
were
stratified
by
type
of
community
(
rural
,
urban
,
mixed
)
and
,
where
appropriate
,
by
ethnic
affiliation
and
by
type
of
economy
.
Sample
units
(
villages
in
rural_areas
,
houses
in
cities
)
were
drawn
systematically
within
these
strata
.
Different
sampling
ratios
were
applied
under
different
conditions
.
Higher
proportions
were
sampled
in
urban
and
mixed
communities
than
in
rural_areas
.
About
11
percent
of
the
total
population
was
covered
in
the
new
investigation
,
as
compared
with
about
3
percent
in
the
previous
inquiries
.
Uniform
questions
,
definitions
,
and
procedures
were
enforced
throughout
the
whole
country
.
Data
were
obtained
,
separately
,
on
three
classes
of
persons
:
(
a
)
residents
,
present
;
(
b
)
residents
,
absent
;
and
(
c
)
visitors
.
In
the
reports
,
summary
results
are
given
for
both
the
de_facto
(
a
and
c
)
and
de_jure
(
a
and
b
)
populations
;
but
the
subsequent
analysis
of
characteristics
is
reported
only
for
the
de_jure
population
(
or
,
in
some
districts
,
only
the
de_facto
population
)
.
These
changes
represent
in_effect
,
a
shift
from
(
1
)
an
administrative
compilation
of
data
obtained
through
procedures
designed
primarily
to
serve
political
and
economic
objectives
to
(
2
)
a
systematic
sampling
census
of
the
whole
African
population
.
The
population
registration
system
still
has
important
functions
.
It
supplies
local
data
which
are
useful
in
administration
and
which
can
be
used
as
a
basis
for
intensive
studies
in_particular
situations
.
It
provides
a
frame
for
the
sampling
census
.
It
also
provides
a
frame
within
which
the
registration
of
vital
events
is
gradually
gaining
force
(
though
one
cannot
expect
to
obtain
reliable
vital
statistics
in
most
parts
of
the
Congo
from
this
source
in
the
near
future
)
.
It
is
still
used
in
making
current
population
estimates
in
post-census
years
,
though
the
value
of
these
estimates
is
open_to
question
.
Finally
,
it
may
have
certain
very
important
,
less
obvious
values
.
Even_though
the
registers
may
have
an
incomplete
record
of
persons
present
in
a
particular
area
or
include
persons
no_longer
living
there
,
they
contain
precise
information
on
ages
,
by
date
of
birth
,
for
some
of
the
persons
present
(
especially
children
in
relatively
stable
communities
)
and
supplementary
information
(
such_as
records
of
marital_status
)
for
many
others
.
The
quality
of
the
census
data
can
,
therefore
,
be
greatly
improved
by
the
use
of
the
registration
records
in
conjunction
with
the
field
inquiries
.
Furthermore
,
it
may
be
possible
to
estimate
the
error
due_to
bias
in
method
(
as
distinguished
from
sampling
error
)
in
each
of
these
sources
,
on
such
subjects
as
fertility
,
mortality
,
and
migration
during
a
given
interval
by
using
information
from
two
largely
independent
sources
in
conjunction
.
The
first
sampling
census
in
the
Congo
extended
over
a
three-year
period
,
1955
-
57
;
the
results
were
still
being
processed
in
1959
.
It
is
planned
to
double
the
number
of
teams
and
to
make
use
of
improved
equipment
in
a
second
demographic
inquiry
in
1960
,
so_that
the
inquiry
can
be
carried_through
in
one
year
and
the
results
published
more
expeditiously
.
It
is
proposed
that
in_the_future
complete
sampling
censuses
be
carried_out
at
five-year
intervals
.
Reports
already
issued
on
the
sampling
census
,
1955
-
57
,
in
various
areas
run
as_follows
(
using
only
the_French
and
omitting
corresponding
Flemish
titles
)
:

This
report
contains
preliminary
notes
and
35
tables
.
Other
reports
in
identical
form
,
but
with
somewhat
varying
content
,
have
been
issued
for
:
.
These
area
reports
will
be
followed
,
according
to
present
plans
,
by
a
summary
report
,
which
will
include
a
detailed
statement
on
methods
.
