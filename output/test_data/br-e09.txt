The
best
2
-
year-old
pacing
mile
up_to_date
at
Ben_White_Raceway
has
been
that
of
Mary_Liner
(
Mainliner-Highland_Ellen
)
,
a
member
of
the
Dick_Williams
stable
,
who
was
clocked
2
:
25
.
She
is
owned
by
Ralph_H._Kroening
,
Milwaukee
,
Wis.
,
who
,
according
to
the
railbirds
,
can
feel
justly
proud_of
her
.
Other
good
miles
have
been
by
Debonnie
(
Dale_Frost-Debby_Hanover
)
and
Prompt_Time
(
Adios-On_Time
)
in
2
:
28
-
:
36
;
Kimberly_Gal
(
Galophone-Kimberly_Hanover
)
2
:
26.2
;
Laguerre_Hanover
(
Tar_Heel
-
Lotus_Hanover
)
and
Monel
(
Tar_Heel-Miracle_Byrd
)
in
2
:
34
h
.
Laguerre_Hanover
is
outstanding
in
type
and
conformation
-
good
body
,
plenty
of
heart
girth
,
stands
straight
on
his
legs
on
excellent
feet
-
and
has
the
smoothest
gait
.
This
colt
is
behind
most_of
the
other
2
-
year-olds
in
the
Simpson
stable
but
can
show
about
as
much
pace
as
any
of
them
.
Monel
shows
improvement
with
each
work-out
and
looks
the
makings
of
a
good
brood
mare
after
winning
her
share
of
races
.
Stardel
(
Star
's
Pride-Starlette_Hanover
)
,
2
:
34
h
,
looks
quite
promising
.
Fury_Hanover
(
Hoot_Mon-Fay
)
,
Caper
(
Hoot_Mon-Columbia_Hanover
)
and
Isaac
(
Hoot_Mon-Goddess_Hanover
)
have
been
working
together
but
have
not
equalled
their
best
work
done
some
weeks
ago
.
Fury
and
Caper
worked
in
2
:
35
h
and
did
it
with
ease
.
They
are
two
good
colts
of
different
type
.
Fury
is
upstanding
and
on
the
rangy
side
,
and
Caper
is
more
the
compact
type
.
I
have
never
seen
Caper
off
his
feet
-
he
seems
to
know
nothing
but
'
trot
'
and
keeps
trying
a_little
harder
if
asked
to
do
so
.
Fury
has
made
a_few
mistakes
but
looks
like
a
wonderful
prospect
,
with
his
impressive
gait
and
stride
which
certainly
make
him
cover
the
ground
.
Trackdown
(
Torrid-Mighty_Lady
)
has
worked
a
mile
in
2
:
33.3
h
.
It
took
this
colt
several
weeks
to
strike
a
pace
.
Then
,
after
emasculation
,
he
was
eased_up
for
a_couple_of
weeks
.
He
has
thrived
on
all
he
has
gone_through
and
looks
the
makings
of
a
good
little
race_horse
.
Thor_Hanover
(
Adios-Trustful_Hanover
)
is
a
wonderful
looking
prospect
and
another
good
individual
,
with
solid
,
rugged
conformation
,
good
,
flat_bone
and
excellent
feet
.
This
colt
arrived_at
the
Raceway
early
last
November
,
and
immediately
was
put
into
harness
and
line-driven
for
a_few
days
,
and_then
put
to
cart
and
broken_in
very
nicely
,
knowing
nothing
but
trot
.
He
appeared
in
the
hopples
about
November
14
,
was
treated
for
worms
on
the
18
th
,
the
latter
date
being
the
first
time
he
struck
a
real
pace
.
On
December
5
he
paced
a
mile
in
2
:
55
on
the
twice-around
,
out
in
third
position
all_the_way
.
This
colt
has
done
everything
asked
of
him
,
and
done
it
with
ease
.
His
best
mile
to_date
is
2
:
32.2
h
.
Gamecock
(
Tar_Heel-Terka_Hanover
)
is
another
promising
colt
,
and
his
best
time
is
2
:
32.2
h
.
This
is
one
of
the
best-tempered
Tar
Heels
ever
at
the
center
.
The
first
time
he
was
harnessed
he
stood
like
a
gentle
old
mare
;
the
crupper
under
his
tail
seemed
to
be
old
stuff
.
The
fourth
time
in
harness
he
walked
off
like
a
gentleman
.
Being
blistered
for
curbs
has
delayed
his
work
somewhat
.
But
up_to_date
he
has
shown
as
much_as
any
in
the
big
Simpson
stable
.
Hustler
(
Knight_Dream-Torkin
)
is
a
playful
bay
rascal
of
a
colt
,
not
the
best
gaited
,
but
he
surely
can
pace
and
is
right_there
with
them
,
and
sometimes
leading
them
,
in
the
best
miles
.
Torrid_Freight
(
Torrid-Breeze
On
Hal
)
is
a
very
rugged
,
strong-made
colt
with
a
wonderful
stride
who
has
done
with
ease
everything
asked
of
him
.
His
best
time
is
around
2
:
33
.
Strongheart
(
Adios-Direct_Gal
)
,
a
fair-looking
sorrel
colt
,
knows
nothing
but
pace
and
has
been
right_there
in
the
best
miles
.
Torrid_Adios
(
Torrid-Adios_Molly
)
is
not
so
masculine
as
most_of
the
colts
,
but
I
like
his
type
and
he
certainly
is
one
of
the
best-gaited
pacers
on
the
grounds
.
Blistered
for
curbs
and
laid_off
three
weeks
,
he
is
coming_along
fine
and
looks_like
a
pacer
to
me
.
First_Flyer
(
Frisco_Flyer-Castle_Light
)
looks_like
a
splendid
candidate
for
the
Illinois_Stakes
.
His
best
time
is
2
:
33.2
h
.
The
colts
in
Simpson
's
stable
have
little
if
anything
on
the
fillies
,
especially
the
pacers
.
Justine_Hanover
(
Sampson_Hanover-Justitia_Hanover
)
is
improving
with
each
work-out
and
paced
2
:
32.4
h
weeks
ago
.
Mrs._Freight
(
Knight_Dream-Miss_Reed
)
shows
promise
and
does
it
in
good
form
,
and
her
best
time
is
about
2
:
35
.
Hoopla
(
Tar_Heel-Holiday_Hanover
)
,
a
filly
that
wanted
to
trot
,
knocked
herself
October
31
and
November_1
fighting
the
hopples
.
She
was
then
trained
on
the
trot
until
December
29
,
hitched
to
a
breaking
cart
once
around
the
half-mile
track
and
hoppled
again
.
This
time
she
submitted
and
in
a_few
days
was
going
good
.
On
January
11
she
paced
a
mile
in
2
:
43.1
-
:
38
h
;
on
Jan.
18
2
:
37.3
-
:
36.1
h
;
on
Jan.
21
,
2
:
36
.
This
filly
is
a
much
better
individual
than
either
of
her
full-sisters
,
Valentine_Day
and
Cerise
-
more
scale
and
much
better
underpinning
.
She
is
more
like
her
full
brother
,
Taraday_Hanover
,
but
larger
.
Up_to_date
she
is
a
grand-looking
filly
.
Pete_Dailey
has
four
promising
2
-
year-old
pacers
.
Marquis
Pick
(
Gene_Abbe-Direct_Grattan
)
seems
to
be
the
pick
of
the
stable
at_the_present_time
.
He
is
a
fine-looking
colt
with
a
good
body
,
good
set
of
legs
and
nice
way
of
going
.
His
best
mile
to_date
is
2
:
28

:
33

Majestic
Pick
comes
next
,
with
a
mile
in
2
:
30
-
:
33.2
.
This
colt
is
another
fine-looking
equine
.
Staley_Hanover
(
Knight_Dream-Sweetmite_Hanover
)
is
a_little
on
the
small
side
but
a
very
compact
colt
and
looks_like
one
to
stand
training
and
many
future
battles
with
colts
in
his
class
.
Best
time
to_date
is
2

The

saw
the
latter
filly

trotted

me
and
I
noticed
such
a
family
resemblance
that
I
said
to
myself
,
``
that
must
be
Hickory_Ash

She
is
a
beautiful
filly

likes

The
last-named
is
one
of
the
favorites
in
the
stable
,
and
the
boys
like
her
very_much
.
I
will
be
able
to
tell
you
more
about
this
string
of
equines
in
the
near
future
.
I
have
just
seen
Debonnie
and
Prompt_Time
work
a
mile
in
2
:
34
,
last_quarter
in
:
35.3
.
In
going_away
Debonnie
got_behind
several
lengths
,
stalling
at_the_start
-
she
is
a_little
fussy
.
They
left
the
three-quarters
together
and
finished
almost
together
.
Prompt_Time
shows
class
.
This
filly
is
another
Adios
that
wants
to
trot
,
and
trot
she
did
until
forced
to
do
otherwise
.
After
well
broken
and
equipped
with
12
oz
shoes
on
behind
,
bare-footed
in_front
,
she
would
trot
a
real
storm
with
the
master
,
Delvin
,
driving
.
Being
placed
in
the
hopples
she
was
completely
baffled
.
She
hesitated
,
she
hopped
,
she
roll
and
rocked
,
skipped
and
jumped
,
but
in
some
two_weeks
she
started
to
pace
,
From_that
time
to
this
she
has
shown
steady
improvement
and
now
looks_like
one
of
the
classiest
things
on
the
grounds
.
Rain

Friday
prevented
many
workouts
