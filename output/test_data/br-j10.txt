Apart
from
the
honeybee
,
practically
all
bees
and
bumblebees
hibernate
in
a
state
of
torpor
.
Occasionally
,
you
may
come_across
one
or
two
bumblebees
in
the
cold
season
,
when
you
are
turning_over
sods
in
your
garden
,
but
you
have_to
be
a
really
keen
observer
to
see
them
at_all
.
They
keep
their
wings
and
feet
pressed
tightly
against
their
bodies
,
and
in_spite_of
their
often
colorful
attire
you
may
very
well
mistake
them
for
lumps
of
dirt
.
I
must
add
at_once
that
these
animals
are
what
we
call
``
queens
''
,
young
females
that
have
mated
in
the
previous
summer
or
autumn
.
It
is
on
them
alone
that
the
future
of
their
race
depends
,
for
all
their
relatives
(
mothers
,
husbands
,
brothers
,
and
unmated
sisters
)
have
perished
with
the
arrival
of
the
cold_weather
.
Even
some
of
the
queens
will
die
before
the
winter
is
over
,
falling
prey
to
enemies
or
disease
.
The
survivors
emerge
on
some
nice
,
sunny
day
in
March
or
April
,
when
the
temperature
is
close
to
50
`
F
and
there
is
not
too_much
wind
.
Now
the
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
find
ourselves
a_couple_of
those
wonderful
flowering
currants
such_as
the
red
Ribes_sanguineum
of
our
Pacific_Northwest
,
or
otherwise
a
good
sloe
tree
,
or
perhaps
some
nice
pussy_willow
in
bloom
,
preferably
one
with
male
or
staminate
catkins
.
The
blooms
of
Ribes
and
of
the
willow
and
sloe
are
the
places
where
large_numbers
of
our
early
insects
will
assemble
:
honeybees
,
bumblebees
,
and
other
wild
bees
,
and
also
various
kinds
of
flies
.
It
is
a
happy
,
buzzing
crowd
.
Each
male
willow
catkin
is
composed
of
a
large_number
of
small
flowers
.
It
is
not
difficult
to
see
that
the
stamens
of
the
catkin
are
always
arranged
in
pairs
,
and
that
each
individual
flower
is
nothing
but
one
such
pair
standing
on
a
green
,
black
tipped
little
scale
.
By
scrutinizing
the
flowers
,
one
can
also
notice
that
the
scale
bears
one
or
two
tiny
warts
.
Those
are
the
nectaries
or
honey
glands
(
Fig.
26
,
page
74
)
.
The
staminate
willow
catkins
,
then
,
provide
their
visitors
with
both
nectar
and
pollen
;
a
marvelous
arrangement
,
for
it
provides
exactly
what
the
bee
queens
need
to
make
their
beebread
,
a
combination
of
honey
and
pollen
with
which
the
young
of
all
species
are
fed
.
The
only
exception
to
this
is
certain
bees
that
have
become
parasites
.
I
will
deal
with
these
later_on
.
Quite
often
,
honeybees
form
a
majority
on
the
willow
catkins
.
As
we
have
already
seen
in
the
first
chapter
,
bumblebees
are
bigger
,
hairier
,
and
much
more
colorful
than
honeybees
,
exhibiting
various
combinations
of
black
,
yellow
,
white
and
orange
.
Let
us
not
try
to
key
them
out
at
this
stage
of
the
game
,
and
let
us
just
call
them
Bombus
;
there
must
be
several
dozen
species
in
the
United_States
alone
.
If
you
really
insist
on
knowing
their
names
,
an
excellent
book
on
the
North_American
species
is
Bumblebees
and
Their
Ways
by
O._E._Plath
.
If
we
manage
to
keep
track
of
a
Bombus
queen
after
she
has
left
her
feeding
place
,
we
may
discover
the
snug
little
hideout
which
she
has
fixed_up
for
herself
when
she
woke_up
from
her
winter
sleep
.
As
befits
a
queen
,
a
bumblebee
female
is
rather
choosy
and
may
spend
considerable
time
searching
for
a
suitable
nesting_place
.
Most
species
seem
to
prefer
a
ready-made
hollow
such_as
a
deserted
mouse_nest
,
a
bird_house
,
or
the
hole
made
by
a
woodpecker
;
some
show
a
definite
liking
for
making
their
nest
in
moss
.
Once
she
has
made_up_her_mind
,
the
queen
starts_out
by
constructing
,
in
her
chosen
abode
,
a
small
``
floor
''
of
dried
grass
or
some
woolly
material
.
On
this
,
she
builds
an
``
egg
compartment
''
or
``
egg
cell
''
which
is
filled
with
that
famous
pollen
and
nectar
mixture
called
beebread
.
She
also
builds
one
or
two
waxen
cups
which
she
fills
with
honey
.
Then
,
a
group
of
eggs
is
deposited
in
a
cavity
in
the
beebread
loaf
and
the
egg
compartment
is
closed
.
The
queen
afterward
keeps
incubating
and
guarding
her
eggs
like
a
mother
hen
,
taking
a
sip
from_time_to_time
from
the
rather
liquid
honey
in
her
honey
pots
.
When
the
larvae
hatch
,
they
feed_on
the
beebread
,
although
they
also
receive
extra
honey
meals
from
their
mother
.
She
continues
to
add
to
the
pollen
supply
as_needed
.
The
larvae
,
kept
warm
by
the
queen
,
are
full_grown
in
about
ten
days
.
Each
now
makes
a
tough
,
papery
cocoon
and
pupates
.
After
another
two_weeks
,
the
first
young
emerge
,
four
to
eight
small
daughters
that
begin
to
play
the
role
of
worker_bees
,
collecting
pollen
and
nectar
in
the
field
and
caring
for
the
new
young
generation
while
the
queen
retires
to
a
life
of
egg_laying
.
The
first
worker_bees
do
not
mate
or
lay
eggs
;
males
and
mating
females
do
not
emerge
until
later
in
the
season
.
The
broods
of
workers
that
appear
later
tend
to
be
bigger
than
the
first
ones
,
probably
because
they
are
better
fed
.
By
the
middle
of
the
summer
,
many_of
the
larvae
apparently
receive
such
a
good
diet
that
it
is
``
optimal
''
,
and
it
is
then
that
young
queens
begin
to
appear
.
Simultaneously
,
males
or
drones
are
produced
,
mostly
from
the
unfertilized
eggs
of
workers
,
although
a
few
may
be
produced
by
the
queen
.
The
young
queens
and
drones
leave
the
nest
and
mate
,
and
after
a
short
period
of
freedom
,
the
fertilized
young
queens
will
begin
to
dig
in
for
the
winter
.
It
is
an
amazing
fact
that
in
some
species
this
will
happen
while
the
summer
is
still
in_full_swing
,
for_instance
,
in
August
.
The
temperature
then
is
still
very
high
.
At
the
old
nest
,
the
queen
will
in
the
early
fall
cease
to
lay
the
fertilized
eggs
that
will
produce
females
.
As
a
result
,
the
proportion
of
males
(
which
leave
the
nest
)
increases
,
and
eventually
the
old
colony
will
die_out
completely
.
The
nest
itself
,
the
structure
that
in
some
cases
housed
about
2000
individuals
when
the
season
was
at
its
peak
,
is
now
rapidly
destroyed
by
the
scavenging
larvae
of
certain
beetles
and
moths
.
Not
always
,
though
,
does
the
development
of
a
bumblebee
colony
take_place
in
the
smooth
fashion
we
have
just
described
.
Some
members
of
the
bee
family
have
become
idlers
,
social
parasites
that
live
at
the
expense
of
their
hardworking
relatives
.
Bumblebees
can
thus
suffer
severely
from
the
onslaughts
of
Psithyrus
,
the
``
cuckoo_bumblebee
''
as
it
is
called
in
some
European_countries
.
Female
individuals
of
Psithyrus
look
deceptively
like
the
workers
and
queens
of
the
bumblebees
they
victimize
.
The
one
sure
way
to
tell
victim
and
villain
apart
is
to
examine
the
hind_legs
which
in
the
case
of
the
idler
,
Psithyrus
,
lack
the
pollen
baskets
-
naturally
!
The
female
parasite
spends
much
time
in
her
efforts
to
find
a
nest
of
her
host
.
When
she
succeeds
,
she
usually
manages
to
slip_in
unobtrusively
,
to
deposit
an
egg
on
a
completed
loaf
of
beebread
before
the
bumblebees
seal
the
egg
compartment
.
The
hosts
never
seem
to
recognize
that
something
is
amiss
,
so
that
the
compartment
afterward
is
sealed
normally
.
Thus
,
the
larvae
of
the
intruder
can
develop
at
the
expense
of
the
rightful
inhabitants
and
the
store
of
beebread
.
Later_on
,
they
and
the
mother
Psithyrus
are
fed
by
the
Bombus
workers
.
Worse
still
,
in
a
number
of
cases
it
has
been
claimed
that
the
Psithyrus
female
kills_off
the
Bombus
queen
.
But
let
us
return
,
after
this
gruesome
interlude
,
to
our
willow
catkins
in
the
spring
;
there
are
other
wild
bees
that
command
our
attention
.
It
is
almost
certain
that
some
of
these
,
usually
a_trifle
smaller
than
the
honeybees
,
are
andrenas
or
mining_bees
.
There
are
about
200
different
kinds
of
Andrena
in
Europe
alone
.
One
of
my
favorites
is
A._armata
,
a
species
very
common
in
England
,
where
it
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
lawn
bee
.
The
females
like
to
burrow
in
the
short
turf
of
well-kept
lawns
,
where
their
little
mounds
of
earth
often
appear
by
the
hundreds
.
Almost
equal
in
size
to
a
honeybee
.
A._armata
is
much
more
beautiful
in
color
,
at_least
in
the
female
of
the
species
:
a
rich
,
velvety
,
rusty
red
.
The
males
are
much
duller
.
After
having
mated
,
an
Andrena
female
digs
a
hole
straight
down
into
the
ground
,
forming
a
burrow
about
the
size
of
a
lead_pencil
.
The
bottom
part
of
a
burrow
has
a
number
of
side
tunnels
or
``
cells
''
,
each
of
which
is
provided
with
an
egg
plus
a
store
of
beebread
.
The
development
of
the
Andrena
larvae
is
very
rapid
,
so
that
by
the
end
of
spring
they
have
already
pupated
and
become
adults
.
But
they
are
still
enclosed
in
their
larval
cells
and
remain
there
throughout
the
summer
,
fall
,
and
winter
.
Their
appearance
,
next
spring
,
coincides
in
an
almost
uncanny
way
with
the
flowering
of
their
host
plants
.
In
the
Sacramento
valley
in
California
,
for_instance
,
it
has
been
observed
that
there
was
not
one
day
's
difference
between
the
emergence
of
the
andrenas
and
the
opening
of
the
willow
catkins
.
This
must
be_due
to
a
completely
identical
response
to
the
weather
,
in
the
plant
and
the
animal
.
After
the
male
and
female
andrenas
have
mated
,
the
cycle
is
repeated
.
Although
Andrena
is
gregarious
,
so
that
we
may
find
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
burrows
together
,
we
must
still
call
it
a
solitary
bee
.
Its
life_history
is
much
simpler
than
that
of
the
truly
colonial
bumblebees
and
can
serve
as
an
example
of
the
life_cycle
of
many
other
species
.
After_all
,
social
life
in
the
group
of
the
bees
is
by_no_means
general
,
although
it
certainly
is
a
striking
feature
.
On
the
basis
of
its
life_history
,
we
like
to
think
that
Andrena
is
more
primitive
than
the
bumblebees
.
The
way
in
which
it
transports
its
pollen
is
not
so
perfect
,
either
.
It
lacks
pollen
baskets
and
possesses
only
a
large_number
of
long
,
branched
hairs
on
its
legs
,
on
which
the
pollen
grains
will
collect
.
Still
Andrena
will
do
a
reasonably
good
job
,
so
that
an
animal
with
a
full
pollen
load
looks_like
a
gay
little
piece
of
yellow
down
floating
in
the
wind
.
Closely
related
to
the
andrenas
are
the
nomias
or
alkali_bees
.
Nomia_melanderi
can
be
found
in
tremendous
numbers
in
certain
parts
of
the
United_States
west
of
the
Great_Plains
,
for_example
,
in
Utah
and
central
Washington
.
In
the
United_States
Department_of_Agriculture
's
Yearbook_of_Agriculture
,
1952
,
which
is
devoted
entirely
to
insects
,
George_E._Bohart
mentions
a
site
in
Utah
which
was
estimated
to
contain
200000
nesting
females
.
Often
the
burrows
are
only
an
inch
or
two
apart
,
and
the
bee
cities
cover
several
acres
.
The
life_history
of
the
alkali_bee
is
similar
to
that
of
Andrena
,
but
the
first
activity
of
the
adults
does
not
take_place
until
summer
,
and
the
individuals
hibernate
in
the
prepupal
stage
.
In
most
places
,
there
are
two
generations
a
year
,
a
second
brood
of
adults
appearing
late
in
the
summer
.
I
must
plead
guilty
to
a
special
sympathy
for
nomias
.
This
may
just
be
pride
in
my
adopted
State_of_Washington
,
but
certainly
I
love
to
visit
their
mound
cities
near
Yakima
and
Prosser
in
July
or
August
,
when
the
bees
are
in
their
most
active
period
.
The
name
``
alkali_bee
''
indicates
that
one
has_to
look_for
them
in
rather
inhospitable
places
.
Sometimes
,
although
by_no_means
always
,
these
are
indeed
alkaline
.
The
thing
is
that
these
bees
love
a
fine-grained
soil
that
is
moist
;
yet
the
water
in
the
ground
should
not
be
stagnant
either
.
They
dislike
dense
vegetation
.
Where
does
one
find
such
conditions
?
The
best
chance
,
of_course
,
is
offered
by
gently
sloping
terrain
where
the
water
remains
close
to
the
surface
and
where
the
air
is
dry
,
so
that
a
high
evaporation
leaves
salty
deposits
which
permit
only
sparse
plant
growth
.
