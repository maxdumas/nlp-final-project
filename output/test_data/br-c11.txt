Mischa_Elman
shared
last
night
's
Lewisohn_Stadium
concert
with
three
American
composers
.
His
portion
of
the
program
-
and
a
big
portion
it
was
-
consisted_of
half
the
major
nineteenth-century
concertos
for
the
violin
:
to
wit
,
the
Mendelssohn
and
the
Tchaikovsky
.
That
is
an
evening
of
music-making
that
would
faze
many_a
younger
man
;
Mr._Elman
is
70
years
old
.
There
were
8000
persons
at
the
Stadium
who
can
tell
their
grandchildren
that
they
heard
Elman
.
But
,
with
all
due
respects
and
allowances
,
it
must
truthfully
be
said
that
what
they
heard
was
more
syrupy
than
sweet
,
more
mannered
than
musical
.
The
occasion
was
sentimental
;
so
was
the
playing
.
The
American
part
of
the
evening
consisted_of
Paul_Creston
's
Dance_Overture
,
William_Schuman
's
``
Chester
''
from
``
New_England
Triptych
''
and
two
works
of
Wallingford_Riegger
,
Dance
Rhythms
,
Op.
58
,
and
a
Romanza
for
Strings
,
Op.
56
A
.
The
Creston
is
purely
a
potboiler
,
with
Spanish
,
English
,
French
and
American
dances
mixed
into
the
stew
.
The
Riegger
,
with
its
Latin
hesitation
bounce
,
is
just
this
side
of
the
pale
;
like
his
sweet
,
attractive
Romanza
,
it
belongs
to
what
the
composer
called
his
``
Non-Dissonant
(
Mostly
)
''
category
of
works
.
The
Schuman
``
Chester
''
takes_off
from
an
old
William
Billings
tune
with
rousing
woodwind
and
brass
effect
.
All
these
-
potboilers
or
no
-
provided
a
welcome
breath
of
fresh
air
in
the
form
of
lively
,
colorful
,
unstuffy
works
well
suited
for
the
great
out-of-doors
.
It
was
nice
to
have
something
a_little
up-to-date
for
a
change
.
We
have
Alfredo_Antonini
to
thank
for
this
healthy
change
of
diet
as_well
as
the
lively
performances
of
the
Stadium_Symphony
.
A
woman
who
undergoes
artificial_insemination
against
the
wishes
of
her
husband
is
the
unlikely
heroine
of
``
A
Question
of
Adultery
''
,
yesterday
's
new
British
import
at
the
Apollo
.
Since
an
objective
viewer
might
well
conclude
that
this
is
not
a
situation
that
would
often
arise
,
the
film
's
extensive
discussion
of
the
problem
seems
,
at_best
,
superfluous
.
In
its
present
artless
,
low-budget
form
,
the
subject_matter
seems
designed
to
invite
censorial
wrath
.
With
Julie_London
enacting
the
central
role
with
husky-voiced
sincerity
,
the
longsuffering
heroine
is
at_least
attractive
.
The
explanation
offered
for
her
conduct
is
a
misguided
attempt
to
save
her
marriage
to
a
neurotic
husband
left
sterile
as
a
result
of
an
automobile
accident
.
Anthony_Steel
,
as
the
husband
,
is
a
jealous
type
who
argues
against
her
course
and
sues
for
divorce
,
labeling
her
action
adulterous
.
The
actor
plays
his
role
glumly
under
the
lurid
direction
of
Don_Chaffey
,
as
do
Basil_Sydney
as
his
unsympathetic
father
and
Anton_Diffring
as
an
innocent
bystander
.
After
a
protracted
,
hysterical
trial
scene
more
notable
for
the
frankness
of
its
language
than
for
dramatic
credibility
,
the
jury
,
to
no
one
's
surprise
,
leaves
the
legal
question
unresolved
.
When
the
husband
drops
the
case
and
returns
to
his
wife
,
both
seem
sorry
they
brought
the_matter
up
in_the_first_place
.
So
was
the
audience
.
For
its
final
change
of
bill
in
its
London
season
,
the
Leningrad_State_Kirov_Ballet
chose
tonight
to
give
one
of
those
choreographic
miscellanies
known
as
a
``
gala
program
''
at
the
Royal
Opera_House
,
Covent_Garden
.
No_doubt
the
underlying
idea
was
to
show
that
for
all
the
elegance
and
artistry
that
have
distinguished
its
presentations
thus_far
,
it
too
could
give
a
circus
if
it
pleased
.
And
please
it
did
,
in
every
sense
of
the
word
,
for
it
had
the
audience
shouting
much
of
the
time
in
a
manner
far
from
typical
of
London
audiences
.
At
the
end
of
the
program
,
indeed
,
there
was
a
demonstration
that
lasted
for
forty-five
minutes
,
and
nothing
could
stop
it
.
Alexandre_Livshitz
repeated
a
fantastic
technical
bit
from
the
closing
number
,
``
Taras_Bulba
''
,
but
even
then
there
was
a
substantial
number
of
diehards
who
seemed
determined
not
to
go_home
at_all
.
Only
a
plea
from
the
house
manager
,
John_Collins
,
finally
broke_up
the
party
.
But
for
all
the
manifest
intention
to
``
show_off
''
,
this
was
a
circus
with
a
difference
,
for
instead
of
descending
in
quality
to
what
is
known
as
a
popular
level
,
it
added
further
to
the
evidence
that
this
is
a
very
great
dancing
company
.
The
``
Taras_Bulba
''
excerpt
is
a
rousing
version
of
Gogol
's
Ukrainian
folk-tale
choreographed
by
Bo_Fenster
to
music
of
Soloviev-Sedoi
.
It
is
danced
by
some
thirty-five
men
and
no
women
,
and
it
contains
everything
in
the
books
-
lusty
comedy
,
gregarious
cavorting
,
and
tricks
that
only
madmen
or
Russians
would
attempt
to
make
the
human_body
perform
.
Yuri_Soloviev
,
Oleg_Sokolov
,
Alexei_Zhitkov
,
Lev_Sokolov
,
Yuri_Korneyev
and
Mr._Livshitz
were
the
chief
soloists
,
but
everybody
on
stage
was
magnificent
.
At
the
other
extreme
in
character
was
the
half-hour
excerpt
from
the
Petipa-Minkus
ballet
``
Bayaderka
''
,
which
opened
the
evening
.
What
a
man
this
Petipa
was
!
And
why
do
we
in
the
West
know
so
few
of
his
ballets
?
This
scene
is
a
``
white
ballet
''
in_which
a
lovelorn
hero
searches
for
his
departed
love
's
spirit
among
twenty-eight
extraordinarily
beautiful
``
shadows
''
who
can
all
dance
like
nothing
human
-
which
,
of_course
,
is
altogether
fitting
.
The
ensemble
enters
in
a
long
adagio
passage
that
is
of
fantastic
difficulty
,
as_well
as
loveliness
,
and
adagio
is
the
general
medium
of
the
piece
.
Its
ballerina
,
Olga_Moiseyeva
,
performs
simple
miracles
of
beauty
,
and
Ludmilla_Alexeyeva
,
Inna_Korneyeva
and
Gabrielle_Komleva
make_up
a
threesome
of
exquisite
accomplishments
.
Sergei_Vikulov
,
as
the
lone
male
,
meets
the
competition
well
with
some
brilliant
hits
,
but
the
work
is
designed
to
belong
to
the
ladies
.
The
middle
section
of
the
program
was
made_up
of
short
numbers
,
naturally
enough
of
unequal
merit
,
but
all_of
them
pretty
good
at
that
.
They
consisted_of
a
new
arrangement
of
``
Nutcracker
''
excerpts
danced
stunningly
by
Irina_Kolpakova
and
Mr._Sokolev
,
with
a
large
ensemble
;
a
winning
little
``
Snow_Maiden
''
variation
by
the
adorable
Galina_Kekisheva
;
two
of
those
poetic
adagios
in
Greek
veils
(
and
superb
esthetic
acrobacy
)
by
Alla_Osipenko
and
Igor_Chernishev
in_one_case
and
Inna_Zubkovskaya
and
Yuri_Kornevey
in
the
other
;
an
amusing
character
pas
de
cinq
called
``
Gossiping_Women
''
;
a
stirring
``
Flames
of
Paris
''
pas_de_deux
by
Xenia_Ter-Stepanova
and
Alexandre_Pavlovsky
,
and
a
lovely
version
of
Fokine
's
``
Le_Cygne
''
by
Olga_Moiseyeva
,
which
had
to
be
repeated
.
Vadim_Kalentiev
was
the
conductor
.
It
was
quite
an
evening
!
A
year
ago
today
,
when
the
Democrats
were
fretting
and
frolicking
in
Los_Angeles
and
John_F._Kennedy
was
still
only
an
able
and
ambitious
Senator
who
yearned
for
the
power
and
responsibility
of
the
Presidency
,
Theodore_H._White
had
already
compiled
masses
of
notes
about
the
Presidential
campaign
of
1960
.
As
the
pace
of
the
quadrennial
American
political
festival
accelerated
,
Mr._White
took
more
notes
.
He
traveled
alternately
with
Mr._Kennedy
and
with
Richard_M._Nixon
.
He
asked
intimate
questions
and
got
frank
answers
from
the
members
of_what
he
calls
the
candidates
'
``
in-groups
''
.
He
assembled
quantities
of
facts
about
the
nature
of
American
politics
in_general
,
as_well
as
about
the
day-to-day
course
of
the
closest
Presidential
election
in
American
history
.
Those
of
us
who
read
the
papers
may
think
we
know
a
good_deal
about
that
election
;
how
little
we
know
of_what
there
is
to
be
known
is
made
humiliatingly
clear
by
Mr._White
in
``
The
Making
of
the
President
1960
''
.
This
is
a
remarkable
book
and
an
astonishingly
interesting
one
.
What
might
have
been
only
warmed-over
topical
journalism
turns_out
to
be
an
eyewitness
contribution
to
history
.
Mr._White
,
who
is
only
a
competent
novelist
,
is
a
brilliant
reporter
.
His
zest
for
specific
detail
,
his
sensitivity
to
emotional
atmosphere
,
his
tireless
industry
and
his
crisply
turned
prose
all
contribute
to
the
effectiveness
of
his
book
.
As
a
dramatic
narrative
``
The
Making
of
the
President
1960
''
is
continuously
engrossing
.
And
as
an
introduction
to
American
politics
it
is
highly
educational
.
The
author
begins
this
volume
with
a
close-up
of
Mr._Kennedy
,
his
family
and
his
entourage
waiting
for
the
returns
.
He
then
switches
back
to
a
consideration
of
the
seven
principal
Presidential
hopefuls
:
five
Democrats
-
Senator_Hubert_H._Humphrey
,
Senator_Stuart_Symington
,
Senator_Lyndon_B._Johnson
,
Adlai_E._Stevenson
and
Mr._Kennedy
-
and
two
Republicans
-
Governor_Rockefeller
and
Mr._Nixon
.
Then
,
in
chronological
order
,
Mr._White
covers
the
primary
campaigns
,
the
conventions
and
the
Presidential
campaign
itself
.
In
the
process
he
writes
at_length
about
many
related
matters
:
the
importance
of
race
,
religion
,
local
tradition
,
bosses
,
organizations
,
zealous
volunteers
and
television
.
Mr._White
is
bluntly
frank
in
his
personal
opinions
.
He
frequently
cites
intimate
details
that
seem
to
come
straight
from
the
horse
's
mouth
,
from
numerous
insiders
and
from
Mr._Kennedy
himself
;
but
never
from
Mr._Nixon
,
who
looked_on
reporters
with
suspicion
and
distrust
.
``
Rarely
in
American
history
has
there
been
a
political_campaign
that
discussed
issues
less
or
clarified
them
less
''
,
says
Mr._White
.
Mr._Nixon
,
he
believes
,
has
no
particular
political
philosophy
and
mismanaged
his
own
campaign
.
Although
a
skillful
politician
and
a
courageous
and
honest
man
,
Mr._Nixon
,
Mr._White
believes
,
ignored
his
own
top-level
planners
,
wasted
time
and
effort
in
the
wrong
regions
,
missed
opportunities
through
indecision
and
damaged
his
chances
on
television
.
Mr._Nixon
is
``
a
broody
,
moody
man
,
given_to
long
stretches
of
introspection
;
he
trusts
only
himself
and
his
wife
.
He
is
a
man
of
major
talent
-
but
a
man
of
solitary
,
uncertain
impulses
.
He
was
above_all
a
friend
seeker
,
almost
pathetic
in
his
eagerness
to
be
liked
.
He
wanted
to
identify
with
people
and
have
a
connection
with
them
;
the_least
inspiring
candidate
since
Alfred_M._Landon
''
.
Mr._Kennedy
,
Mr._White
believes
,
``
had
mastered
politics
on
so
many
different
levels
that
no
other
American
could
match
him
''
.
Calm
,
dignified
,
composed
,
``
superbly
eloquent
''
,
Mr._Kennedy
always
knew
everything
about
everybody
.
He
enlisted
a
staff
of
loyal
experts
and
of
many
zealous
volunteers
.
Every
decision
was
made
quickly
on
sound
grounds
.
Efficiency
was
enforced
and
nothing
was
left
to
chance
.
Mr._Kennedy
did
not
neglect
to
cultivate
the
personal
friendship
of
reporters
.
Mr._White
admires
him
profoundly
and
leaves
no_doubt
that
he
is
a
Democrat
himself
who
expects
Mr._Kennedy
to
be
a
fine
President
.
Throughout
``
The_Making_of_a_President
''
Mr._White
shows
wonderfully
well
how
the
pressures
pile_up
on
candidates
,
how
decisions
have
constantly
to
be
made
,
how
fatigue
and
illness
and
nervous_strain
wear
candidates
down
,
how
subordinates
play
key
roles
.
And
he
makes
many
interesting
comments
.
Here
are
several
:
``
The
root
question
in
American
politics
is
always
:
Who
's
the
Man
to
See
?
To
understand
American
politics
is
,
simply
,
to
know
people
,
to
know
the
relative
weight
of
names
-
who
are
heroes
,
who
are
straw_men
,
who
controls
,
who
does
not
.
But
to
operate
in
American
politics
one
must
go
a
step
further
-
one
must
build
a
bridge
to
such
names
,
establish
a
warmth
,
a
personal
connection
''
.
``
In
the
hard
life
of
politics
it
is
well
known
that
no
platform
nor
any
program
advanced
by
either
major
American_party
has
any
purpose
beyond
expressing_emotion
''
.
``
All
platforms
are
meaningless
:
the
program
of
either
party
is
what
lies_in
the
vision
and
conscience
of
the
candidate
the
party
chooses
to
lead
it
''
.
Nostalgia
Week
at
Lewisohn_Stadium
,
which
had
begun
with
the
appearance
of
the
70
-
year-old
Mischa_Elman
on
Tuesday
night
,
continued
last
night
as
Lily_Pons
led
the
list
of
celebrities
in
an
evening
of
French
operatic
excerpts
.
Miss_Pons
is
certainly
not
70
-
no
singer
ever
is
-
and
yet
the
rewards
of
the
evening
again
lay
more
in
paying
tribute
to
a
great
figure
of
times
gone_by
than
in
present
accomplishments
.
The
better
part
of
gallantry
might
be
,
perhaps
,
to
honor
her
perennial
good_looks
and
her
gorgeous
rainbow-hued
gown
,
and
to
chide
the
orchestra
for
not
playing
in
the
same
keys
in_which
she
had
chosen
to
sing
.
No
orchestra
,
however
,
could
be
expected
to
follow
a
singer
through
quite
as_many
adventures
with
pitch
as
Miss_Pons
encountered
last
night
.
In_all
fairness
,
there
were
flashes
of
the
great
stylist
of
yesteryear
,
flashes
even
of
the
old
consummate
vocalism
.
One
such
moment
came
in
the
breathtaking
way
Miss_Pons
sang
the
cadenza
to
Meyerbeer
's
``
Shadow_Song
''
.
The
years
suddenly
fell_away
at
this
point
.
On_the_whole
,
however
,
one
must
wonder
at
just
what
it
is
that
forces
a
beloved
artist
to
besmirch
her
own
reputation
as
time
marches
inexorably
on
.
Sharing
the
program
was
the
young
French-Canadian
tenor
Richard_Verreau
,
making
his
stadium
debut
on
this
occasion
.
Mr._Verreau
began
shakily
,
with
a
voice
that
tended
toward
an
unpleasant
whiteness
when
pushed
beyond
middle
volume
.
Later_on
this
problem
vanished
,
and
the
``
Flower_Song
''
from
Bizet
's
``
Carmen
''
was
beautifully
and
intelligently
projected
.
