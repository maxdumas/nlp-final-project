Dan_Morgan
told
himself
he
would
forget
Ann_Turner
.
He
was
well
rid
of
her
.
He
certainly
did
n't
want
a
wife
who
was
fickle
as
Ann
.
If
he
had
married
her
,
he
'd
have
been
asking_for
trouble
.
But
all_of
this
was
rationalization
.
Sometimes
he
woke_up
in_the_middle
of
the
night
thinking_of
Ann
,
and_then
could
not
get_back
to
sleep
.
His
plans
and
dreams
had
revolved_around
her
so_much
and
for
so_long
that
now
he
felt
as
if
he
had
nothing
.
The
easiest
thing
would
be
to
sell_out
to
Al_Budd
and
leave
the
country
,
but
there
was
a
stubborn
streak
in
him
that
would
n't
allow
it
.
The
best
antidote
for
the
bitterness
and
disappointment
that
poisoned
him
was
hard_work
.
He
found
that
if
he
was
tired
enough
at
night
,
he
went_to_sleep
simply
because
he
was
too
exhausted
to
stay
awake
.
Each_day
he
found
himself
thinking
less
often
of
Ann
;
each_day
the
hurt
was
a_little
duller
,
a_little
less
poignant
.
He
had
plenty
of
work
to
do
.
Because
the
summer
was
unusually
dry
and
hot
,
the
spring
produced
a
smaller
stream
than
in
ordinary
years
.
The
grass
in
the
meadows
came
fast
,
now
that
the
warm
weather
was
here
.
He
could
not
afford
to
lose
a
drop
of
the
precious
water
,
so
he
spent
most_of
his
waking
hours
along
the
ditches
in
his
meadows
.
He
had
no
idea
how
much
time
Budd
would
give
him
.
In_any_case
,
he
had
no
intention
of
being
caught
asleep
,
so
he
carried
his
revolver
in
its
holster
on
his
hip
and
he
took
his
Winchester
with
him
and
leaned
it
against
the
fence
.
He
stopped
every
few
minutes
and
leaned_on
his
shovel
as
he
studied
the
horizon
,
but
nothing
happened
,
each_day
dragging_out
with
monotonous
calm
.
When
,
in
late
afternoon
on
the
last_day
in
June
,
he
saw
two
people
top
the
ridge
to_the_south
and
walk
toward
the
house
,
he
quit
work
immediately
and
strode
to
his
rifle
.
It
could
be
some
kind_of
trick
Budd
had
thought_up
.
No
one
walked
in_this
country
,
least_of_all
Ed_Dow
or
Dutch
Renfro
or
any
of
the
rest
of
the
Bar_B
crew
.
Morgan
watched
the
two
figures
for
a
time
,
puzzled
.
When
they
were
closer
and
he
saw
that
one
was
a
woman
,
he
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
.
He
cleaned
his
shovel
,
left
it
against
the
fence
,
picked_up
his
Winchester
,
and
started
downstream
.
His
visitors
had
crawled
through
the
south
fence
and
were
crossing
the
meadow
,
angling
toward
the
house
.
Now
he
saw
that
both
the
man
and
woman
were
moving
slowly
and
irregularly
,
staggering
,
as
if
they
found
it
a
struggle
to
remain
on
their
feet
.
Reaching
the
house
ahead
of
them
,
he
waited
with
his
Winchester
in
his
hands
.
They
crawled
through
the
north
fence
and
came_on
toward
him
,
and
now
he
saw
that
both
were
young
,
not
more_than
nineteen
or
twenty
.
They
were
dirty
,
their
clothes
were
torn
,
and
the
girl
was
so
exhausted
that
she
fell
when
she
was
still
twenty
feet
from
the
front_door
.
She
lay
there
,
making
no
effort
to
get_back
on
her
feet
.
The
boy
came
on
to
the
porch
and
sat_down
,
his
gaze
on
Morgan
as
if
half
expecting
him
to
shoot
and
not
really
caring
.
Morgan
hesitated
,
thinking
that
if
this
was
a
trick
,
it
was
a
good
one
.
He
did
n't
think
it
was
possible
for
this
couple
to
be
pretending
.
The
boy
licked
his
dry
lips
.
He
asked
,
``
Could
we
have
a
drink
''
?
Morgan
jerked
his
head
toward_the_front
door
.
``
In
the
kitchen
''
,
he
said
.
Leaning
his
Winchester
against
the
front
of
the
house
,
he
walked
to
the
girl
.
``
Get_up
.
There
's
water
in
the
house
''
.
She
did
n't
move
or
say
anything
.
Her
eyes
were
glazed
as
if
she
did
n't
hear
or
even
see
him
.
She
had
reached
a
point
at
which
she
did
n't
even
care
how
she
looked
.
Her
face
was
very
thin
,
and
burned
by
the
sun
until
much
of
the
skin
was
dead
and
peeling
,
the
new
skin
under_it
red
and
angry
.
Her
blond
hair
was
frowzy
,
her
dress
torn
in_several_places
,
and
her
shoes
were
so
completely
worn_out
that
they
were
practically
no
protection
.
It
must
have
hurt
her
even
to
walk
,
for
the
sole
was
completely
off
her
left
foot
and
Morgan
saw
that
it
was
bruised
and
bleeding
.
He
picked
her
up
,
sliding
one
hand
under
her
shoulders
,
the
other
under
her
knees
,
and
carried
her
into
the
house
.
She
was
amazingly
light
,
and
so
relaxed
in
his
arms
that
he
was
n't
even
sure
she
was
conscious
.
Any
lingering
suspicion
that
this
was
a
trick
Al_Budd
had
thought_up
was
dispelled
.
No
girl
would
go
this
far
to
fool
a
man
so
she
could
kill
him
.
Besides
,
she
had
a
sweet
face
that
attracted
him
.
He
put
her
down
on
the
couch
,
and
going_into
the
kitchen
,
saw
that
the
boy
had
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
the
table
.
They
looked
a
good_deal
alike
,
Morgan
thought
.
Both
had
blonde
hair
and
blue
eyes
,
and
there
was
even
a
faint
similarity
of
features
.
Morgan
filled
the
dipper
from
the
water
bucket
on
the
shelf
,
went_back
into
the
front_room
,
lifted
the
girl
's
head
,
and
held
the
edge
of
the
dipper
to
her
mouth
.
She
drank
greedily
,
and
murmured
,
``
Thank_you
''
,
as
he
lowered
her
head
.
He
stood
looking
down
at
her
for
a
moment
,
wondering
what
could
have
reduced
her
to
this
condition
.
He
had
seen
a_few
nester
wagons
go
through
the
country
,
the
families
almost
starving
to
death
,
but
he
had
never
seen
any
of
them
on_foot
and
as
bad
off
as
these
two
.
The
girl
dropped_off
to
sleep
.
Morgan
returned
to
the
kitchen
,
built
a
fire
,
and
carried
in
several
buckets
of
water
from
the
spring
which
he
poured
into
the
copper
boiler
that
he
had
placed
on
the
stove
.
He
brought
his
Winchester
in
from
the
front
of
the
house
,
then
faced
the
boy
.
``
Who
are
you
and
what
happened
to
you
''
?
he
asked
.
``
I
'm
Billy_Jones
''
,
the
boy
answered
.
``
That
's
my
wife
Sharon
.
We
ran_out
of
money
and
we
have
n't
eaten
for
two
days
''
.
``
What
are
you
doing
here
''
?
``
Are
we
in
Wyoming
''
?
Morgan
nodded
.
``
About
five
miles
north
of
the
line
''
.
Jones
sighed
as
if
relieved
.
``
We
've
been
looking_for
work
,
but
all
the
ranchers
have
turned
us
down
''
.
``
You
mean
you
dragged
your
wife
all_over
hell
's
half-acre
looking_for
work
''
?
Morgan
demanded
.
``
The
town
of
Buckhorn
's
only
about
six
miles
from
here
.
Why
did
n't
you
go
there
''
?
``
We
did
n't
want
town
work
''
,
Jones
said
.
``
This
is
a
mighty
empty
country
''
,
Morgan
said
.
``
There
's
only
one
more
ranch
three
miles
north
of
here
.
You
'd
have
starved
to
death
if
you
'd
missed
both
places
''
.
``
Then
we
're
lucky
we
got
here
.
Could
you
give
us
a
job
,
Mr.
-
-
''
.
``
Morgan
.
Dan_Morgan
''
.
He
was
silent
a
moment
,
thinking
he
could
use
a
man
this
time_of_year
,
and
if
the
girl
could
cook
,
it
would
give
him
more
time
in
the
meadows
,
but
he
knew
nothing
about
the
couple
.
They
might
kill
him
in
his
sleep
,
thinking
there
was
money
in
the
house
.
He
dismissed
the
possibility
at_once
.
The
girl
's
thin
face
haunted
him
.
It
was
n't
the
face
of
a
killer
.
He
was
n't
so
sure
about
the
boy
.
He
had
n't
shaved
for
several
weeks
,
his
sparse
beard
giving
his
face
a
pathetic
,
woebegone
expression
.
There
was
more
to
this
than
Jones
had
told
him
.
They
were
running
from
something
.
He
'd
be
an
idiot
to
let
them
stay
he
thought
,
but
he
could
n't
send
them
on
,
either
.
``
I
could
use
some
help
''
,
Morgan
said
finally
,
``
but
I
can
n't
afford
to
pay
you
anything
.
I
guess
you
'd
better
go_on
in
the
morning
''
.
``
We
'll
work
for
our
keep
''
,
the
boy
said
eagerly
.
``
I
've
been
mucking
in
a
mine
in
the
San_Juan
,
but
I
used_to
work
on
a
ranch
.
Sharon
,
she
's
cooked
in
a
restaurant
.
We
'll
work
hard
,
Mr._Morgan
''
.
``
I
'll
see
''
,
Morgan
said
.
``
Right_now
you
need
a
meal
and
a
bath
.
Your
wife
's
in
terrible
shape
''
.
``
I
know
''
,
Jones
said
dejectedly
.
Morgan
filled
the
fire
box
with
wood
again
,
then
started
supper
and
set
the
table
.
When
the
meal
was
ready
,
he
told
Jones
to
wash_up
,
and
going_into
the
front_room
,
woke
the
girl
.
He
said
,
``
I
've
got
some
supper
ready
''
.
She
rubbed
her
eyes
and
stretched
,
then
sat_up
,
her
hands
going_to
her
hair
.
``
I
'm
a
mess
''
,
she
said
,
and
suddenly
she
was
alarmed
.
``
Who
are
you
?
How
did
we
get
here
''
?
``
I
'm
Dan_Morgan
.
This
is
the
Rafter_M
.
You
fell_down
in_front
of
the
house
,
and
I
carried
you
in
.
I
gave
you
a
drink
and_then
you
went_to_sleep
''
.
``
Oh
''
.
She
stared
at
him
,
her
eyes
wide
as
she
thought_about
what
he
had
said
;
then
she
murmured
:
``
You
're
very
kind
,
Mr._Morgan
.
Do
you
take_in
all
the
strays
who
come_by
''
?
``
I
do
n't
have
many
strays
coming
to
my
front_door
''
,
he
said
.
``
Think
you
can
walk
to
the
table
''
?
``
Of_course
''
.
She
got
to
her
feet
,
staggered
,
and
almost
fell
.
He
caught
her
by
an
arm
and
helped
her
into
the
kitchen
.
She
sat_down
at
the
table
,
shaking
her
head
.
``
I
'm
sorry
,
Mr._Morgan
.
I
'm
usually
a
very
strong
woman
,
but
I
'm
awfully
tired
''
.
``
And
hungry
''
,
he
said
.
``
Start
in
.
It
's
not_much
of
a
meal
,
but
it
's
what
I
eat
''
.
``
Not_much
of
a
meal
''
?
the
girl
cried
.
``
Mr.
Morgan
,
it
's
the
best-looking
food
I
ever
saw
''
.
He
told
himself
he
had
never
seen
two
people
eat
so_much
.
When
they
were
finally
satisfied
,
Jones
said
,
``
I
think
he
's
going_to
give
us
work
''
.
The
grateful
way
she
looked
at
Morgan
made
him
ashamed
of
himself
.
When
he
saw
the
expression
in
her
eyes
,
he
knew
he
could
n't
send
them
on
.
She
said
,
``
I
guess
the
Lord
looks_out
for
fools
,
drunkards
,
and
innocents
''
.
Morgan
laughed
.
``
Which
are
you
''
?
``
We
're
not
drunkards
''
,
she
said
.
``
That
's
all
I
'm
sure
of
''
.
She
helped
him
with
the
dishes
,
then
he
brought
more
water
in
from
the
spring
before
it
got
dark
.
He
carried
the
tub
from
the
back
of
the
house
where
it
hung
from
a
nail
in
the
wall
.
He
said
:
``
You
'll
feel
a_lot
better
after
you
have
a
bath
.
Your
feet
are
in
bad
shape
,
Mrs._Jones
.
You
'll
have
to
go_to
town
to
see
the
doc
''
.
``
No
,
she
'll
be
all_right
''
,
Jones
said
quickly
.
``
I
mean
,
we
do
n't
have
any
way
to
get
there
and
we
can
n't
expect
you
to
quit
work
just
to
take
us
to
town
''
.
``
We
'll
see
''
,
Morgan
said
.
``
Could
you
find
me
a
needle
and
thread
''
?
the
girl
asked
.
``
My
dress
needs
some
work
on
it
''
.
He
nodded
and
,
going_into
the
bedroom
,
brought
a
needle
,
thread
,
and
scissors
.
He
said
:
``
I
'm
going_to_bed
''
.
He
nodded
at
the
door
in_front
of
him
.
``
That
's
my
spare
bedroom
.
The
bed
is
n't
made
,
but
you
'll
find
plenty
of
blankets
there
''
.
``
You
're
awfully
kind
''
,
the
girl
said
.
``
We
'll
pay
you
back
if
you
'll
let
us
.
Some
way
''
.
``
It
's
all_right
''
,
he
said
.
``
I
get_up
early
.
You
'd
better
sleep
''
.
Jones
followed
him
into
the
front_room
,
closing
the
door
behind
him
.
He
said
:
``
If
it
's
all_right
with
you
,
Mr._Morgan
,
I
'll
sleep
out
here
on
the
couch
.
We
have
n't
slept
together
since
we
started
.
I
just
can
n't
take
any
chances
on
getting
her
pregnant
,
and
if
we
were
sleeping
together
&
&
&
''
.
He
stopped
,
embarrassed
,
and
Morgan
said
,
``
I
understand
that
,
but
I
do
n't
savvy
why
you
'd
go_off
and
leave
your
jobs
in_the_first_place
''
.
``
We
got
fired
''
,
Jones
said
.
``
We
had
to
do
something
''
.
They
were
a
pair
of
lost
,
whipped
kids
,
Morgan
thought
as
he
went_to_bed
.
