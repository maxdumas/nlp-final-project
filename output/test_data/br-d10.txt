Men
need
unity
and
they
need
God
.
Care
must
be
taken
neither
to
confuse
unity
with
uniformity
nor
God
with
our
parochial
ideas
about
him
,
but
with
these
two
qualifications
,
the
statement
stands
.
The
statement
also
points
to
a
classic
paradox
:
The
more
men
turn
toward
God
,
who
is
not_only
in
himself
the
paradigm
of
all
unity
but
also
the
only
ground
on_which
human
unity
can
ultimately
be
established
,
the
more
men
splinter
into
groups
and
set
themselves
apart
from
one
another
.
To
be
reminded
of_this
we
need
only
glance
at
the
world
map
and
note
the
extent
to_which
religious
divisions
have
compounded
political
ones
,
with
a
resultant
fragmentation
of
the
human_race
.
Massacres
attending
the
partition
of
India
and
the
establishment
of
the
State
of
Israel
are
simply
recent
grim
evidences
of
the
hostility
such
divisions
can
engender
.
The
words
of
Cardinal_Newman
come
forcibly
to
mind
:
``
Oh
how
we
hate
one
another
for
the
love
of
God
''
!
The
source
of_this
paradox
is
not
difficult
to
identify
.
It
lies_in
institutions
.
Institutions
require
structure
,
form
,
and
definition
,
and
these
in_turn
entail
differentiation
and
exclusion
.
A
completely
amorphous
institution
would
be
a
contradiction_in_terms
;
to
escape
this
fate
,
it
must
rule
some
things
out
.
For
every
criterion
which
defines
what
something
is
,
at_the_same_time
proclaims
-
implicitly
if_not
openly
-
what
that
something
is
not
.
Some
persons
are
so
sensitive
to
this
truth
as
to
propose
that
we
do_away_with
institutions
altogether
;
in
the
present
context
this
amounts
to
the
advice
that
while
being
religious
may
have
a
certain
justification
,
we
ought
to
dispense_with
churches
.
The
suggestion
is
naive
.
Man
is
at_once
a
gregarious
animal
and
a
form-creating
being
.
Having
once
committed
himself
to
an
ideal
which
he
considers
worthwhile
,
he
inevitably
creates
forms
for
its
expression
and
institutions
for
its
continuance
.
To
propose
that
men
be
religious
without
having
religious
institutions
is
like
proposing
that
they
be
learned
without
having
schools
.
Both
eventualities
are
possible
logically
,
but
practically
they
are
impossible
.
As
much_as
men
intrinsically
need
the
unity
that_is
grounded
in
God
,
they
instrumentally
require
the
institutions
that
will
direct
their
steps
toward
him
.
Yet
the
fact
remains
that
such
institutions
do
set
men
at_odds
with
their
fellows
.
Is
there
any
way_out
of
the
predicament
?
The
only
way
that
I
can
see
is
through
communication
.
Interfaith
communication
need
not
be
regarded_as
an
unfortunate
burden
visited
upon
us
by
the
necessity
of
maintaining
diplomatic
relations
with
our
adversaries
.
Approached
creatively
,
it
is
a
high
art
.
It
is
the
art
of
relating
the
finite
to
the
infinite
,
of
doing
our
best
to
insure
that
the
particularistic
requirements
of
religious
institutions
will
not
thwart
God
's
intent
of
unity
among
men
more_than
is
minimally
necessary
.
In
a
certain
sense
,
interfaith
communication
parallels
diplomatic
communication
among
the
nation-states
.
What
are
the
pertinent
facts
affecting
such
communication
at
the
present
juncture
of
history
?
I
shall
touch_on
three
areas
:
personal
,
national
,
and
theological
.
By
personal
factors
I
mean
those
rooted
in
personality
structure
.
Some
interfaith
tensions
are
not
occasioned
by
theological
differences
at_all
,
but
by
the
need
of
men
to
have
persons
they
can
blame
,
distrust
,
denounce
,
and
even
hate
.
Such
needs
may
rise
to
pathological
proportions
.
Modern
psychology
has
shown
that
paralleling
``
the
authoritarian
personality
''
is
``
the
bigoted
personality
''
in_which
insecurity
,
inferiority
,
suspicion
,
and
distrust
combine
to
provide
a
target
for
antagonism
so
indispensable
that
it
will
be
manufactured
if
it
does
not
exist
naturally
.
Fortunately
the
number
of
pathological
bigots
appears
to
be
quite
small
,
but
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
think
that
more_than
a
matter
of
degree
separates
them
from
the
rest
of
us
.
To_some_extent
the
personal
inadequacies
that
prejudices
attempt
to
compensate
for
are
to
be
found
in_all
of
us
.
Interfaith
conflicts
which
spring
from
psychological
deficiencies
are
the_most
unfortunate
of
all
,
for
they
have
no
redeeming
features
whatsoever
.
It
is
difficult
to
say
what
can
be
done
about
them
except
that
we
must
learn
to
recognize
when
it
is
they
,
rather_than
pretexts
for
them
,
that
are
causing
the
trouble
,
and
do
everything
possible
to
nurture
the
healthy
personalities
that
will
prevent
the
development
of
such
deficiencies
.
While
the
personality
factors
that
aggravate
interfaith
conflict
may
be
perennial
,
nationalism
is
more
variable
.
The
specific
instance
I
have_in_mind
is
the
Afro-Asian
version
which
has
gained
prominence
only
in_this
second_half
of
the
twentieth
century
.
Emerging
from
the
two
centuries
of
colonial
domination
,
the
Afro-Asian
world
is
aflame
with
a
nationalism
that
has
undone
empires
.
No_less_than
twenty-two
nations
have
already
achieved
independence
since
World_War
2
,
,
and
the
number
is
growing
by
the
year
.
As
an
obvious
consequence
,
obstacles
to
genuine
interfaith
communication
have
grown
more
formidable
in
one
important
area
:
relations
between
Christians
and
non-Christians
in
these
lands
.
Colonialism
alone
would
have
been
able_to
make
these
difficulties
serious
,
for
Christianity
is
so
closely
tied
to
colonialism
in
the
minds
of
these
people
that
repudiation
of
the
one
has
tended
automatically
toward
the
repudiation
of
the
other
.
Actually
,
however
,
this
turns_out
to
be
only
part
of
the
picture
.
Nationalism
has
abetted
not_only
the
repudiation
of
foreign
religions
but
the
revival
of
native
ones
,
some
of_which
had
been_lying
in
slumber
for
centuries
.
The
truth
is
that
any
revival
of
traditional
and
indigenous
religion
will
serve
to
promote
that
sense
of
identity
and
Volksgeist
which
these
young
nations
very_much
need
.
Insofar
as
these
nations
claim
to
incarnate
traditions
and
ways_of_life
which
constitute
ultimate
,
trans-political
justifications
for
their
existence
,
such
people
are
inevitably
led
to
emphasize
the
ways
in_which
these
traditions
and
ways
are
theirs
rather_than
someone
else
's
.
All
this
works
severely
against
the
kind_of
cross-cultural
communication
for
which
Christian
missions
stand
.
Africans
and
Asians
tend
to
consider
not_only
missions
but
the
local
churches
they
have
produced
as
centers
and
agents
of
Western
culture
and
ideology
if_not
of
direct
political
propaganda
.
The
people
hardest
hit
by
this
suspicion
are
,
of_course
,
Christians
on
the
mainland
of
China
.
But
the
problem
extends
elsewhere
.
For_example
,
in
Burma
and
Ceylon
many
Buddhists
argue
that
Buddhism
ought
to
be
the
official
state
religion
.
In
1960
Ceylon
nationalized
its
sectarian
-
preponderantly
Christian
-
schools
,
to
the
rejoicing
of
most_of
its
7000000
Buddhists
and
the
lament
of
its
800000
Roman_Catholics
.
Again
,
India
has
imposed
formidable
barriers
against
the
entrance
of
additional
missionaries
,
and
fanatical
Hindu
parties
are
expected
to
seek
further
action
against
Christians
once
the
influence
making_for
tolerance
due_to
Nehru
and
his
followers
is
gone
.
The
progressive
closing
of
Afro-Asian
ears
to
the
Christian
message
is
epitomized
in
a
conversation
I
had
three
years
ago
while
flying
from
Jerusalem
to
Cairo
.
I
was
seated
next
to
the
director
of
the
Seventh_Day_Adventists
'
world
radio
program
.
He
said
that
on
his
tour
the
preceding
year
a
considerable
number
of
hours
would
have
been
available
to
him
on
Japanese
radio
networks
,
but
that
he
had
then
lacked
the
funds
to
contract
for
them
.
After
returning
to
the
United_States
and
raising
the
money
,
he
discovered
on
getting_back
to
Japan
that
the
hours
were
no_longer
available
.
It
was
not
that
they
had
been
contracted
for
during
the
interval
;
they
simply
could
no_longer
be
purchased
for
missionary
purposes
.
It
is
not
unfair
to
add
on
the
other
side
that
the
crude
and
almost
vitriolic
approach
of
certain
fundamentalist
sects
toward
the
cultures
and
religions
among
which
they
work
has
contributed
measurably
to
this
heightening
of
anti-Christian
sentiment
.
Ironically
,
these
are
the
groups
which
have
doubled
or
tripled
their
missionary
efforts
since
World_War
2
,
,
while
the
more
established
denominations
are
barely
maintaining
pre-war
staffs
.
Although
I
have
emphasized
the
barriers
which
an
aroused
nationalism
has
raised
against
relations
between
Christians
and
non-Christians
in
Asia
,
the
fact
is
that
this
development
has
also
widened
the
gulf
between
certain
Afro-Asian
religions
themselves
.
The
partition
of
India
has
hardly
improved
relations
between
Hindus
and
Muslims
;
neither
has
the
establishment
of
the
State
of
Israel
fostered
harmony
between
Muslims
and
Jews
.
I
turn
finally
to
several
theological
developments
.
Theocracy
reconsidered
.
The
modern_world
has
been
marked
by
progressive
disaffection
with
claims
to
divine
sanction
for
the
state
,
whatever
its
political
form
.
The
American_Constitution
was
historic
at
this
point
in
providing
that
``
Congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
''
.
One
of
our
foremost
jurists
,
David_Dudley_Field
,
has
gone
so_far
as
to
call
this
provision
``
the
greatest
achievement
ever
made
in
the
course
of
human
history
''
.
The
trend
throughout_the_world
's
religions
has
been
toward
a
recognition
of
at_least
the
practical
validity
of_this
constitutional
enactment
.
Pakistan
was
created
in
1947
expressly
as
a
Muslim
state
,
but
when
the
army
took_over
eleven
years
later
it
did
so
on
a
wave
of
mass
impatience
which
was
directed
in_part
against
the
inability
of
political
and
religious_leaders
to
think
their
way
through
to
the
meaning
of
Islam
for
the
modern
political
situation
.
``
What
is
the
point
''
,
Charles_Adams
reports
the
Pakistanis
as
asking
,
``
in
demanding
an
Islamic
state
and
society
if
no
one
,
not
even
the
doctors
of
the
sacred
law
themselves
,
can
say
clearly
and
succinctly
what
the
nature
of
such
a
state
and
society
is
''
?
The
current
regime
of
President_Mohammad_Ayub_Khan
is
determinedly
secular
.
And
while
the
nation
was
formerly
named
``
The
Islamic_Republic
of
Pakistan
''
,
it
is
now
simply
``
The
Republic
of
Pakistan
''
.
Comparable
trends
can
be
noted
elsewhere
.
The
new
regime
in
Turkey
is
intentionally
less
Muslim
than
its
predecessor
.
The
religious
parties
in
Israel
have
experienced
a
great
loss
of
prestige
in
recent
months
.
During
the
years
when
Israel
was
passing
from
crisis
to
crisis
-
the
Sinai
campaign
,
the
infusion
of
multitudes
of
penniless
immigrants
-
it
was
felt
that
the
purpose
of
national
unity
could
be
best
served
if
the
secular
majority
were
to
yield
to
the
religious
parties
.
Now
that
Israel
enjoys
relative
prosperity
and
a
reduction
of
tensions
,
the
secularists
are
less
disposed
to
compromise
.
And
in_this
country
Gustave_Weigel
's
delineation
of
the
line
between
the
sacral
and
secular
orders
during
the
last
presidential
campaign
served
to
provide
a
most
impressive
Roman_Catholic
defense
of
the
practical
autonomy
of
both
church
and
state
.
The
failure
at_that_time
of
the
Puerto
Rican
bishops
to
control
the
votes
of
their
people
added
a
ring
of
good_sense
to
Father_Weigel
's
theological
argument
.
Everywhere
there
seems
to
be
a
growing
recognition
of
the
fact
that
governments
and
religious
institutions
alike
are
too
fallible
and
corruptible
-
in
a
word
,
too
human
-
to
warrant
any
claim
of
maintaining
partnership
with
the
divine
.
Salvation
reconsidered
.
My
father
went
as
a
missionary
to
China
in
a
generation
that
responded
to
Student_Volunteer_Movement
speakers
who
held
watches
in
their
hands
and
announced
to
the
students
in
their
audiences
how
many
Chinese
souls
were
going_to
hell
each
second
because
these
students
were
not
over
there
saving
them
.
That
mention
of_this
should
bring
smiles
to
our
lips
today
is
as
clear
an
indication
as
we
could
wish
of
the
extent
to_which
attitudes
have
changed
.
I
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
Christians
have
adopted
the
liberal
assumption
,
so
prevalent
in
Hinduism
,
that
all
religions
are
merely
different
paths
to
the
same
summit
.
Leslie_Newbiggin
reflects
the
dominant
position
within
the
World_Council
of
Churches
when
he
says
,
``
We
must
claim
absoluteness
and
finality
for
Christ
and
His
finished
work
,
but
that
very
claim
forbids
us
to
claim
absoluteness
and
finality
for
our
understanding
of_it
''
.
Newbiggin
's
qualification
on
the
Christian
claim
is
of
considerable
significance
.
The
Roman_Catholic_Church
has
excommunicated
one
of
its
priests
,
Father_Feeney
,
for
insisting
that
there
is
no
salvation
outside
the
visible
church
.
In
mentioning
this
under
``
salvation
reconsidered
''
I
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
Roman_Catholic
doctrine
has
changed
in_this
area
but
rather
that
it
has
become
clearer
to
the
world
community
what
that
doctrine
is
.
