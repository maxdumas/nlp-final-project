With
this
evidence
in
mind
,
the
writer
began
to
plan
how
he
might
more
effectively
educate
the
married
students
in
his
functional
classes
.
Toward
the
end
of
the
semester
's
work
,
he
interviewed
every
married
class
member
at_great_length
.
He
found
,
as
he
had
suspected
,
a
general
consensus
that
perhaps
over
half
of
the
present
functionally
designed
course
was
not
really
functional
for
these
students
.
However
,
all
admitted
that
the
``
hind
sight
''
was
not
altogether
lost
.
In
their
own
words
,
it
had
aided
them
to
get
a
clearer
picture
of
how
they
had
gotten_into
their
marriages
,
and
perhaps
they
had
obtained
some
insights
on
why
certain
troubles
appeared
from_time_to_time
.
In_fact
,
they
went
so_far
as
to
caution
the
writer
that
if
he
attempted
to
design
a
section
exclusively
for
married
students
there
should
be
,
at
the
beginning
,
some
``
hind
sight
''
study
;
but
they
all
hastened
to
add
that
certainly
less
time
was
needed
on_it
than
presently
spent
.
All_of
them
felt
a
compelling
need
for
more
coverage
on
areas
that
could
be
only
lightly
touched_upon
in
a
general
survey
functional
course
.
A_few
were
doubtful
about
the
merits
of
an
exclusive
section
for
married
students
.
As
one
of
them
expressed
it
,
``
It
has
done
me
a
world
of
good
to
listen
to
the
nai
^
ve
questions
and
comments
of
these
not-yet-married
people
.
I
can
now
better
see
just
what
processes
provoked
certain
actions
from
me
in_the_past
.
Had
I
been
in
an
all-married
section
I
would
have
missed
this
,
and
I
believe
that
this
single
aspect
has
been
of
great
personal
value
to
me
''
.
This
comment
and_others
similar
to_it
,
would
seem
to
indicate
a
possible
justification
for
continuing
the
status_quo
.
But
the
weight
of
feeling
was
heavily
in_the_opposite_direction
.
Thus
,
the
writer
decided
to
hold
one
experimental
section
of
the
functional
preparation
for
marriage
course
in
the
spring
semester
of
1960
exclusively
for
persons
already
married
-
that_is
,
prerequisite
:
``
marriage
''
.
This
did
not
mean
that
married
students
could
not
enroll
in
other
``
mixed
''
sections
,
and
some
of
them
,
largely
because
of
scheduling
difficulties
,
did
.
But
only
those
already
married
could
enroll
in_this
one
section
.
In_addition
,
two
other
differences
in
the
two
types
of
sections
must
be
noted
.
1
)
The
regular
sections
do
not
allow
freshmen
;
this
one
did
.
This
action
was
rationalized
on
the
basis
of
a
small
survey
which
indicated
that
a
high
percentage
of
married
freshmen
women
on
our
campus
never
become
sophomores
.
Many_of
them
appear
to
drop_out
,
for
one
reason
or
another
.
By
permitting
freshman
students
we
might
extend
the
opportunity
for
such
a
course
to
some
individuals
who
otherwise
might
never
get
to
take
it
.
This
has
subsequently
been
verified
by
the
experience
.
2
)
Auditors
were
encouraged
.
In
the
regular
sections
they
have
always
been
more_or_less
discouraged
.
The
philosophy
has
been
that
if
they
could
find
the
time
to
attend
class
why
not
encourage
them
to
get
the
credit
and
perhaps
provide
an
incentive
to
do
the
work
more
effectively
.
Besides
,
auditors
do
not
count
on
faculty
load
with
the
same
weight
as
regularly
enrolled
students
.
But
in_this
one
section
we
welcomed
auditors
.
Why
?
For
no
particular
reason
,
other_than
that
the
writer
felt
it
might
-
just
might
-
encourage
both
mates
to
be
in_attendance
.
Many_of
the
men
on
our
campus
have
a
pretty
set
curriculum
,
especially
in
the
various
engineering
fields
,
with
few
electives
till
the
senior
year
.
Incidentally
,
it
needs
to
be
noted
that
because
auditors
were
permitted
the
section
began
increasing
in
numbers
each_week
,
until
at_last
it
swelled
to
such
proportions
that
this
``
free
''
auditing
policy
had
to
be
retracted
.
After_that
,
we
began
to
get
``
visitors
''
to
class
.
This
experimental
class
represented
quite
a
variety
of
students
.
It
ranged
from
a
freshman
woman
,
just
married
,
through
the
various
academic
growth
stages
,
including
one
senior-graduate
student
,
to
a
young
faculty_member
recently
married
to
a
senior
man
who
also
attended
.
It
ranged
from
those
with
no
children
,
through
students
in
various
stages
of
pregnancy
,
to
one
44
-
year-old
male
with
four
children
,
three
of
whom
were
teenagers
.
It
ranged
from
two
women
members
who
had
experienced
premarital
pregnancy
to
one
couple
twelve
years
married
and
seemingly
unable
to
conceive
.
One
might
digress
at
this
point
and
speculate
that
if
it
is
``
wise
''
to
create
special
sections
for
special
status
,
then
why
not
a
special
section
for
women
pregnant
before
marriage
,
and
one
for
44
-
year-old
men
with
teenage
children
,
and_so_on
.
Some
of
these
speculations
may
have
some
merit
,
others
are
somewhat
ambiguous
.
But
few
who
have
experienced
marriage
can
dispute
the
fact
that
the
focus
of
interpersonal
relationships
is
different
in
marriage
than
in
a
pre-marital
situation
.
The
writer
began
this
special
class
by
explaining
his
background
thinking
for
creating
such
a
section
in_the_first_place
.
He
made
it
clear
from_the_beginning
that
this
was
the
students
'
opportunity
,
and
that
the
future
destiny
of
such
groups
depended_on
favorable
results
from
this
one
.
He
did
build
a
framework
of
academic
``
respectability
''
,
and
one
which
did
not
encroach_upon
the
``
sacred
sovereignty
''
of
any
other
existing
campus
course
.
This
is
to
say
that
this
was
not
a
course
in
wise
buying
or
money
spending
methods
,
nor
a
course
in
how
to
raise
children
.
We
already
have
courses
covering
those
problems
,
and_so_on
.
But
within
that
framework
he
allowed_for
as
much
flexibility
as
possible
.
A
steering_committee
of
students
was
organized
on
the
first
day
whose
duty
it
was
to
be
alert
and
constantly
evaluate
and
re-evaluate
the
direction
and
pace
the
class
was
taking
.
The
writer
,
being
cognizant
through
his
interviews
of
the
reactions
of
previous
married
students
,
did
insist
on
there
being
included
some
``
hind
sight
''
material
.
But
the
greater
part
of
semester
time
was
actually
centered
around
the
attitudes
``
So
we
are
married
-
now
how
do
we
make
the
best
of_it
''
?
or
``
How
do
we
enrich
our
already
fine
marriage
''
?
Films
were
used
,
as
with
all
sections
,
but
with
one
big
difference
.
Our
campus
,
unfortunately
,
owns
no
films
.
Since
they
are
all
either
rented
or
borrowed
,
the
requested
dates
for
their
use
have
to
be
far
in_advance
.
The
writer
never
knew
from
week
to
week
just
where
the
section
might
be
.
For_example
,
the
steering_committee
might
announce
that
the
group
felt
a
topic
under
study
should
not
be
dropped
for
an
additional
week
as
there
was
still
too_much
of_it
untouched
.
Since
the
writer
had
established
this
democratic
procedure
in_the_beginning
he
had
to
go_along
with
their
decision
-
after
,
of_course
,
pointing_out
whether
he
thought
their
decision
was
a
wise
or
an
unwise
one
.
Thus
the
films
seen
as
they
came_in
(
coordinated
for
the
regular
sections
)
,
were
often
out
of
context
.
Nevertheless
,
the
writer
has
never
experienced
such
spontaneity
of
discussion
after
film
showings
.
Though
it
did
not
become
known
to
the
writer
for_some_time
,
a
nucleus
group
had
sprung_up
within
the
class
.
They
began
to
meet
in
the
evenings
and
carry_forward
various
discussions
they
felt
not
fully
enough
covered
in
class
.
From
a_few
students
this
group
gradually
increased
to
include
over
three-fourths
of
those
officially
enrolled
in
the
class
,
and
many
outsiders
as_well
.
Also
,
although
only
a_few
of
the
students
were
intimately
acquainted_with
each
other
in_the_beginning
,
most
reported
that
when
the
semester
ended
their
dearest
and
closest
campus
friendships
were
with
members
of_that
class
.
In_fact
,
they
often
revamped
their
social_activities
to
include
class
members
previously
unknown
.
Supplemental
outside
reading
reports
were
handled
just_as
in
the
other
sections
,
the
major
difference
being
that
there
was
a
noticeably
deeper
level
in
the
reported
outside
reading
by
the
married
group
.
These
students
,
although
they
might
read
various
articles
in
popular
magazines
,
more_often
chose
to
report
on
articles
found
in
the
journals
.
In_addition
to
the
noticeable
difference
in
outside
articles
,
there
was
a
considerable
difference
in
the
outside
books
they
read
.
Whereas
a
high
per_cent
of
the
regular
students
can
be
expected
to
read
other
texts
which
more_or_less
plow
the
same
ground
in
a_little
different
direction
,
the
married
students
chose
whole
books
on
specific
areas
and
went
into
much
greater
detail
in
their
areas
of
interest
.
Since
the
writer
had
not
noticed
this
characteristic
in
married
students
scattered
throughout
the
various
sections
previous
to
this
experiment
,
nor
,
as_a_matter_of_fact
,
in
those
who
were
continuing
in
``
single
sections
''
,
he
can
only
conclude
that
there
must
have
been
something
``
contagious
''
within
the
specific
group
which
caused
this
to
occur
.
In_the_main
,
this
course
took
the
following
directional
high
roads
:
1
)
A
great_deal
of
time
was
spent
on
processes
for
solving
marital
differences
.
This
was
not
a
search
for
a
``
magic
formula
''
,
but
rather
an
examination
of
basic_principles
pertaining
especially
to
all
types
of
communication
in
marriage
.
In_short
,
it
was
centered
around
learning
how
to
develop
a
more
sensitive
empathy
.
Not
until
the
group
was
satisfied
in_this
area
were
they
willing
to
venture
further
to
2
)
Specific
adjustment
areas
,
such_as
sex
,
in-laws
,
religion
,
finance
,
and_so_on
.
From
here
they
proceeded
to
3
)
These
same
areas
in_relation_to
their
own
future
family
life
stages
,
developing
these
to
the
extent
of
examining
various
crises
which
could
be
expected
to
confront
them
at_some_time
or
other
.
As
an
example
of_this
last
facet
,
there
were
some
lengthy
discussions
centered
around
bereavement
.
Mainly
these
were
concerned
with
the
possibility
of
the
death
of
one
parent
and
the
complication
of
living
with
the
survivor
afterward
,
but
the
possible
death
of
one
's
own
spouse
was
not
overlooked
.
Since
the
course
,
one
member
has
lost
her
husband
.
This
was
not
a
particularly
shocking
or
unexpected
thing
-
it
was
previously
known
to
her
that
it
might
happen
.
But
just
when
was
an
unknown
,
and
of_course
the
longer
it
did
not
happen
,
the
stronger
her
wish
and
belief
that
it
might
not
.
Since
her
bereavement
this
individual
has
reported
to
the
writer
on
numerous
occasions
about
how
helpful
the
class
discussions
were
to
her
in_this
adjustment
crisis
.
Quite
frequently
class
members
brought
questions
from
their
mates
at_home
.
These
were
often
carefully
written
out
with
a
great_deal
of
thought
behind
them
.
This
added
a
personal
zest
to
class
discussions
and
participation
.
Both
sexes
reported
that
the
discussions
on
sex
adjustment
within
marriage
were
extremely
enlightening
.
The
writer
sensed
a
much
freer
and
more
frank
discussion
,
especially
of_this
one
area
,
than
ever
before
.
He
felt
certain
for_the_first_time
in
his
teaching
experience
that
the
men
in
the
class
understood
that
orgasm
,
as
a
criterion
,
is
not_nearly
so
essential
for
a
satisfying
female
sexual
experience
as
most
males
might
think
.
This
was
probably
much
more
meaningful
because
all
the
women
in
the
class
emphasized
it
time_and_again
.
On_the_other_hand
,
the
women
class
members
appeared
to
reach
a
far
greater
understanding
than
have
women
members
in
other
sections
that
it
is
more
natural
for
males
as_a_group
to
view
sex
as
sex
rather_than
always
associating
it
with_love
as
most
women
seem
to
do
.
in
the
reproductive
area
it
could
be
readily
observed
that
all
felt
freer
to
discuss
things
than
students
had
previously
in
``
mixed
''
marital_status
sections
.
Perhaps
this
was
related
to
the
fact
that
all
were
in
on_it
to_some_extent
.
Never
in
other
sections
has
there
been
the
opportunity
for
the
genuine
down-to-earth
discussions
about
the
feelings
of
both
spouses
during
various
stages
of
pregnancy
.
There
was
a
particularly
marvelous
opportunity
for
study
in_this
area
since
almost
every
stage
of
pregnancy
was
represented
,
from
a
childless
couple
to
and
including
every
trimester
.
In_fact
,
we
had
one
birth
before
the
end
of
the
course
,
and
another
student
had_to
take
the
final
examiantion
a
week
early
,
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
.
There
was
also
one
spontaneous
abortion
during
the
semester
.
