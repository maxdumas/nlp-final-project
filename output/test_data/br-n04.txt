``
So
it
was
n't
the
earthquake
that
made
him
return
to
his
village
''
!
``
No
.
Now
dammit
,
I
do
n't
want
to
go
into
any_more
explanations
.
Here
comes
Jason
.
Keep
this
to
yourself
''
.
Reverend_Jason
,
looking
worried
,
hurried
toward
us
.
``
Anything
wrong
,
cap
'
n
?
The
men
seem
to
think
so
''
.
``
Dirion
found
a
large
war
party
south
of
us
.
They
'll
probably
attack
at
dawn
''
,
Montero
said
.
He
brushed
past
the
clergyman
and
walked
into
the
center
of
the
camp
.
Using
his
hands
as
a
trumpet
he
shouted
,
``
Fort_up
!
Fort_up
!
There
's
a
large
war
party
on
their
way
''
!
For
a
second
,
engages
,
cooks
,
voyageurs
appeared
struck
dumb
.
Then
Little_Billy
began
shouting
orders
to
round_up
the
ponies
and
fill
the
water
buckets
and
for
the
cooks
to
hurry
up
with
the
meal
.
They
all
flew
into
action
.
``
That
was
a
terrible
thing
to
do
''
,
I
said
to
Oso
.
The
Aricaras
treated
us
like
friends
.
And
here
all_the_time
you
knew
the
Sioux
would
be
using
our
rifles
on
them
!
God
,
what
a
world
you
people
live
in
``
.
Oso
gave
me
an
unruffled
look
.
``
Old_Knife
's
got
the
largest
war
party
ever
seen
on
the
river
''
,
he
said
calmly
.
``
What
would
you
have
done
in
Montero
's
moccasins
?
Let
Old_Knife
come_up
and
kill
you
and
your
people
,
or
would
you
steer
him
on
someone
else
''
?
He
shook
his
head
.
``
Mr.
Manuel
did
that
in
the
war
.
That
's
why
the_British
never
got
the
tribes
to
fight
for
the
King
.
Mr._Manuel
whispered
in
the
ears
of
the
Sioux
that
the
Cheyennes
were
comin
'
to
raid
'
em
for
their
horses
.
Then
he
went_on
to
the
Cheyennes
and
told
them
that
the
Sioux
was
goin
'
to
move_up
.
He
did
that
with
all
the
Nations
.
Hell
,
they
were
fightin
'
each
other
so
hard
they
had
no
time
for
anyone
else
.
The
War_Department
wrote
Mr._Manuel
a
letter
and
said
he
was
a
hero
.
I
saw
that
letter
.
He
carried
it
in
a_little
wallet
made
of
fish
skin
''
.
``
But
that
was
war
''
,
I
said
.
``
There
's
no
war
on
now
''
.
``
You
're
wrong
,
Matt
.
In_this
country
there
's
a
war
on
every
time
the
grass
turns
green
.
First
it
was
the
Nations
against
themselves
,
then
it
was
them
against
the
whites
.
And
it
's
goin
'
to
go_on
like
this
year
after
year
until
the
white
people
take_over
this
land
''
.
I
remember
being
told
it
would
happen
so
fast
people
would
think
it
took_place
overnight
.
``
That
's
why
this
company
's
important
.
Once
we
get_over
the
mountains
others
will
come_along
.
That
's
why
the
Trust
do
n't
want
us
to
make_it
.
That
bastard
Chambers

-
Old_Knife
's
not

only

'll

do
his
dirty
work
!
Before
we
get_through
he
'll
have
the
Blackfeet

for
our
hair
and
our
goods
.
Well
,
talkin
'
ai
n't
goin
'
to
help
-
let
's
fort_up
''
!
As
I
dug_in
behind
one
of
the
bales
we
were
using
as
protection
,
I
grudgingly
found
myself
agreeing
with
Oso
's
logic
,
especially
when
I
imagined
what
would
have
happened
to
Missy
if
Old_Knife
's
large
party
of
screeching
warriors
had
overrun
our
company
.
For
,
unlike
the
Sioux
and
the
Crows
,
the
Aricaras
are
not
great
horsemen
,
nor
are
they
aggressive
like
the
savage
Blackfeet
.
More
of
an
agricultural
nation
,
they
have
relied_on
their
warriors
only
for
defense
and
for
survival
in
the
endless
wars
of
the
plains
.
Still
,
I
was
disgusted
with
myself
for
agreeing
with
Montero
's
methods
.
Surprisingly
,
he
had
told
the
others
what
he
had
done
.
In
the
brief
moment
I
had
to
talk
to
them
before
I
took
my
post
on
the
ring
of
defenses
,
I
indicated
I
was
sickened
by
the
methods
men
employed
to
live
and
trade
on
the
river
.
``
I
think
Montero
did
right
''
,
Amy
said
firmly
.
``
Let
the
savages
kill
each
other
What
do
we
care
''
?
Reverend_Jason
was
understandably
bitter
.
``
It
was
a
terrible
thing
to
do
.
Those
little
children
''
.
But
Oso
replied
calmly
,
``
Trouble
ai
n't
easy
to
dodge
out
in_this
country
,
rev_'_rend
''
.
Gray_Eyes
attacked
our
camp
just_as
the
first
pink
threads
stitched
together
the
hills
and
the
sky
.
Our
camp
was
in_the_center
of
a
wide
valley
.
Montero
had
set_up
a
strong
position
,
using
every
bale
and
box
we
had
in_addition
to
barricades
of
logs
and
brush
.
He
had
ordered
the
ponies
brought
inside
the
fortified
circle
and
had
assigned
Pierre
and
a
band
of
picked
engages
the
job
of
trying
to
keep
them
steady
under_fire
.
The
pony
herd
was
the
one
flaw
in
our
defense
;
the
Rees
undoubtedly
would
try
to
cut_down
as_many
of
the
animals
as
possible
.
Wildly
bucking
horses
would
make
the
position
difficult
to
defend
against
charging
warriors
.
The
cooks
had
prepared
one
of
the
best
meals
we
'd
had
in
a
long_time
,
and
on
Montero
's
orders
had
baked
enough
bread
to
last
the
day
.
Buckets
were
filled
,
the
herd
fed
and
watered
.
The
worst
part
had
been
the
waiting
;
although
we
did
n't
expect
the
attack
before
dawn
,
the
long
cloudy
night
,
filled
with
the
sounds
of
the
industrious
insects
,
seemed
endless
.
Coyotes
and
hunting
wolves
sounded
like
signaling
Indian
scouts
,
the
whinny
of
a
restless
pony
made
one
's
skin
crawl
.
Oso
slept
unconcernedly
,
his
rifle
cradled
in
his
arms
;
I
did
n't
catch_a_wink
.
Every
time
I
closed
my
eyes
,
I
saw
Gray_Eyes
rushing
at
me
with
a
knife
.
It
was
a
relief
when
they
finally
came
.
They
poured
through
the
opening
in
the
valley
,
then
spread_out
in
a
long
line
to
come
at
us
,
brandishing
their
lances
and
filling
the
morning
with
their
spine-chilling
scalp
cry
.
``
Oso
''
,
Montero
called
``
I
'll
get
Gray_Eyes
''
.
``
That
'll
be
a
pleasure
to
see
''
,
the
big
black
murmured
as
he
stared
down
the
barrel
of
his
rifle
.
``
Hold
your
fire
''
,
Montero
was
shouting
.
``
Wait
until
my
shot
.
I
'll
shoot
the
first
man
who
does
n't
''
.
I
could
see
them
in
my
sights
.
They
were
about
a
mile
off
;
under
me
the
ground
quivered
slightly
.
At_first
they
were
only
feathers
and
dark
indistinguishable
faces
and
bodies
,
hunched_over
their
horses
'
heads
.
Gradually
they
emerged
as
men
.
Gray_Eyes
was
in_the_lead
.
His
face
was
split
by
a
vermilion
streak
,
his
eyes
were
pools
of
white
;
jagged
red
and
black
medicine
symbols
covered
his
chest
.
He
was
naked
except
for
a
clout
.
Next
to
him
was
a
young
boy
I
was
sure
had
sat
near
me
at
one
of
the
trading
sessions
.
His
mouth
was
open
,
his
neck
corded
with
the
strain
of
his
screams
.
I
found
his
chest
in
my
sights
.
It
had
a
red
circle
.
The
circle
came
nearer
and
nearer
.
My
God
,
how
long
is
he
going_to
wait
,
I
thought
.
Montero
's
rifle
cracked
.
At_first
I
thought
he
had
missed
.
Gray_Eyes
remained
erect
.
The
feathered
lance
was
still
above
his
head
.
As
he
started
to
slump
over
,
another
warrior
swung
him
onto
his
horse
.
I
squeezed
the
trigger
.
At
the
last
second
I
dropped
my
sights
from
the
bare
chest
and
bright
red
circle
to
the
chest
of
his
pony
.
I
saw
the
pony
fall
like
a
stone
and
the
young
warrior
flew
over
its
head
,
bouncing
like
a
rubber
ball
.
He
started
to
run
but
Oso
's
shot
caught
him
on
the
wing
.
He
jerked
once
in
the
grass
and
lay
still
.
``
If
you
're
goin
'
to
kill
'
em
-
kill
'
em
''
!
Oso
growled
.
What
else
he
said
was
lost
in
the
rattle
of
gunfire
on_all_sides
.
The
Aricaras
broke
under
the
devastating
fire
,
wheeled
and
retreated
.
``
Lead_up
!
Lead_up
!
They
'll
be
back
''
!
Montero
was
shouting
.
Far
up
the
valley
I
could
see
the
Rees
circling
and
reorganizing
.
Out
in_front
of
our
walls
the
grass
was
covered
with
dead
and
dying
men
,
war
shields
,
lances
,
blankets
and
wounded
and
dead
horses
.
The
morning
air
was
filled
with
the
sweetish
odor
of
new-spilled
blood
,
the
acrid
stench
of
frightened
horses
,
and
the
bitterness
of
burned
powder
.
A
horse
screamed
as
it
twisted
from
side
to
side
in
a
frenzy
.
A
rifle
cracked
;
the
square
head
fell_over
.
One
of
the
warriors
suddenly
leaped
to
his
feet
and
began
running
across
the
valley
to
the
trees
that
lined
the
small
creek
.
His
legs
pumped
furiously
,
his
long
black
hair
streamed
out
behind
him
.
There
was
a
ragged
volley
.
He
was
dead
before
he
hit
the
ground
.
``
For
Christ
's
sake
,
do
n't
waste
your
powder
on
one
of
'
em
''
!
Montero
shouted
furiously
.
``
Wait
for
the
charge
!
The
charge
,
I
tell
you
''
!
The
sharp
cries
at
the
end
of
the
valley
were
faint
.
They
grew
louder
as
the
Indians
charged
again
.
I
could
see
their
faces
glistening
with
sweat
and
bear_grease
,
their
mouths
open
,
shouting
their
spine-chilling
cries
.
``
Gray_Eyes
is
back
''
,
Montero
said
.
The
war
captain
had
been
badly
wounded
and
was
fighting
to
hold
his
seat
.
I
could
see
the
blood
running
down
his
chest
.
He
was
riding
between
two
warriors
,
who
held
him
erect
when
he
started
to
slump
.
I
forgot
to
aim
.
In
my
sights
I
watched
him
looming
bigger
and
bigger
.
Montero
's
shot
had
caught
him
high
in
the
chest
;
there
was
no_doubt
he
was
dying
.
Again
we
waited
for
Montero
.
This
time
he
delayed
so_long
that
some
of
the
engages
shouted
frantically
,
but
they
held
their
fire
.
The
horses
were
only
several
lengths
away
when
he
fired
.
The
bullet
flung
Gray_Eyes
from
his
horse
.
Our
rolling
volley
swept
most_of
the
other
riders
from
their
mounts
.
But
a_few
reached
our
wall
.
I
heard
the
whir
of
an
ax
and
a
Canadian
's
face
burst
apart
in
a
bloody
spray
.
I
saw
Little_Billy
rise
and
fire
almost
point
blank
and
an
Indian
's
face
became
shattered
flesh
and
bone
.
A
second
leaped
from
his
horse
to
the
top
of
the
bale
,
firing
four
arrows
in
such
rapid
succession
it
did
n't
seem
possible
they
were
in
flight
.
Men
screamed
.
Oso
reached
up
,
jerked
the
buck
from
the
bale
and
snapped
his
neck
.
Other
Indians
were
running
at
the
ponies
,
shrilling
and
waving
blankets
.
Reverend_Jason
got
one
,
the
Canadians
the
others
.
I
saw
the
clergyman
kneel
for
a
moment
by
the
twitching
body
of
the
man
he
had
shot
,
then
run
back
to
his
position
.
The
ponies
were
almost
uncontrollable
.
The
pall
of
dust
they
raised
made
it
difficult
to
see
when
the
Aricaras
charged
again
.
This
time
more
of
them
hurdled
the
barrier
.
A
small
Indian
dived
at
Montero
,
who
caught
him
with
a
swift
upward
stroke
of
his
rifle_butt
.
It
sounded
like
a
man
kicking
a
melon
.
Above
me
a
dark
rider
was
whipping
his
pony
with
a
quirt
in
an
attempt
to
hurdle
the
bales
.
Although
my
shot
killed
his
horse
,
he
rolled
off
the
bale
on
top
of
me
.
I
could
smell
woodsmoke
,
grease
,
and
oil
.
His
eyes
were
dark
,
fluid
,
fearful
,
and
he
gave
a
sigh
as
my
knife
went_in
.
Coming
over
the
wall
he
had
seemed
like
a
hideous
devil
.
Now
under
me
I
could
see
him
for
what
he
really
was
,
a
boy
dressed_up
in
streaks
of
paint
.
The
Aricaras
made
one
last
desperate
charge
.
It
was
pitiful
to
see
the
thin
ranks
of
warriors
,
old
and
young
,
wheeling
and
twisting
their
ponies
frantically
from
side
to
side
only
to
be
tumbled
bleeding
from
their
saddles
by
the
relentless
slam
,
slam
of
the
cruelly
efficient
Hawkinses
.
Others
,
badly
wounded
,
gripped
hands
in
manes
,
knees
in
bellies
,
held_on
as
long
as
possible
and_then
,
weak
from
ghastly
wounds
,
slipped
sideways
,
slowly
,
almost
thoughtfully
,
to
be
broken
under
the
slashing
hoofs
.
Some
gracefully
soared
from
the
backs
of
their
wounded
,
screaming
mounts
to
make
one
last
defiant
charge
before
the
lead
split
their
hearts
or
tore
their
guts
.
None
of
them
reached
our
walls
again
.
The
few
survivors
grudgingly
turned_away
.
In
the
distance
we
could
hear
the
drums
and
the
wail
of
the
death
song
.
