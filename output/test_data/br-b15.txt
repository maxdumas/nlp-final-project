The
Providence_Journal
editorial
(
Jan.
25
)
entitled
``
East_Greenwich
Faces
a
Housing_Development
Problem
''
points
to
a
dilemma
that
faces
communities
such_as
ours
.
Your
suggested
solution
,
it
seems
to
me
,
is
grossly
oversimplified
and
is
inconsistent
with
your
generally
realistic
attitude
toward
,
and
endorsement
of
,
sound
planning
.
First_of_all
there
is
ample
area
in
East_Greenwich
already
zoned
in
the
classification
similar
to_that
which
petitioner
requested
.
This
land
is
in
various
stages
of
development
in
several
locations
throughout
the
town
.
The
demand
for
these
lots
can
be
met
for_some_time
to
come
.
This
would
seem
to
indicate
that
we
are
trying
neither
``
to
halt
an
influx
of
migrants
''
nor
are
we
``
setting_up
such
standards
for
development
that
only
the
well-to-do
could
afford
to
buy
land
and
build
in
the
new
sites
''
.
What
we
are
attempting
to
do
is
achieve
and
maintain
a
balance
between
medium
density
and
low_density
residential
areas
and
industrial
and
commercial
development
.
It
is
in_fact
entirely
consistent_with
your
suggestion
of
modest
industrial
development
to
help
pay
governmental
costs
.
Bostitch
,
Inc.
is
approximately
half_way
through
a
10
-
year
exemption
of
their
real_estate
tax
.
The
wisdom
of
granting
such
tax
exemptions
is
another
matter
,
but
this
particular
instance
is
,
in
my
opinion
,
completely
satisfactory
.
The
1960
tax
book
for
East_Greenwich
indicates
a
valuation
for
this
property
in_excess
of
two
million
dollars
.
With
our
current
$
3
per
hundred
tax_rate
,
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
this
will
qualify
when
you
suggest
a
community
should
``
try
to
develop
a
modest
industrial
plant
''
as
the
best
way
to
meet
these
problems
.
In_order_to
attract
additional
industry
that
is
compatible
with
this
community
it
is
all
the
more
important
to
present
to
the
industrial
prospect
an
orderly
balance
in
the
tax
structure
.
As
this
tax_base
grows
so
then
can
your
medium
and
low_density
residential
areas
grow
.
Mr._Richard_Preston
,
executive_director
of
the
New_Hampshire
State_Planning
and
Development_Commission
,
in
his
remarks
to
the
Governors_Conference
on
Industrial_Development
at
Providence
on
October
8
,
1960
,
warned
against
the
fallacy
of
attempting
to
attract
industry
solely
to
reduce
the
tax_rate
or
to
underwrite
municipal
services
such_as
schools
when
he
said
:
``
If
this
is
the
fundamental
reason
for
a
community
's
interest
or
if
this
is
the
basic
approach
,
success
if
any
will
be
difficult
to
obtain
''
.
He
went_on
to
say
:
``
In_the_first_place
,
industry
per_se
is
not
dedicated_to
the
role
of
savior
of
foundering
municipalities
.
It
is
not
in
business
for_the_purpose_of
absorbing
increased
municipal
costs
no_matter_how
high
a
purpose
that
may
be
''
.
While
Councilman_Olson
cited
the
anticipated
increase
in
school
costs
in
answer
to
a
direct
question
from
a
taxpayer
,
the
impact
upon
a
school_system
does
not
have
to
be
measured
only
in
increased
taxes
to
find
alarm
in
uncontrolled
growth
.
We
in
East_Greenwich
have
the
example
of
two
neighboring
communities
,
one
currently
utilizing
double
sessions
in
their
schools
,
and
the
other
facing
this
prospect
next
year
.
It
has
already
been
reported
in
your
newspapers
that
the
East_Greenwich_School_Committee
is
considering
additions
to
at_least
one
elementary_school
and
to
the
high_school
to
insure
future
accommodations
for
a
school
population
that
we
know
will
increase
.
If
they
are
to
be
commended
for
foresight
in
their
planning
,
what
then
is
the
judgment
of
a
town
council
that
compounds
this
problem
during
the
planning
stage
?
Where
then
is
the
sound
planning
and
cooperation
between
agencies
within
the
community
that
you
have
called_for
in
other
editorials
?
I
submit
that
it
cannot
be
dismissed
simply
by
saying
we
are
not
facing
the
facts
of
life
.
The
``
fruitful
course
''
of
metropolitanization
that
you
recommend
is
currently
practiced
by
the
town
of
East_Greenwich
and
had
its
inception
long
before
we
learned
what
it
was
called
.
For_example
:
The
East_Greenwich
Police_Department
utilizes
the
radio
transmission
facilities
of
the
Warwick
Police_Department
,
thereby
eliminating
duplication
of
facilities
and
ensuring
police
coordination
in
the
Cowessett-East_Greenwich-Potowomut
area
of
the
two
communities
.
The
East_Greenwich_Fire_District
services
parts
of
Warwick
as_well
as
East_Greenwich
.
The
taxpayers
of
East_Greenwich
appropriate
sums_of_money
,
as
do
other
Kent_County
communities
,
for
the
support
of
the
Kent_County_Memorial_Hospital
,
a
regional
facility
.
The
East_Greenwich_Free_Library
receives
financial
support
from
the
town
of
East_Greenwich
and
the
City
of
Warwick
to
supplement
its
endowment
.
Feelers
were
put_out
last
year
to
the
City
of
Warwick
,
as
reported
in
your
newspapers
,
suggesting
investigation
of
a
common
rubbish
disposal
area
to
service
the
Potowomut
and
Cowessett
areas
of
Warwick
along
with
East_Greenwich
.
East_Greenwich
was
one
of
the
first
Rhode_Island
towns
to
enter
into
contract
agreement
with
the
Rhode_Island
Development_Council
for
planning
services
we
could
not
provide
for
ourselves
.
The
education
program
for
retarded
children
conducted
by
the
East_Greenwich
school_system
has
pupils
from
at_least
one
neighboring
community
.
I
feel
compelled
to
write
this
because
I
am
greatly
concerned
with
the
problem
of
community
growth_rate
and
the
relation
between
types
of
growth
in
a
town
such_as
East_Greenwich
.
I
believe
it
is
an
area
in_which
professional
planners
have
failed
to
set
adequate
guide
posts
;
and
yet
they
cannot
ignore
this
problem
because
it
concerns
the
implementation
of
nearly
all
the
planning
programs
they
have
devised
.
These
programs
are
volumes
of
waste
paper
and
lost
hours
if
the
citizens
of
a
community
must
stand
aside
while
land
developers
tell
them
when
,
where
,
and
in_what_manner
the
community
shall
grow
.
We
have
far
less
to
fear
in
the
migrant
family
than
we
have
in
the
migrant
developer
under
these
conditions
.
Until
professional
planners
meet
this
situation
squarely
and
update
the
concepts
of
zoning
in
a
manner
acceptable
to
the
courts
,
I
hope
we
in
East_Greenwich
can
continue
to
shape
our
own
destiny
.
I
would
like
very_much
,
on
behalf
of
my
husband
and
myself
,
to
send
our
eternal
thanks
to
all
the
wonderful
people
responsible_for
the
Gabrielle_Fund
.
It
is
indeed
true
,
as
stated
in
the
famous
novel
of
our
day
,
``
For
Whom
the
Bell
Tolls
''
,
that
``
no
man
is
an
island
,
entirely
of
itself
;
every
man
is
a_piece
of
the
continent
,
a
part
of
the
main
''
.
Thanks
to
the
generosity
of
Mr._Irving_J._Fain
,
president
of
the
Temple_Beth_El
;
Rev._DeWitt_Clemens
,
pastor
of
the
Mathewson_Street
Methodist_Church
;
Mr._Felix_Miranda
,
of
the
Imperial_Knife_Co.
;
and
to
Mrs._Rozella_Switzer
,
regional
director
of
The
National_Conference
of
Christians
and
Jews
,
who
asked
them
to
serve
as
a
committee
for
the
fund
.
It
is
through
them
that
we
have
become
aware
of
the
divine
humanity
in
man
,
and
therefore
,
that
most
people
are
noble
,
helpful
and
good
.
Bless
you
my
friends
,
for
it
is
through
love
and
service
that
brotherhood
becomes
a
reality
.
I
am
a
sophomore
at
Mount_Pleasant
High_School
.
My
future
plans
are
to
become
a
language
teacher
.
Of_course
,
having
this
desire
,
I
am
very
interested
in
education
.
A_few
weeks
ago
,
I
read
in
the
Bulletin
that
there
were
to
be
given
Chinese
classes
in
Cranston
.
The
article
also
said
that
a
person
had
to
be
18
years
old
or
over
,
and
must
not
be
going_to
high_school
to
attend
these
classes
.
The
following
week
,
I
read
in
the
Sunday
paper
that
the
students
of
Russia
begin
European
and
Asian
languages
in
the
seventh
grade
.
I
wish
you
could
see
the
situation
as
I
see
it
.
If
Russian
pupils
have
to
take
these
languages
,
how_come
American
students
have
a
choice
whether
or
not
to
take
a
language
,
but
have
to
face
so
many
exceptions
?
I
do
not
think
that
America
is
like
Russia
,
not
in_the_least
!
I
am
proud
of
my
country
,
the
small
city
I
live
in
,
my
wonderful
parents
,
my
friends
and
my
school
;
but
I
am
also
a
young
,
able
and
willing
girl
who
wants
to
study
the
Chinese
language
but
is
not
old
enough
.
Then
people
wonder
why
Russian
pupils
are
more
advanced
than
American
students
.
Well
,
there
lies
your
answer
.
At
the
height
of
the
first
snowstorm
we
had
,
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
get
medical
attention
needed
during
an
emergency
.
However
,
the
East_Providence_Rescue
Squad
made
its
way
through
to
my
home
in_time
of
desperation
.
Words
cannot
tell
of
the
undivided
attention
and
comfort
their
service
gave
to
me
.
The
concern
they
felt
for
me
was
such_as
I
shall
never
forget
and
for
which
I
will
always
be
grateful
.
The
rescue
squad
is
to
be
praised
immensely
for
the
fine
work
they
do
in
all
kinds
of
weather
.
Had
they
not
gotten
me
to
the
hospital
when
they
did
,
perhaps
I
would
not
be
here
to
commend
them
at
this
time
.
Many
thanks
for
a
job
well
done
.
The
Providence_Sunday_Journal
article
(
Jan.
29
)
asking
whether
American
taxpayers
are
being
victimized
by
a
gigantic
giveaway
to
pay
for
the
care
of
war
veterans
who
have
non-service-connected
disabilities
sounds
as
though
The
Providence_Journal
is
desperate
for
news
.
Usually
a
veteran
has
to
hang
himself
to
get
space
on
the
front
page
.
On
the
question
of
admission
to
Veterans_Administration
hospitals
of
service-connected
and
non-service-connected
disabled
veterans
,
it
must
be
recognized
that
there
are
many
men
who
are
greatly
affected
by
war
service
.
It
can
manifest
itself
before
discharge
from
service
,
or
it
can
come_out
years
later
.
There
is
one
other
point
we
should
never
lose
sight
of
:
Many
veterans
who
enter
VA
hospitals
as
non-service
cases
later
qualify
as
service-connected
.
No
psychiatrist
could
tell
me
that
the
experience
in
a
war
can
not
have
its
effect
in
the
ensuing
years
.
The
arguments
advanced
by
those
individuals
and
groups
who
oppose
the
system
in_force
and
who
would
drastically
curtail
or
do_away
entirely
with
hospital_care
for
the
non-service-connected
case
,
seem
to
be
coldly
impractical
and
out-of-step
with
the
wishes
of
the
general
public
.
I
believe_in
priority
for
service-connected
disabled
veterans
in
admission
to
VA
hospitals
.
But
I
do
n't
believe
we
should
close
the
door
on
nonservice-connected
patients
.
This
matter
is
of
great
importance
,
and
the
outcome
may
mean
the
difference
between
life
or
death
,
or
at_least
serious
injuries
,
for
many
veterans
.
Some
critics
say
that
the
length
of
stay
in
a
hospital
is
too
long
.
There
's
a
reason
for
this
length
of
stay
.
First_of_all
,
the
admitting
physician
in
the
VA
hospital
gets
the
patient
as
a
new
patient
.
He
has
no
experience
with
this
veteran
's
previous
medical_record
.
If
the
doctor
is
conscientious
,
he
wants
to
study
the
patient
.
As
a
result
,
it
takes
a_little
longer
than
it
would
on_the_outside
where
the
family
physician
knows
about
the
patient
.
Secondly
,
the
VA
physician
knows
that
when
the
patient
leaves
the
hospital
,
he
is
no_longer
going_to
have
a
chance
to
visit
his
patient
.
So
he
keeps
the
veteran
in
until
he
can
observe
the
effects
of
treatment
or
surgery
.
The
American
public
must
be
presented
with
the
facts
concerning
VA
hospitalization
.
The
public
should
understand
that
whether
they
support
a
state
hospital
or
a
VA
hospital
,
the
tax
dollar
has
to
be
paid
one
way
or
the
other
.
The
responsibility
is
still
going_to
be
there
whether
they
pay
for
a
VA
hospital
or
the
tax
dollar
is
spent
for
the
state
hospital
.
An
adequate
system
of
VA
hospitals
is
better
equipped
to
care
for
the
veterans
than
any
50
state
hospitals
.
It
seems
that
open
season
upon
veterans
'
hospitalization
is
once_more
upon
us
.
The
American_Medical_Association
is
once_again
grinding_out
its
tear-soaked
propaganda
based
upon
the
high
cost
of
the
Veterans_Administration
medical
program
to
the
American
taxpayer
.
Do
they
,
the
A._M._A.
,
offer
any
solution
other_than
outright
abolition
of
a
medical
system
unsurpassed
anywhere
in
the
world
?
We
veterans
acknowledge
the
fact
that
as
time
passes
the
demand
for
medical_care
at
VA
hospitals
will
grow
proportionately
as
age
fosters
illness
.
Nevertheless
,
we
wonder
at
the
stand
of
the
A._M._A.
on
the
health_problem
confronting
the
aged
.
They
opposed
the
Forand
bill
,
which
would
have
placed
the
major
burden
of
financial
support
upon
the
individual
himself
through
compulsory
payroll
deduction
;
yet
they
supported
the
Eisenhower
administration
which
will
cost
a
small
state
like
ours
approximately
five
million
dollars
(
matched
incidentally
by
a
federal
grant
)
to
initiate
.
