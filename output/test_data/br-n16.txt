Over
the
rattling
of
fenders
,
humming
of
tires
and
chattering
of
gears
there
was
a
charming
melody
of
whispers
and
tiny
giggles
.
Cool
air
moving
slowly
through
the
open
or
smashed
out
side
windows
hinted
of
blooming
roadside
vegetation
,
and
occasionally
a
faint
fragrance
of
perfume
swirled
from
the
back
seat
.
``
Moriarty
''
,
my
driver
suddenly
exclaimed
with
something
so
definite
,
so
final
in
his
tone
I
once_more
repeated
the
absurdity
,
mustering
all
my
latent
powers
of
hypocrisy
to
sound
convinced
.
We
were
coming
to
an
intersection
,
turning
right
,
chuffing
to
a
stop
.
Forced
to
realize
that
this
was
the
end
of
a
very
short
line
I
scanned
a
road
marker
and
discovered
what
the
end
of
a
slightly
longer
line
would
be
for
the
old
Mexican
:
Moriarty
,
New_Mexico
.
``
Gracias
.
Adios
''
,
I
said
,
exhausting
my
Spanish
vocabulary
on
my
host
and
exchanging
one
of
a
scarcely
tapped
store
of
smiles
with
my
host
's
daughters
.
I
waved
with
discretion
and
moderation
to
the
vague
golden
faces
fading
through
rising
dust
and
the
distortions
of
the
back
window
glass
.
Then
I
saw
the
father
's
head
slightly
turn
;
gauche
rainbow
shapes
replaced
the
poignant
ovals
of
gold
.
Autos
whizzed
past
.
White
shirted
and
conservatively
cravated
drivers
stared
conspicuously
toward
the
eastern
horizon
and
past
my
supplicating
and
accusing
gaze
.
Suddenly
a
treble
auto
horn
tootley-toot-tootled
,
and
,
thumbing
hopefully
,
I
saw
emergent
in
windshield
flash
:
red
lips
,
streaming
silk
of
blonde
hair
and
-
ah
,
trembling
confusion
of
hope
,
apprehension
,
despair
-
the
leering
face
of
old
Herry
.
``
Mor-ee-air-teeeee
''
,
he
shrieked
,
his
white
teeth
grossly
counterpointing
those
of
the
glittering
blonde
.
Over
the
rapidly
diminishing
outline
of
a
jump_seat
piled
high
with
luggage
Herry
's
black
brushcut
was
just
discernible
,
near
,
or
enviably
near
that
spot
where
-
hidden
-
more
delicately
textured
,
most
beautifully
tinted
hair
must
still
be
streaming
back
in
cool
,
oh
cool
wind
sweetly
perfumed
with
sagebrush
and
yucca
flowers
and
engine
fumes
.
Damn
his
luck
.
I
would
have
foregone
my
romantic
chances
rather
than
leave
a
friend
sweltering
and
dusty
and
-
Well
,
at_least
I
would
n't
have
shouted
back
a
taunt
.
Still
nursing
anger
I
listlessly
thumbed
a
car
that
was
slowly
approaching
,
its
pre-war
chrome
nearly
blinding
me
.
It
was
stopping
.
Just
as
I
straightened_up
with
my
duffel_bag
,
I
heard
:
``
Sahjunt_Yoorick
,
meet
Mrs._Major_J._A._Roebuck
''
.
The
voice
was
that
of
Johnson
,
tail
gunner
off
another
crew
.
Squeezing
a
look
between
Johnson
's
fat
jowls
and
the
car
frame
a
handsome
and
still
darkhaired
lady
inquired
``
Y_'_all_drahve
''
?
I
nodded
.
``
Onleh_one_thiihng
''
,
Mrs._Roebuck
continued
.
``
Ahm

But
Corporal_Johnson
has
alreadeh
said
it
didn_make_no
diffrunce_t

''
.
I
said
that
it
did
n't
make
any
difference
to
me
either
,
as
far
as
I
knew
.
How
far
I
knew
will
shortly
become
apparent
.
Let
me
pass_over
the
trip
to
Sante_Fe
with
something
of
the
same
speed
which
made
Mrs._Roebuck
``
wonduh
if
the
wahtahm
speed_limit
''
(
35
m._p._h
.
)
``
is
still
in
ee-faket
''
.
I
let_up
on
the
accelerator
,
only
to
gradually
reach
again
the
60
m._p._h.
which
would
,
I
hoped
,
overhaul
Herry
and
the
blonde
,
and
as
there
were
cars
whose
drivers
apparently
had
something
more
important
to
catch
than
had
I
,
Mrs._Major_Roebuck
settled_down
to
practicing
on
Corporal_Johnson
the
kittenish
wiles
she
would
need
when
making
her
duty
call
on
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Somebody
in
Sante_Fe
.
When
Johnson
ejaculated
``
Howsabout
my
buying
us
all
a
nice
cold
Co-cola
,
Ma_'_am
''
?
Mrs._Roebuck
smilingly
declined
and
began
suddenly
to
go_on
about
her
son
,
who
was
``
onleh
a_little
younguh
than
you
bawhs
''
.
Johnson
never
would
have
believed
she
had
a
son
that
age
.
Mrs._Roebuck
thought
Johnson
was
a
``
sweet
bawh
t
'
lah
lahk
thet
''
,
but
her
Herman
was
getting_to
be
a
man
,
there
was
no
getting_around
it
.
``

``

,
Johnson
said
.
``
I
'm
a
good
Baptist
,
and
drinking
&
&
&
''
.
Mrs._Roebuck
very
kindly
let
me
drive
through
Sante_Fe
to
a
road
which
would
,
she
said
,
lead
us
to
Taos
and_then
Raton
and
``
eventshahleh
''
out
of
New_Mexico
.
How
lightly
her
``
eventshah-leh
''
passed_into_the_crannies
where
I
was
storing
dialect
material
for
some
vaguely
dreamed
opus
,
and
how
the
word
would
echo
.
And
re-echo
.
Hardly
had
Mrs._Roebuck
driven
off
when
a
rusty
pick-up
truck
,
father
or
grandfather
of
Senor
``
Moriarty
's
''
Ford
sedan
,
came
screeching
to
a
dust
swirling
stop
,
and
a
brown
face
appeared
,
its
nose
threatened
by
shards
of_what
had
once
been
the
side
window
.
``
Get_in
,
buddies
.
Get_in
''
.
The
straight
,
black
hair
flopped
in
a
vigorous
nod
,
the
slender
nose
plunged
toward
glass
teeth
and
drew
safely
back
.
Johnson
unwired
the
right_hand
door
,
whose
window
was
,
like
the
left
one
,
merely
loosely
taped
fragments
of
glass
,
and
Johnson
wadded
himself
into
a
narrow
seat
made
still
more
narrow
by
three
cases
of
beer
.
``
In
back
,
buddy
''
,
the
driver
said
to
me
.
Quickly
but
carefully
lowering
my
duffel_bag
over
the
low
side
rack
,
I
stepped_on
the
running_board
;
it
flopped
down
,
sprang
back
up
and
gouged
my
shin
.
The
truck
was
hurtling
forward
.
I
seized
the
rack
and
made
a
western
style
flying
mount
just_in_time
,
one
of
my
knees
mercifully
landing
on
my
duffel_bag
-
and
merely
wrecking
my
camera
,
I
was
to
discover
later
-
my
other
knee
landing
on
the
slivery
truck
floor_boards
and
-
but
this
is
no
medical_report
.
I
was
again
in
motion
and
at
a
speed
which
belied
the
truck
's
similarity
to
Senor_X
's
Ford
turtle
.
Maybe
I
would
beat
old
Herry
to
Siberia
after_all
.
Whatever
satisfaction
that
might
offer
.
Something
pulled
my
leg
.
I
drew_back
,
drawing_back
my
foot
for
a
kick
.
But
it
was
only
Johnson
reaching
around
the
wire
chicken
fencing
,
which
half
covered
the
truck
cab
's
glassless
rear_window
.
The
way
his
red
rubber
lips
were
stretched
across
his
pearly
little
teeth
I
though
he
was
only
having
a
little
joke
,
but
,
no
,
he
wanted
me
to
bend
down
from
the
roar
of
wind
so
he
could
roar
something
into
my
ear
.
``
Wanna
beer
''
?
``
Hell
,
yes
''
,
I
roared
back
between
dusty
lips
.
Did
I
want
a
beer
?
Did
an
anteater
want
ants
?
``
Bueno
,
amigo
.
Gracias
''
,
I
hollered
,
my
first
long
swallow
filling
me
with
confidence
and
immediately
doubling
the
size
of
my
Spanish
vocabulary
.
At_once
my
ears
were
drowned
by
a
flow
of
what
I
took_to_be
Spanish
,
but
-
the
driver
's
white
teeth
flashing
at
me
,
the
road
wildly
veering
beyond
his
glistening
hair
,
beyond
his
gesticulating
bottle
-
it
could
have
been
the
purest
Oxford_English
I
was
half
hearing
;
I
would
n't
have
known
the
difference
.
Johnson
was
trying
to
grab
the
wheel
,
though
the
swerve
of
the
truck
was
throwing
him
away
from_it
.
White
teeth
suddenly
vanishing
,
the
driver
slammed
the
side
of
his
bottle
against
Johnson
's
ear
.
We
were
off
the
road
,
gleaming
barbed_wire
pulling
taut
.
I
ducked
just
as
the
first
strand
broke
somewhere
down
the
line
and
came
whipping
over
the
sideboards
.
We
were
in
a
field
,
in
a
tight
,
screeching
turn
.
Prairie_dogs
were
popping_up
and
popping
down
.
When
I
fell
on
my
back
,
I
saw
a
vulture
hovering
.
Just
as
I
got
to
my
knees
,
there
was
again
the
sound
of
the
fence
stretching
,
and
I
had
time
only
to
start
taking
my
kneeling
posture
seriously
.
This
time
no
wire
came
whipping
into
the
truck
.
We
were
back
on
the
road
.
I
regained
my
squatting
position
behind
the
truck
cab
's
rear_window
.
Johnson
's
left_hand
was
pressed
against
the
side
of
his
head
,
red
cheeks
whitening
beneath
his
fingers
.
``
Tee-wah
''
,
the
driver
cackled
,
his
black
eyes
glittering
behind
dull
silver
chicken
fencing
.
``
That
was
Tee-wah
I
was
talking
.
You
thought
I
was
a
Mexican
,
did
n't
you
,
buddy
''
?
I
nodded
.
``
Hell
,
that
's
all_right
,
buddy
''
,
the
Indian
(
I
now
guessed
)
said
.
``
Drink
your
beer
''
.
Miraculously
,
the
bottle
was
still
in
my
hand
,
foam
still
geysering
over
my
(
luckily
)
waterproof
watch
.
No
sooner
had
I
started
drinking
than
the
driver
started
zigzagging
the
truck
.
The
beer
foamed
furiously
.
I
drank
furiously
.
A
long
time
.
Emptied
the
bottle
.
Teeth
again
flashing
back
at
me
,
the
driver
released
a
deluge
of
Spanish
in
which
``
amigo
''
appeared
every_so_often
like
an
island
in
the
stormy
waves
of
surrounding
sound
.
I
bobbed
my
head
each
time
it
appeared
.
Suddenly
the
Spanish
became
an
English
in
which
only
one
word
emerged
with
clarity
and
precision
,
``
son_of_a_bitch
''
,
sometimes
hyphenated
by
vicious
jabs
of
a
beer_bottle
into
Johnson
's
quivering
ribs
.
A
big
car
was
approaching
,
its
chrome
teeth
grinning
.
Beyond
it
the
gray
road
stretched
a
long
,
long
way
.
The
car
was
just
about
to
us
,
its
driver
's
fat
,
solemn
face
intent
on
the
road
ahead
,
on
business
,
on
a
family
in
Sante_Fe
-
on
anything
but
an
old
pick-up
truck
in
which
two
human_beings
desperately
needed
rescue
.
I
tossed
the
bottle
.
High
,
so
it
would
only
bounce
harmlessly
but
loudly
off
the
car
's
steel
roof
.
Too
high
.
On
unoccupied
roadway
the
bottle
shattered
into
a
small
amber
flash
.
``
Aye-yah-ah-ah
''
!
The
Indian
was
again
raising
his
bottle
,
but
to
my
astonished
relief
-
probably
only
a
fraction
of
Johnson
's
-
the
bottle
this
time
went
to
the
Indian
's
lips
.
Another
car
was
coming
,
a
tiny
,
dark
shape
on
a
far
hill
.
I
started
looking
on
the
splintery
truck_bed
for
a
piece
of
board
,
a
dirt
clod
-
anything
I
could
throw
and
with
better
aim
than
I
had
thrown
the
beer_bottle
.
We
were
slowing
.
In
the
ditch
sand
was
white
and
soft
looking
,
only
an
occasional
pebble
discernible
,
faintly
gleaming
.
But
Johnson
could
n't
quickly
unwire
the
truck
door
,
and
if
I
escaped
,
he
might
suffer
.
The
car
was
approaching
fast
.
On
the
truck_bed
there
was
nothing
smaller
than
a
piece
of
rusty
machinery
;
with
more
time
I
could
have
loosened
a
small
burr
or
cotter_pin
-
Suddenly
and
not
a
second
too
soon
I
thought_of
the
coins
in
my
pocket
.
There
was
no
time
to
pick_out
a
penny
;
I
got
a
coin
between
my
thumb
and
forefinger
,
leaned
my
elbows
in
a
very
natural
and
casual
manner
on
top
of
the
truck
cab
and
flipped
my
little
missile
.
There
was
a
blur
just
under
my
focus
of
vision
,
a
crash
;
the
car
's
far
windshield
panel
turned_into
a
silver
web
with
a
dark
hole
in_the
center
.
I
heard
the
screech
of
brakes
behind
me
,
an
insane
burst
of
laughter
beneath
me
.
Looking_back
I
saw
a
gray-haired
man
getting_out
of
his
halted
car
and
trying
to
read
our
license_number
.
``
S-s-sahjunt
''
.
Johnson
's
fat
hand
,
another
bottle
were
protruding
from
the
truck
cab
,
and
that
self
proclaimed
Baptist
teetotaler
,
had
a
bottle
at
his
own
lips
.
Two
cars
came
over
a
crest
,
their
chrome
and
glass
flashing
.
The
Indian
's
arm
whipped
sidewise
-
there
was
a
flash
of
amber
and
froth
,
the
crash
of
the
bottle
shattering
against
the
side
of
the
first
car
.
Brakes
shrieked
behind
us
.
I
saw
Johnson
's
bottle
snatched
from
his
hand
,
saw
it
go
in
a
swirl
of
foam
just
behind
the
second
car
.
This
time
there
was
no
sound
of
brakes
but
the
shrieking
of
women
.
I
looked_back
at
pale
ovals
framed
in
the
elongated
oval
of
the
car
's
rear_window
.
``
Drink
,
you
son_of_a_bitch
''
!
I
quickly
turned_around
and
began
to
drink
.
But
the
Indian
was
jabbing
another
bottle
toward
Johnson
.
