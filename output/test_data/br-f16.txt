On
April
17
,
1610
,
the
sturdy
little
three
masted
bark
,
Discovery
,
weighed_anchor
in
St._Katherine's_Pool
,
London
,
and
floated
down
the
Thames
toward_the_sea
.
She
carried
,
besides
her
captain
,
a
crew
of
twenty-one
and
provisions
for
a
voyage
of
exploration
of
the
Arctic
waters
of
North_America
.
Seventeen
months
later
,
on
September
6
,
1611
,
an
Irish
fishing_boat
sighted
the
Discovery
limping
eastward
outside
Galway_Bay
.
When
she
reached
port
,
she
was
found
to
have
on_board
only
eight
men
,
all
near
starvation
.
The
captain
was
gone
,
and
the
mate
was
gone
.
The
man
who
now
commanded
her
had
started
the
voyage
as
an
ordinary
seaman
.
What
disaster
struck
the
Discovery
during
those
seventeen
months
?
What
happened
to
the
fourteen
missing
men
?
These
questions
have
remained
one
of
the
great
sea
mysteries
of_all_time
.
For
hundreds
of
years
,
the
evidence
available
consisted_of
(
1
)
the
captain
's
fragmentary
journal
,
(
2
)
a
highly
prejudiced
account
by
one
of
the
survivors
,
(
3
)
a
note
found
in
a
dead
man
's
desk
on_board
,
and
(
4
)
several
second-hand
reports
.
All_told
,
they
offered
a
highly
confused
picture
.
But
since
1927
,
researchers
digging_into
ancient
court
records
and
legal
files
have
been
able
to
find
illuminating
pieces
of
information
.
Not
enough
to
do
away
with
all
doubts
,
but
sufficient
to
give
a
fairly
accurate
picture
of
the
events
of
the
voyage
.
Historians
have
had
two
reasons
for
persisting
so
long
in
their
investigations
.
First
,
they
wanted
to
clarify
a
tantalizing
,
bizarre
enigma
.
Second
,
they
believed
it
important
to
determine
the
fate
of
the
captain
-
a
man
whose
name
is
permanently
stamped
on
our
maps
,
on
American
towns
and
counties
,
on
a
great
American
river
,
and
on
half
a_million
square_miles
of
Arctic
seas
.
The
name
:
Henry_Hudson
.
This
is
the
story
of
his
last
tragic
voyage
,
as_nearly_as
we
are
able
-
or
ever
,
probably
,
will
be
able
-
to
determine
:
The
sailing
in
the
spring
of
1610
was
Hudson
's
fourth
in
four
years
.
Each
time
his
objective
had
been
the
same
-
a
direct
water
passage
from
Western
Europe
to
the
Far_East
.
In
1607
and
1608
,
the
English
Muscovy_Company
had
sent
him
northward
to
look_for
a
route
over
the
North_Pole
or
across
the
top
of
Russia
.
Twice
he
had
failed
,
and
the
Muscovy_Company
indicated
it
would
not
back
him
again
.
In
1609
,
the
Dutch_East_India_Company
hired
Hudson
,
gave
him
two
learned
geographers
,
fitted
him
out
with
a
ship
called
the
Half_Moon
,
and
supplied
him
with
Dutch
sailors
.
This
time
he
turned
westward
,
to
the
middle_Atlantic
coast
of
North_America
.
His
chief
discovery
was
important
-
the
Great_North
(
later
,
the
Hudson
)
River
-
but
it
produced
no
northwest
passage
.
When
the
Half_Moon
put
in
at
Dartmouth
,
England
,
in
the
fall
of
1609
,
word
of
Hudson
's
findings
leaked_out
,
and
English
interest
in
him
revived
.
The
government
forbade
Hudson
to
return
to
Amsterdam
with
his
ship
.
He
thereupon
went
to
London
and
spent
the
winter
talking
to
men
of
wealth
.
By
springtime
,
he
was
supported
by
a
rich
merchant
syndicate
under
the
patronage
of
Henry
,
Prince_of_Wales
.
He
had
obtained
and
provisioned
a
veteran
ship
called
the
Discovery
and
had
recruited
a
crew
of
twenty-one
,
the
largest
he
had
ever
commanded
.
The
purpose
of
this
fourth
voyage
was
clear
.
A
century
of
exploration
had
established
that
a
great
land_mass
,
North
and
South
America
,
lay
between
Europe
and
the_Indies
.
One_by_one
,
the
openings
in
the
coast
that
promised
a
passage
through
had
been
explored
and
discarded
.
In_fact
,
Hudson
's
sail
up
the
Great_North_River
had
disposed
of
one
of
the
last
hopes
.
But
there
remained
one
mysterious
,
unexplored
gap
,
far
to_the_north
.
Nearly
twenty-five
years
before
,
Captain_John_Davis
had
noted
,
as
he
sailed
near
the
Arctic_Circle
,
``
a
very
great
gulf
,
the
water
whirling
and
roaring
,
as_it_were
the
meeting
of
tides
''
.
He
named
this
opening
,
between
Baffin_Island
and
Labrador
,
the
``
Furious_Overfall
''
.
(
Later
,
it
was
to
be
called
Hudson_Strait
.
)
In
1602
,
George_Waymouth
,
in
the
same
little
Discovery
that
Hudson
now
commanded
,
had
sailed
300
miles
up
the
strait
before
his
frightened
men
turned
the
ship
back
.
Hudson
now
proposed
to
sail
all_the_way
through
and
test
the
seas
beyond
for
the
long
sought
waterway
.
Even
Hudson
,
experienced
in
Arctic
sailing
and
determined
as
he
was
,
must
have
had
qualms
as
he
slid
down
the
Thames
.
Ahead
were
perilous
,
ice
filled
waters
.
On
previous
voyages
,
it
had
been
in
precisely
such
dangerous
situations
that
he
had
failed
as
a
leader
and
captain
.
On
the
second
voyage
,
he
had
turned_back
at
the
frozen
island
of
Novaya_Zemlya
and
meekly
given
the
crew
a
certificate
stating
that
he
did
so
of
his
own
free_will
-
which
was
obviously
not
the
case
.
On
the
third
voyage
,
a
near
mutiny
rising
from
a
quarrel
between
Dutch
and
English
crew_members
on
the
Half_Moon
had
almost
forced
him
to
head
the
ship
back
to
Amsterdam
in
mid
Atlantic
.
Worse
,
his
present
crew
included
five
men
who
had
sailed
with
him
before
.
Of
only
one
could
he
be
sure
-
young
John_Hudson
,
his
second
son
.
The
mate
,
Robert_Juet
,
who
had
kept
the
journal
on
the
half_Moon
,
was
experienced
-
but
he
was
a
bitter
old_man
,
ready
to
complain
or
desert
at
any
opportunity
.
Philip_Staffe
,
the
ship
's
carpenter
,
was
a
good
worker
,
but
perversely
independent
.
Arnold_Lodley
and
Michael_Perse
were
like
the
rest
-
lukewarm
,
ready
to
swing
against
Hudson
in
a
crisis
.
But
men
willing
to
sail
at_all
into
waters
where
wooden
ships
could
be
crushed
like
eggs
were
hard
to
find
.
Hudson
knew
he
had
to
use
these
men
as_long_as
he
remained
an
explorer
.
And
he
refused
to
be
anything
else
.
It
is
believed
that
Hudson
was
related
to
other
seafaring
men
of
the
Muscovy_Company
and
was
trained
on
company
ships
.
He
was
a
Londoner
,
married
,
with
three
sons
.
(
The
common
misconception
that
he
was
Dutch
and
that
his
first_name
was
Hendrik
stem
from
Dutch
documents
of
his
third
voyage
.
)
In
1610
,
Hudson
was
probably
in
his
early
forties
,
a
good
navigator
,
a
stubborn
voyager
,
but
otherwise
fatally
unsuited
to
his
chosen
profession
.
Hudson
's
first
error
of
the
fourth
voyage
occurred
only
a_few
miles
down
the
Thames
.
There
at
the
river
's
edge
waited
one
Henry_Greene
,
whom
Hudson
listed
as
a
``
clerk
''
.
Greene
was
in
actuality
a
young
ruffian
from
Kent
,
who
had
broken_with
his
parents
in_order
to
keep
the
company
he
preferred
-
pimps
,
panders
and
whores
.
He
was
not
the
sort
of
sailor
Hudson
wanted
his
backers
to
see
on_board
and
he
had
Greene
wait
at
Gravesend
,
where
the
Discovery
picked
him
up
.
For
the
first
three
weeks
,
the
ship
skirted
up
the
east
coast
of
Great_Britain
,
then
turned
westward
.
On
May
11
,
she
reached
Iceland
.
Poor
winds
and
fog
locked
her
up
in
a
harbor
the
crew
called
``
Lousie_Bay
''
.
The
subsequent
two-weeks
wait
made
the
crew
quarrelsome
.
With
Hudson
looking_on
,
his
protege
Greene
picked
a
fight
with
the
ship
's
surgeon
,
Edward_Wilson
.
The
issue
was
settled
on_shore
,
Greene
winning
and
Wilson
remaining
ashore
,
determined
to
catch
the
next
fishing_boat
back
to
England
.
With
difficulty
,
Hudson
persuaded
him
to
rejoin
the
ship
,
and
they
sailed
from
Iceland
.
Early
in
June
,
the
Discovery
passed
``
Desolation
''
(
southern
Greenland
)
and
in
mid-June
entered
the
``
Furious_Overfall
''
.
Floating
ice
bore_down
from
the
north
and
west
.
Fog
hung
over
the
route
constantly
.
Turbulent
tides
rose
as_much_as
fifty
feet
.
The
ship
's
compass
was
useless
because
of
the
nearness
of
the
magnetic
North_Pole
.
As
the
bergs
grew
larger
,
Hudson
was
forced
to
turn
south
into
what
is
now
Ungava_Bay
,
an
inlet
of
the
great
strait
.
After
finding
that
its
coasts
led
nowhere
,
however
,
he
turned
north
again
,
toward
the
main
,
ice
filled
passageway
-
and
the
crew
,
at_first
uneasy
,
then
frightened
,
rebelled
.
The
trouble
was
at_least
partly
Juet
's
doing
.
For
weeks
he
had
been
saying
that
Hudson
's
idea
of
sailing
through
to
Java
was
absurd
.
The
great
,
crushing
ice
masses
coming
into
view
made
him
sound
like
the
voice
of
pure
reason
.
A
group
of
sailors
announced
to
Hudson
that
they
would
sail
no
farther
.
Instead
of
quelling
the
dissension
,
as
many
captains
of
the
era
would
have
done
(
Sir_Francis_Drake
lopped
a
man
's
head
off
under
similar
circumstances
)
,
Hudson
decided
to
be
reasonable
.
He
went_to
his
cabin
and
emerged
carrying
a
large
chart
,
which
he
set_up
in_view
of
the
crew
.
Patiently
,
he
explained
what
he
knew
about
their
course
and
their
objectives
.
When
Hudson
had
finished
,
the
``
town_meeting
''
broke_down
into
a
general
,
wordy
argument
.
One
man
remarked
that
if
he
had
a_hundred
pounds
,
he
would
give
ninety
of
them
to
be
back
in
England
.
Up
spoke
carpenter
Staffe
,
who
said
he
would
n't
give
ten
pounds
to
be
home
.
The
statement
was
effective
.
The
meeting
broke_up
.
Hudson
was
free
to
sail
on
.
All
through
July
the
Discovery
picked
her
way
along
the
450
-
mile
long
strait
,
avoiding
ice
and
rocky
islands
.
On
August
3
,
two
massive
headlands
reared
out
of
the
mists
-
great
gateways
never
before
,
so_far
as
Hudson
knew
,
seen
by
Europeans
.
To
starboard
was
a
cape
a_thousand
feet
high
,
patched
with
ice
and
snow
,
populated
by
thousands
of
screaming
sea_birds
.
To
port
was
a
point
200
feet
high
rising
behind
to
a
precipice
of
2000
feet
.
Hudson
named
the
capes
Digges
and
Wolstenholme
,
for
two
of
his
backers
.
Hudson
pointed
the
Discovery
down
the
east
coast
of
the
newly
discovered
sea
(
now
called
Hudson_Bay
)
,
confident
he
was
on_his_way
to
the
warm
waters
of
the
Pacific
.
After
three
weeks
'
swift
sailing
,
however
,
the
ship
entered
an
area
of
shallow
marshes
and
river
deltas
.
The
ship
halted
.
The
great
``
sea
to
the
westwards
''
was
a
dead_end
.
This
must
have
been
Hudson
's
blackest
discovery
.
For
he
seemed
to
sense
at_once
that
before
him
was
no
South_Sea
,
but
the
solid
bulk
of
the
North_American
continent
.
This
was
the
bitter_end
,
and
Hudson
seemed
to
know
he
was
destined
to
failure
.
Feverishly
,
he
tried
to
brush
away
this
intuition
.
North
and
south
,
east
and
west
,
back_and_forth
he
sailed
in
the
land-locked
bay
,
plowing
furiously
forward
until
land
appeared
,
then
turning
to
repeat
the
process
,
day_after_day
,
week_after_week
.
Hundreds
of
miles
to_the_north
,
the
route
back
to
England
through
the
``
Furious_Overfall
''
was
again
filling
with
ice
.
The
men
were
at_first
puzzled
,
then
angered
by
the
aimless
tacking
.
Once_more
,
Juet
's
complaints
were
the
loudest
.
Hudson
's
reply
was
to
accuse
the
mate
of
disloyalty
.
Juet
demanded
that
Hudson
prove
his
charges
in
an
open
trial
.
The
trial
was
held
September
10
.
Hudson
,
presiding
,
heard
Juet
's
defense
,
then
called_for
testimony
from
crew_members
.
Juet
had
made
plentiful
enemies
,
several
men
stepped_forward
.
Hands
on
Bible
,
seaman
Lodley
and
carpenter
Staffe
swore
that
Juet
had
tried
to
persuade
them
to
keep
muskets
and
swords
in
their
cabins
.
Cook_Bennett_Mathues
said
Juet
had
predicted
bloodshed
on
the
ship
.
Others
added
that
Juet
had
wanted
to
turn
the
ship
homeward
.
Hudson
deposed
Juet
and
cut
his
pay
.
The
new
mate
was
Robert_Bylot
,
talented
but
inexperienced
.
There
were
other
shifts
and
pay_cuts
according
to
the
way
individuals
had
conducted
themselves
.
The
important
result
,
however
,
was
that
Juet
and
Francis_Clemens
,
the
deposed
boatswain
,
became
Hudson
's
sworn
enemies
.
As
Hudson
resumed
his
desperate
criss-crossing
of
the
little
bay
,
every
incident
lessened
the
crew
's
respect
for
him
.
Once
,
after
the
Discovery
lay
for
a
week
in
rough
weather
,
Hudson
ordered
the
anchor
raised
before
the
sea
had
calmed
.
Just
as
it
was
being
hauled
inboard
,
a
sea
hit
the
ship
.
Michael_Butt
and
Adame_Moore
were
thrown
off
the
capstan
and
badly
injured
.
The
anchor
cable
would
have
been
lost
overboard
,
but
Philip_Staffe
was
on_hand
to
sever
it
with
his
axe
.
