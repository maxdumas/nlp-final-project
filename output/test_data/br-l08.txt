``
Well
''
-
said
Mr._Skyros
.
``
I
take
a
little
time
to
think
it
over
''
.
It
was
awkward
:
very
awkward
.
There
would
be
all
the
nuisance
of
contacting
someone
else
to
take_over
.
Someone
reasonably
trustworthy
.
And
Angie
would
hear
about
it
.
And
Angie
knew
-
``
Time
''
,
said
Angie
,
and
he
smiled
very
sweet
and
slow
at
Mr._Skyros
.
``
Not
too
much
time
,
because
I
'll
be
needing
some
more
myself
pretty_much
right_away
.
And
I
done
favors
for
you
,
big
favor
not
so
long
back
,
did
n't
I
,
and
I
'm
right
here
to
take_on
where
Pretty
left_off
.
No
trouble
.
I
do
n't
want
no
trouble
,
you
do
n't
want
no
trouble
,
nobody
wants
trouble
,
Mr._Skyros
''
.
Dear_heaven
,
no
,
thought
Mr._Skyros
,
turning_away
as
another
man
came_in
.
He
straightened
his
tie
at
the
mirror
with
a
shaking
hand
;
the
genial
smile
seemed
painted
on
his
face
.
Angie
knew
-
Speak_of
dangerous
information
!
Angie
knew
too_much
entirely
already
.
Really
he
had
Mr._Skyros
at_bay
.
``
Big
favor
I
done
you
.
Acourse
there
's
this
deal
o
'
Denny
's
-
and
Jackie
's
-
kinda
hangin_'_fire
,
ai
n't
it
,
maybe
you
've
been
kinda
worryin
'
over
that
.
And
can
n't
say
I
blame
you
''
,
said
Angie
thoughtfully
.
``
This
deal
with
the
ace
o
'
spades
.
Anything
to
do
with
an
ace
o
'
spades
,
bad_luck
''
.
Ace_of_spades
-
a
widow
,
that
was
what
they
called
a
widow
,
these
low-class
crooks
remembered
Mr._Skyros
distractedly
.
All
about
that
Angie
knew
,
too
.
When
things
got
a_little
out_of_hand
,
they
very
rapidly
got
a_lot
out_of_hand
-
it
seemed
to
be
a
general
rule
.
All
just
by_chance
,
and
in_a_way
tracing
back
to
poor
Frank
,
all_of
it
,
because
naturally
-
brothers
,
living
together
-
and
Angie
-
Mr._Skyros
did
not
at
all
like
the
look
on
Angelo
's
regular
featured
,
almost
girlishly
good-looking
face
-
or
indeed
anything
about
Angelo
.
Mr._Skyros
was
not
a
man
who
thought
very_much
about
moral_principles
;
he
found
money
much
more
interesting
;
but
all_the_same
he
thought
now
,
uneasily
,
of
the
way
in
which
Angelo
earned
his
living
-
and
paid
for
his
own
stuff
-
and
eyed
the
soft
smile
,
and
the
spaniel
like
dark
eyes
,
and
he
felt
a_little
ill
.
``
Look
,
my
friend
''
,
he
said
,
``
in
my
life
I
learn
,
how
is
it
the
proverb
says
,
better
an
ounce
of
prevention
to
a
pound
of
cure
.
I
stay
in
business
so
long
because
I
'm
careful
.
Two_weeks
,
a
month
,
we
talk
it
over
again
,
and
maybe
if
nothing
happens
meanwhile
to
say
the
cops
know
this_and_that
,
then
we
make
a
little
deal
,
is
n't
it
''
?
``
That
's
a
long
while
''
,
said
Angie
.
``
I
tell
you
,
you
want
to
leave
it
that
way
,
I
do
n't
fool_around
with
it
.
I
go
over
to
Castro
and
get
fixed_up
there
.
I
can
n't
wait
no
two_weeks
''
.
And
Mr._Skyros
did
n't
like
Angie
,
but
what
with
Prettyman
and
three
of
his
boys
inside
,
and
not
likely
to
come_out
-
And
Angie
such
a
valuable
salesman
,
Prettyman
said
-
All
the
nuisance
and
danger
of
getting_in_touch
with
practically
a
whole
new
bunch
of
boys
-
Why
did
everything
have
to
happen
at_once
?
Denny
said
stupidly
,
``
Why
,
you
ai
n't
turning
Angie
down
,
are
you
,
Mr._Skyros
?
I
mean
,
we
all
figured
-
I
guess
anybody
'd
figure
-
Angie
''
-
Angelo
gave
him
an
affectionate
smile
.
``
Mr._Skyros
too
smart
a
fellow
want
to
get_rid_of
me
''
,
he
said
.
``
It
's
O._K.
,
Denny
,
everything
's
O._K.
Ai
n't
it
,
Mr._Skyros
''
?
Oh
,
God
,
the
name
repeated
over_and_over
,
anybody
to
hear
-
Not
being
a
fool
,
Mr._Skyros
knew
why
.
But
aside
from
everything
else
,
it
would
scarcely
be
pleasant
to
have
dealings
with
one
who
was
nominally
an
underling
and
actually
held
-
you
could
say
-
the
whip_hand
.
And
all
because
of
Domokous
!
If
Mr._Skyros
had
dreamed
of
all
the
trouble
that
young_man
would
eventually
cause
-
Of_course
,
there
was
another
factor
.
Angie
worth
his
weight
in
gold
right
now
,
but
these
users
,
they
sometimes
went_down
fast
.
Who
knew
,
Angie
might
not
last
long
.
The
sweat
broke_out
on
Mr._Skyros
'
forehead
as
he
realized
he
had
been
actually
thinking
-
hoping
-
planning
-
perhaps
-
Good_God_above
,
had
not
Domokous
been
enough
?
He
patted
Angelo
's
thin
shoulder
paternally
.
``
Now
you
do
n't
want
to
go
talking
that
way
''
,
he
said
.
``
Sure
,
sure
,
you
're
the
one
take_over
for
Pretty
,
soon
as
I
get
the
supply
,
get
started
up
again
,
is
n't
it
?
You
do
n't
need
worry
,
Angelo
.
I
tell
you
,
I
know
how
it
is
with
you
,
my
friend
,
I
sympathize
,
and
I
'll
make
it
a
special
point
-
a
special
favor
-
get_in_touch
,
and
get
some
stuff
just
for
you
.
I
do
n't
know
if
I
can
manage
it
tonight
or
tomorrow
,
but
I
'll
try
my
best
,
my
friend
.
You
see
,
you
got
to
remember
,
we
all
got
schedules
,
like
any
business
!
My
man
,
he
won
n't
be
around
a
little
while
,
he
just
fixed
me
up
with
this
stuff
they
took_out
of
the
Elite
.
It
's
awkward
,
you
see
that
,
is
n't
it
''
?
``
Well
,
that
's
your
business
,
Mr._Skyros
''
,
said
Angie
,
and
his
dreamy
eyes
moved
past
Mr._Skyros
'
shoulder
to
gaze
vaguely
out
the
ground_glass
window
.
``
I
appreciate
it
,
you
do
that
.
Sure
.
We
do
n't
none
of
us
want
no
trouble
.
I
'm
in
a
room
over
the
Golden_Club
on
San_Pedro
,
you
just
ask
for
me
there
,
you
want
see
me
.
Or
maybe
I
call
you
-
tonight
?
About
nine
o
'
clock
,
I
call
and
see
if
you
got
any
.
A
couple
decks
for
me
,
Mr._Skyros
-
and
ten
twelve
to
sell
,
see
,
I
like
to
have
a
little
ready
cash
''
.
``
Oh
,
now
,
I
do
n't
know
about
that
much
''
,
said
Mr._Skyros
.
``
And
you
know
,
Angelo
,
Pretty
,
he
always
keeps
it
a
strict
cash_basis
,
like
they
say
''
-
``
Sure
''
,
said
Angie
.
``
Sure
,
Mr._Skyros
.
Fifty
a
throw
,
that
the
deal
?
Sure
.
I
bring
you
the
cash
,
say
five_hundred
for
ten
decks
.
Never
mind
how
much
I
cut
it
,
how
much
I
get
''
,
and
he
smiled
his
sleepy
smile
again
.
``
Standard
deal
,
Mr._Skyros
.
You
go
'
n
'
have_a_look
round
for
it
''
.
``
I
do
my
best
''
,
said
Mr._Skyros
earnestly
,
``
just
for
you
,
my
friend
.
This
is
awkward
for
everybody
,
is
n't
it
,
we
all
got
to
put_up
with
inconvenience
sometimes
.
But
I
do
my
best
for
you
''
.
He
got_out
of
there
in
a
hurry
,
brushing
past
another
man
in
the
door
,
mopping
his
brow
.
The
expedient
thing
-
yes
,
very
true
,
one
must
make_do
as
one
could
,
in
some
situations
.
It
could
all
be
straightened_out
later
.
Not
very_much
later
,
but
when
things
had
settled_down
a_little
.
After
this
deal
with
the
Bouvardier
woman
went_through
.
An
ace_of_spades
.
He
was
not
a
superstitious
man
,
but
he
felt
perhaps
there
was
a
little
something
in_that
,
indeed
.
He
rather
wished
he
had
never
got_into
the
business
,
and
still
-
scarcely
to
be
resisted
,
a
nice
little
profit
with
not
much
work
involved
,
easy_money
.
Katya_Roslev
,
who
would
be
Katharine_Ross
so
very
soon
now
,
rang_up
her
first
sale
of
the
day
and
counted
back
the
change
.
She
did
not
notice
that
the
customer
seized
her
purchase
and
turned_away
without
a
smile
or
a
word
of
thanks
.
Usually
she
marked
the
few
who
did
thank_you
,
you
did
n't
get
that
kind
much
in
a
place
like
this
:
and
she
played
a
little
game
with
herself
,
seeing
how
downright
rude
she
could
act
to
the
others
,
before
they
'd
take
offense
,
threaten
to
call
the
manager
.
Funny
how
seldom
they
did
:
used_to
it
,
probably
.
The
kind
who
came
into
a
cheap
store
like
this
!
Grab
,
snatch
,
I
saw
that
first
!
and
,
Here
,
I
'll
take
this
,
I
was
before
her
,
you
wait_on
me
now
or
I
do
n't
bother
with
it
,
see
!
This
kind
of
place
.
She
'd
be
through
here
,
just
no
time
at_all
-
leave
this
kind
of
thing
'
way
behind
.
Off
at
noon
,
and
she
'd
never
come_back
.
Never
have
to
.
Money
-
a_lot
of
money
,
enough
.
She
'd
be
smart
about
it
,
get
him
to
give
it
to
her
in
little
bills
so
's
nobody
would
suspect
-
maybe
could
n't
get
it
until
Monday
account_of
that
,
the
banks
-
But
that
was
n't
really
long
to
wait
.
Not
when
she
'd
waited
so
long
already
.
No
need
say
anything
at_all
to
the
old_woman
.
She
had
it
all
planned
out
,
how
she
'd
do
.
She
'd
say
she
did
n't
feel
good
on
Sunday
,
could
n't
go_to
church
-
there
'd
be
a
little
argument
,
but
she
could
be
stubborn
-
and
when
the
old_woman
had
gone
,
quick
pack
the
things
she
'd
need
to
take
,
all
but
the
dress
she
'd
wear
Monday
,
and
take
the
bag
down
to
that
place
in
the
station
where
you
could
put
things
in
a
locker
overnight
,
for
a
dime
.
Then
on
Monday
morning
-
or
it
might
have
to
be
Tuesday
-
get_up
and
leave
just
the
usual
time
,
and
last
thing
,
put
the
money
in
an
envelope
under
the
old_woman
's
purse
there
in
the
drawer
.
She
would
n't
be
going_to
get
that
for
an
hour
or_so
after
Katya
had
left
,
go
do
the
daily
shopping
.
No
need
leave
a
note
with
it
,
either
-
or
maybe
just
something
like
,
Do
n't
worry
about
me
,
I
'm
going_away
to
make
a
better
life
.
A
better
life
.
Escape
.
It
was
n't
as
if
she
wanted
much
.
She
did
n't
mind
working
hard
,
not
as
if
she
figured
to
do
anything
wrong
to
live
easy
and
soft
-
all
she
wanted
was
a
chance
,
where
she
was
n't
marked
as
what
she
was
.
To
be
Katharine_Ross
,
and
work
in
a
nicer
shop
somewhere
,
at
a_little
more
money
so
she
could
have
prettier
clothes
,
and
learn
ladies
'
manners
and
all
like
that
,
and
get
to
know
different
people
than
up_to_now
,
not
just
the
ones
like
her
here
,
with
foreign
sounding
names
,
the
ones
went_to
the
same
church
and
-
Different
place
,
different
job
,
different
people
,
she
'd
be
all
different
too
.
Prettier
,
she
'd
do
her
hair
another
way
;
smarter
,
and
wear
different
kinds
of
clothes
-
she
'd
be
Katharine_Ross
,
just
what
that
sounded
like
.
``
You
've
give
me
the
wrong
change
''
,
said
the
customer
sharply
.
``
Think
I
can
n't
count
''
?
Katya
made_up
the
amount
in
indifferent
silence
.
She
was
listening
to
other
voices
,
out
of
the
future
.
Some
of
those
vaguely
imagined
new
,
different
people
.
Oh
,
Katharine
's
awfully
nice
,
and
pretty
too
,
I
like
Katharine
.
Let
's
ask
Katharine
to
go_with
us
,
she
's
always
lots_of
fun
.
Katharine
.
Soon
,
very
soon
now
&
&
&
.
Mendoza
did
n't
wake
until
nearly
nine
thirty
.
It
was
going_to
be
another
hot
day
;
already
the
thermometer
stood
close_to
ninety
.
Alison
was
still
sound
asleep
;
he
made
fresh
coffee
and
searched
through
all
the
desk
drawers
for
more
cigarettes
before
thinking_of
her
handbag
,
and
found
a
crumpled
stray
cigarette
at
its
bottom
,
which
tasted
peculiarly
of
face_powder
.
He
left
a
note
propped
on
the
desk
asking
her
to
call
him
sometime
today
,
and
drove
home
.
After
he
'd
got_out
fresh
liver
for
Bast
,
he
paused
to
look
at
her
crouched
daintily
over
her
dish
.
Surely
she
was
just
a_trifle
fatter
around
the
middle
?
He
seemed
to
remember
reading
somewhere
that
Abyssinians
had
large
litters
,
and
suffered
a
dismaying
vision
of
the
apartment
overrun
with
a
dozen
kittens
.
``
Y_que_sigue_despues
?
-
what
then
''
?
he
asked
her
severely
.
``
A
lot
of
people
are
so
peculiar
that
they
do
n't
like
cats
,
it
's
not
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
find
good
homes
for
kittens
-
and
,
damn_it
,
you
know
very_well
if
I
have
them
around
long
,
impossible
to
give
them
away
!
And
I
suppose
now
that
you
've
finally
grown_up
,
if
a_little
late
,
you
'd
go_on
producing
kittens
every
six
months
or_so
.
Yes
,
well
,
it
's
a
pity
to
spoil
your
girlish
figure
-
which
all
those
kittens
would
do
anyway
-
but
I
think
when
you
've
raised
these
we
'll
just
have
the
vet
fix
it
so
there
won
n't
be
any
more
.
I
wonder
if
the
Carters
would
take
one
.
And
it
's
no
good
looking
at
me
like
that
''
,
as
she
wound
affectionately
around
his
ankles
.
