Directions
are
written
for
those
who
have
had
previous
experience
in
making
pottery
.
Instructions
for
preparing
clay
,
drying
,
glazing
and
firing
are
not
given
.
Basic
pottery
studio
equipment
.
Wooden
butter
molds
and
cookie
presses
.
Ceramic
modeling
clay
:
red
,
white
or
buff
.
Stoneware
clay
for
tiles
.
Glazes
,
one-stroke
ceramic
colors
,
stains
,
cones
as
indicated
in
the
individual
instructions
.
Use
well-wedged
clay
,
free_of
air_bubbles
and
pliable
enough
to
bend
without
cracking
.
Clean
wooden
molds
and
presses
thoroughly
;
they
must
be
free_of
oil
,
wax
and
dust
.
The
size
of
wooden
mold
will
determine
the
amount
of
clay
needed
.
Roll
clay
to
thickness
indicated
in
individual
instructions
.
Whenever
possible
,
use
the
wooden
mold
as
a
pattern
for
cutting
clay
.
When
mold
has
more_than
one
design
cavity
,
make
individual
paper
patterns
.
Place
mold
or
paper
pattern
on
rolled
clay
and
cut
clay
by
holding
knife
in
vertical
position
(
cut
more
pieces
than
required
for
project
to
make
allowance
for
defects
;
experiment
with
defects
for
decoration
techniques
of
glazes
and
colors
)
.
Place
the
cut
clay
piece
loosely
over
the
carved
cavity
design
side
of
wooden
mold
.
To
obtain
clear
impression
of
mold
,
press
clay
gently
but
firmly
into
mold
cavity
,
starting
at
center
and
working
to
outer
edges
.
Trim
excess
clay
away
from
outer
edges
.
Check
thickness
of
clay
and
build_up
thin
areas
by
moistening
surface
with
a_little
water
and
adding
small
pieces
of
clay
.
Be
sure
to
press
the
additional
clay
firmly
into
place
without
locking_in
air_bubbles
.
Allow
project
to
stand
for
about
five
minutes
(
if
wooden
press
mold
is
a
good
antique
,
do
not
leave
clay
in
too
long
as
the
dampness
may
cause
mold
to
crack
)
.
To
release
clay
from
mold
,
place
hands
in
a
cupped
position
around
project
;
gently
lift
the
edge
on
far
side
,
then
continue
to
release
edge
completely
around
mold
.
Slight
tapping
on
the
underside
of
mold
will
help
release
the
clay
,
but
too_much
agitation
will
cause
the
clay
to
become
soft
and
will
interfere
with
removal
of
clay
from
mold
.
Place
a_piece
of
plaster
wall
board
or
plaster
bat
on
clay
and
reverse
bat
,
clay
and
mold
in
one
action
.
This
will
prevent
the
clay
from
twisting
or
bending
,
causing
warping
when
fired
.
Place
project
on
table
and
carefully
lift
the
mold
off
.
Study
surface
of
clay
for
defects
or
desired
corrections
.
If
clay
is
slightly
out
of
shape
,
square
straight
sides
with
guide
sticks
or
rulers
pressed
against
opposite
sides
,
or
smooth
round
pieces
with
damp
fingers
.
if
the
background
of
design
is
too
smooth
,
or
you
wish
to
create
a
wood-grained
effect
,
it
may
be_added
at
this
time
with
a
dull
tool
such_as
the
handle
of
a
fine
paintbrush
.
Make
slight
,
smooth
grooves
rather_than
cuts
for
the
texture
(
cuts
could
cause
air_pockets
under
the
glaze
creating
pinholes
or
craters
in
the
glaze
during
firing
)
.
Leave
the
clay
on
plaster
board
to
dry
slowly
,
covered
lightly
with
a
loose
piece
of
plastic
or
cloth
to
prevent
warping
.
