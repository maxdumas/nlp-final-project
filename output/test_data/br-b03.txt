Sam_Rayburn
was
a
good
man
,
a
good
American
,
and
,
third
,
a
good
Democrat
.
He
was
all_of
these
rolled
into
one
sturdy
figure
;
Mr._Speaker
,
Mr._Sam
,
and
Mr._Democrat
,
at
one_and_the_same
time
.
The
House
was
his
habitat
and
there
he
flourished
,
first
as
a
young
representative
,
then
as
a
forceful
committee
chairman
,
and
finally
in
the
post
for
which
he
seemed
intended
from
birth
,
Speaker
of
the
House
,
and
second
most
powerful
man
in
Washington
.
Mr._Rayburn
was
not
an
easy
man
to
classify
or
to
label
.
He
was
no
flaming
liberal
,
yet
the
New_Deal
,
the
Fair_Deal
and
the
New_Frontier
needed
him
.
He
was
not
a
rear-looking
conservative
,
yet
partisans
of_that
persuasion
will
miss
him
as
much_as
any
.
Two
of
the
vital
qualities
demanded
of
a
politician
by
other
politicians
are
that
he
always
keep
a
confidence
and
that
he
keep
his
word
.
Sam_Rayburn
took
unnumbered
secrets
with
him
to
the
grave
,
for
he
was
never
loquacious
,
and
his
word
,
once
given
,
was
not
subject_to
retraction
.
It
might
be
added
that
as
he
kept
his
word
so
he
expected
that
others
keep
theirs
.
The
demonstration
of
his
power
was
never
flamboyant
or
theatrical
.
His
leadership
was
not
for
audiences
.
A
growl
,
a
nod
,
was
usually
enough
.
When
it
was
not
,
one
of
the
great
dramas
of
Washington
would
be
presented
.
He
would
rise
in
the
well
of
the
House
,
his
chin
upon
his
chest
,
his
hands
gripping
the
side
of
a
desk
,
and
the
political
and
legislative
chatter
would
subside
into
silence
.
He
spoke
briefly
,
sensibly
,
to_the_point
and
without
oratorical
flourishes
He
made
good
,
plain
American
common_sense
and
the
House
usually
recognized
it
and
acted
upon
it
.
These
public
efforts
were
rare
because
Mr._Rayburn
normally
did
his
counseling
,
persuading
and
educating
long
before
an
issue
reached
its
test
on
the
House
floor
.
He
expected
Democrats
to
do
their
duty
when
it
had
been
patiently
pointed_out
to
them
.
With
his
long
service
he
had
a
long
memory
,
an
excellent
thing
in
a
political_leader
.
He
was
,
of_course
,
in
the
House
for
a_very_long_time
.
There
are
only
two
men
remaining
in
Congress
who
,
with
Rayburn
,
voted
for
the
declaration
of
war
against
Germany
in
1917
.
To
almost
two
generations
of
Americans
it
must
have
seemed
as
though
the
existence
of
Mr._Sam
coincided
with_that
of
the
House
.
And
it
was
the
House
he
loved
.
To
be
presiding_officer
of_it
was
the
end
of
his
desire
and
ambition
.
The
Senate
to
him
was
not
the
``
upper
body
''
and
he
corrected
those
who
said
he
served
``
under
''
the
president
.
He
served
``
with
''
him
.
Sound
the
roll
of
those
with
whom
he
served
and
who
preceded
him
in
death
.
Woodrow_Wilson
,
with
whom
he
began
his
years
in
Washington
,
Warren_G._Harding
,
Calvin_Coolidge
,
FDR
,
with
whom
he
managed
a
social
revolution
.
And
those
still
with
us
,
Herbert_C._Hoover
,
Harry_S._Truman
,
Dwight_D._Eisenhower
and
John_F._Kennedy
.
He
was
a
fighter
for
those
of
his
own
party
.
Mr._Truman
has
only
to
recall
the
``
hopeless
''
campaign
of
1948
to
remember
what
a
loyal
partisan
he
was
and
the
first
experience
of
Mr._Kennedy
with
Congress
would
have
been
sadder
than
it
was
had
not
Mr._Sam
been
there
.
As
it
was
,
his
absence
because
of
his
final
illness
was
a
blow
to
the
administration
.
With
Republican
presidents
,
he
fought
fair
.
He
was
his
own
man
,
not
an
automatic
obstructionist
.
He
kept
his
attacks
on
Republicanism
for
partisan
campaigns
,
but
that
is
part
of
the
game
he
was_born
to
play
.
Under
any
name
-
Mr._Speaker
,
Mr._Democrat
,
Mr._Sam
-
he
was
a
good
man
.
Thirteen
Italian
airmen
who
went_to
the
Congo
to
serve
the
cause
of
peace
under
the
United_Nations
banner
have
instead
met
violent_death
at
the
hands
of
Congolese
troops
supposedly
their
friends
.
In
18
months
,
no_more
grisly
incident
has
been
reported
from_that
jungle
.
Simply
out
of
bloodlust
,
their
murderers
dismembered
the
bodies
and
tossed
the
remains
into
the
river
.
The
excuse
was
offered
for
them
that
they
had
mistaken
the
Italians
for
Belgian
mercenaries
.
In_other_words
,
atrocities
by
savages
wearing
the
uniform
of
the
central
government
might
be
condoned
,
had
the
victims
been
serving
the
cause
of
dissident
Katanga
.
Does
this
suggest
that
the
Congo
is
fit
for
nationhood
or
that
UN
is
making
any
progress
whatever
toward
its
goal
of
so
making_it
?
To_the_contrary
,
through
the
past
six
weeks
violence
has
been
piled
upon
violence
.
Mass
rapes
,
troop
mutinies
,
uncontrolled
looting
and
pillage
and
reckless
military
adventures
,
given
no
sanction
by
any
political
authority
,
have
become
almost
daily
occurrences
.
Yet
this
basic
condition
of
outlawry
and
anarchy
is
not
the
work
of
Katanga
.
It
happens
in
the
territory
of
the
Leopoldville
government
,
which
is
itself
a
fiction
,
demonstrably
incapable_of
governing
,
and
commanding
only
such
limited
credit
abroad
as
UN
support
gives
it
.
The
main
question
raised
by
the
incident
is
how
much
longer
will
UN
bury
its
head
in
the
sand
on
the
Congo
problem
instead
of
facing
the
bitter
fact
that
it
has
no
solution
in
present
terms
?
The
probable
answer
is
that
it
will
do
so
just_as
long
as
Russia
can
exercise
a
veto
in
favor
of
chaos
and
until
young
African_nations
wake_up
to
the
truth
that
out
of
false
pride
they
are
visiting
ruin
on
Central_Africa
.
Right_now
,
they
are
pushing
a
resolution
which
would
have
UN
use
its
forces
to
invade
and
subjugate
Katanga
.
That
notion
is
fantastically
wrong-headed
from
several
points_of_view
.
The
UN
army
is
too
weak
,
too
demoralized
for
the
task
.
Further
,
it
has
its
work
cut_out
stopping
anarchy
where
it
is
now
garrisoned
.
Last
,
it
makes
no
sense
to
deliver
Katanga
,
the
one
reasonably
solid
territory
,
into
the
existing
chaos
.
The
Congo
should
have
been
mandated
,
because
it
was
not_ready
for
independence
.
The
idea
was
not
even
suggested
because
political
expediency
prevailed
over
wisdom
.
It
is
perhaps
too
late
now
to
talk
of
mandate
because
it
is
inconsistent
with
what
is
termed
political
realism
.
But
if
any
realism
and
feeling
for
truth
remain
in
the
General_Assembly
,
it
is
time
for
men
of
courage
to
measure
the
magnitude
of
the
failure
and
urge
some
new
approach
.
Otherwise
,
UN
will
march
blindly
on
to
certain
defeat
.
A
recent
editorial
discussing
a
labor-management
agreement
reached
between
the
Southern_Pacific_Co.
and
the
Order
of
Railroad
Telegraphers
has
been
criticized
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
based
on
complete
information
.
The
editorial
was
based
on
a
news
association
dispatch
which
said
that
the
telegraphers
had
secured
an
agreement
whereby
they
were
guaranteed
40
hours
'
pay
per
week
whether
they
worked
or
not
and
that
a
reduction
in
their
number
was
limited
to
2
per_cent
per_year
.
Our
comment
was
that
this
was
``
featherbedding
''
in
its
ultimate
form
and
that
sympathy
for
the
railroad
was
misplaced
since
it
had
entered
into
such
an
agreement
.
The
statement
was
also
made
that
undoubtedly
the
railroad
had
received
some
compensating
benefit
from
the
telegraphers
,
but
that
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
what
could
balance
a
job
for
life
.
Additional
information
supplied
to
us
discloses
that
the
railroad
gained
a
stabilized
supply
of
telegraphers
of_which
it
was
in
need
.
Also
,
normal
personal
attrition
would
make
the
job
reduction
provision
more_or_less
academic
.
The
situation
with
regard_to
the
Southern_Pacific
was
therefore
a
special
one
and
not
necessarily
applicable
to
other
situations
in
other
industries
.
The
solution
reached
in
the
agreement
was
more
acceptable
to
the
railroad
than
that
originally
included
in_a_series
of
union
demands
.
Time
was
when
the
house
of
delegates
of
the
American_Bar
association
leaned
to
the
common_sense
side
.
But
the
internationalists
have
taken_over
the
governing
body
of
the
bar
,
and
when
the
lads
met
in
St._Louis
,
it
was
not
to
grumble
about
the
humidity
but
to
vote
unanimously
that
the
United_Nations
was
scarcely
less_than
wonderful
,
despite
an
imperfection
here_and_there
.
It
was
,
the
brief
writers
decided
,
``
man
's
best
hope
for
a
peaceful
and
law
abiding
world
''
.
Peace
,
it
's
wonderful
,
and
``
world
law
''
,
it
's
wonderful
,
too
,
and
should
n't
we
get
an
international
covenant
extending
it
into
space
,
before
the
Russians
put
some
claim
jumper
on
the
moon
?
Meanwhile
,
in
Moscow
,
Khrushchev
was
adding
his
bit
to
the
march
of
world
law
by
promising
to
build
a
bomb
with
a
wallop
equal_to
100
million
tons
of
TNT
,
to
knock
sense
into
the
heads
of
those
backward
oafs
who
can
n't
see
the
justice
of
surrendering
West_Berlin
to
communism
.
A
nuclear
pacifier
of
these
dimensions
-
roughly
some
six
and
a
half_times
bigger
than
anything
the
United_States
has
triggered
experimentally
-
would
certainly
produce
a
bigger
bang
,
and
,
just
for
kicks
,
Khrushchev
might
use
it
to
propel
the
seminar
of
the
house
of
delegates
from
St._Louis
to
the
moon
,
where
there
would
n't
even
be
any
beer
to
drink
.
While
he
was
at
it
,
the
philosopher
of
the
Kremlin
contributed
an
additional
assist
to
the
rule
of
reason
by
bellowing
at
those
in
the
west
who
can
n't
appreciate
coexistence
thru
suicide
.
``
Fools
''
,
he
bayed
,
``
what
do
you
think
you
are
doing
''
?
The
only
response
we
can
think_of
is
the
humble
one
that
at_least
we
are
n't
playing
the
marimba
with
our
shoes
in
the
United_Nations
,
but
perhaps
the
heavy
domes
in
the
house
of
delegates
can
improve
on
this
feeble
effort
.
Another
evidence
of
the
spreading
rule
of
reason
was
provided
from
Mexico_City
with
the
daily
hijacking
of
an
American_plane
by
a
demented
Algerian
with
a
gun
.
The
craft
made
the
familiar
unwelcome
flight
to
Havana
,
where
,
for
some
unknown
reason
,
Castro
rushed
to
the
airport
to
express
mortification
to
the
Colombian
foreign_minister
,
a
passenger
,
who
is
not
an
admirer
of
old
Ten
O
'
Clock_Shadow
.
The
plane
was
sent
back
to
the
United_States
,
for
a
change
,
but
Castro
kept
the
crazy
gunman
,
who
will
prove
a
suitable
recruit
to
the
revolution
.
Less
respect
for
the
legal
conventions
was
displayed
by
Castro
's
right_hand
man
,
Che_Guevara
,
who
edified
the
Inter-American
Economic_and_Social_council
meeting
in
Montevideo
by
reading
two
secret
American
documents
purloined
from
the
United_States
embassy
at
Caracas
,
Venezuela
.
The
contents
were
highly
embarrassing
to
American
spokesmen
,
who
were
on_hand
to
promise
Latin_Americans
a
20
billion
dollar
foreign
aid
millennium
.
Perhaps
the
moralities
of
world
law
are
not
advanced
by
stealing
American
diplomatic
papers
and
planes
,
but
the
Kennedy
administration
can
always
file
a
demurrer
to
the
effect
that
,
but
for
its
own
incompetence
in
protecting
American
interests
,
these
things
would
not
happen
.
The
same
can
be
said
about
the
half-hearted
Cuban
invasion
mounted
by
the
administration
last
April
,
which
,
we
trust
,
is
not
symptomatic_of
the
methods
to
be
invoked
in
holding_off
the
felonious
Khrushchev
.
Pass
the
iron
rations
,
please
,
and
light
another
candle
,
for
it
's
getting
dark
down
here
and
we
're
minded
to
read
a_bit
of
world
law
just
to
pass
the
time
away
.
The
board
of
suspension
of
the
Interstate_Commerce
commission
has
ordered
a
group
of
railroads
not
to
reduce
their
freight_rates
on
grain
,
as
they
had
planned
to
do
this
month
.
The
request
for
lower
rates
originated
with
the
Southern
railway
,
which
has
spent
a
good_deal
of
time
and
money
developing
a
100
-
ton
hopper
car
with
which
it
says
it
can
move
grain
at
about
half
what
it
costs
in
the
conventional
,
smaller
car
.
By
reducing
rates
as
much_as
60
per_cent
,
it
and
its
associated
railroads
hope
to
win_back
some
of
the
business
they
have
lost
to
truckers
and
barge
lines
.
The
board
's
action
shows
what
free_enterprise
is
up
against
in
our
complex
maze
of
regulatory
laws
.
