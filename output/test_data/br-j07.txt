The
Poynting-Robertson
effect
(
Robertson
,
1937
;
Wyatt
and
Whipple
,
1950
)
,
which
is
a
retardation
of
the
orbital
motion
of
particles
by
the
relativistic
aberration
of
the
repulsive_force
of
the
impinging
solar_radiation
,
causes
the
dust
to
spiral
into
the
sun
in
times
much
shorter
than
the
age
of
the
Earth
.
The
radial
velocity
varies
inversely
as
the
particle
size
-
a
1000
-
|
m
diameter
particle
near
the
orbit
of
Mars
would
reach
the
sun
in
about
60
million
years
.
Whipple
(
1955
)
extends
the
effects
to
include
the
solar
corpuscular_radiation
pressure
,
which
increases
both
the
minimum
particle
size
and
the
drag
.
Further
,
the
corpuscular_radiation
,
i.e.
,
the
solar_wind
protons
,
must
sputter
away
the
surface
atoms
of
the
dust
and
cause
a
slow
diminution
in
size
,
with
a
resultant
increase
in
both
the
Poynting-Robertson
effect
and
the
ratio
of
the
repulsive_force
to
the
gravitational_force
.
The
Poynting-Robertson
effect
causes
the
semi
major_axis
of
orbits
to
diminish
more
rapidly
than
the
semi-minor_axis
,
with
a
consequent
tendency
toward
circular
orbits
as
the
particles
move
toward
the
sun
.
Also
,
planetary
gravitational_attraction
increases
the
dust
concentration
near
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
as
the
sun
is
approached
.
At
one
astronomical_unit
from
the
sun
(
the
Earth
's
distance
)
the
dust
orbits
are
probably
nearly
circular
.
If
such
is
the
case
,
the
particles
within
a
distance
of
about
*
*
f
km
of
the
Earth
will
have
,
relative
to
the
Earth
,
a
kinetic_energy
less
than
their
potential_energy
and
they
will
be
captured
into
orbits
about
the
Earth
.
De_Jager
(
1955
)
has
calculated
the
times
required
for
these
particles
to
reach
the
atmosphere
under
the
influence
of
the
Poynting-Robertson
effect
,
which
in
this
case
causes
the
orbits
to
become
more_and_more
eccentric
without
changing
the
semi
major_axis
.
This
effect
can
give_rise
to
a
blanket
of
micrometeorites
around
the
Earth
.
Since
there
is
a
continual
loss
of
micrometeoritic
material
in
space
because
of
the
radiation
effects
,
there
must
be
a
continual
replenishment
:
otherwise
,
micrometeorites
would
have
disappeared
from
interplanetary_space
.
There
are
several
possible
sources
.
According_to
Whipple
(
1955
)
,
cometary
debris
is
sufficient
to
replenish
the
material
spiraling
into
the
sun
,
maintaining
a
fairly
steady
state
.
Asteroidal
collisions
are
also
thought
to
contribute
material
.
It
is
also
possible
that
some
of
the
dust
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Earth
originated
from
meteoritic
impacts
upon
the
moon
.
One
cannot
make
a
very
satisfactory
guess
about
the
micrometeorite
flux
in
space
.
Even
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
Earth
,
where
information
has
been
obtained
both
directly
and
indirectly
,
the
derived
flux
values
vary
by
at_least
four
orders_of_magnitude
.
This
large
discrepancy
demonstrates
the
inadequacies
of
the
experimental
methods
and
the
lack
of
understanding
of
the
various
phenomena
involved
.
Beyond
a_few
million
kilometers
from
the
Earth
,
but
still
in
the
region
of
the
Earth
's
orbit
,
a
prediction
of
the
flux
of
dust
is
even
more
unreliable
.
At
greater
distances
from
the
sun
,
the
situation
is
still
less
certain
.
There
are
several
sources
of
evidence
on
the
micrometeorite
environment
.
Direct
information
has
been
obtained
from
rockets
and
satellites
equipped
with
impact
sensors
.
In_addition
,
the
size
distribution
obtained
from
visual
and
radar
observations
of
meteors
may
be
extrapolated
to
the
micrometeorite
domain
.
From
the
brightness
of
the
F
component
of
the
solar
corona
and
the
brightness
of
the
zodiacal_light
,
an
estimate
of
the
particle
sizes
,
concentrations
,
and
spatial
distribution
can
be
derived
for
regions
of
space
near
the
ecliptic
plane
.
Another
important
source
of
evidence
only
recently
receiving
much
attention
is
the
analysis
of
atmospheric
dust
for
a
meteoritic
component
.
The
cores
of
deep
sea
sediments
and
content
of
collectors
in
remote
regions
are
valuable
in
this
category
.
The
data
provide
a
measure
of
the
total
mass
of
cosmic
material
incident
upon
the
Earth
.
The
direct_evidence
on
the
micrometeorite
environment
near
the
Earth
is
obtained
from
piezoelectric
sensors
(
essentially
microphones
)
and
from
wire
gages
;
these
instruments
are
installed
on
rockets
,
satellites
,
and
space_probes
.
Statistically
,
the
most
significant
data
have
been
collected
from
the
sensors
on
1958
Alpha
(
Explorer_1
,
)
,
1958
Delta_2
(
Sputnik
3
,
)
,
and
1959
Eta
(
Vanguard
3
,
)
.
These
vehicles
,
with
large
sensitive
areas
,
have
collected
data
for
long
enough
times
to
give
reliable
impact
rates
for
the
periods
of
exposure
.
Many
other
vehicles
with
smaller
sensitive
area
exposure
time
products
contribute
some
information
.
The
impact
rate
on
1958
Alpha
for
153
events
was
*
*
f
for
particles
of
mass
greater
than
*
*
f
(
Dubin
,
1960
)
;
this
mass
threshold
was
derived
from
the
detector
calibration
and
an
assumed
impact
velocity
of
*
*
f
.
The
data
show
daily
and
diurnal_variations
.
Ninety
per_cent
of
the
153
recorded
impacts
occurred
between
midnight
and
noon
,
and
from
day
to
day
the
variation
of
the
rate
was
as
much
as
an
order_of_magnitude
.
One
may
conclude
that
most_of
the
detected
micrometeoritic
material
is
concentrated
in
orbital
streams
which
intersect
the
Earth
's
orbit
.
There
have
been
contradictory
reports
from
1958
Delta_2
,
and
the
data
quoted
here
are
believed
to
be
the
more
reliable
.
On
May
15
,
a
very
large
increase
occurred
with
*
*
f
of
mass
between
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
;
for
the
next
two
days
,
the
impact
rate
was
*
*
f
;
and
for
the
next
nine
days
,
the
impact
rate
was
less_than
*
*
f
(
Nazarova
,
1960
)
.
The
data
for
the
first
day
indicate
a
meteor_stream
with
a
very
high
concentration
of
particles
and
may
have
led
to
the
high
estimates
of
micrometeorite
flux
.
Preliminary
data
from
1959_Eta
give
an
average
impact
rate
of
*
*
f
for
masses
larger
than
*
*
f
for
about
1000
events
in
a
22
-
day
period
(
LaGow
and
Alexander
,
1960
)
.
The
day-to-day
rate
varied
by
less_than
a
factor
of
4.5
.
The
data
have
not_yet
been
analyzed
for
diurnal_variations
.
Note
that
the
mass
threshold
is
four_times
that
of
1958_Alpha
and
that
the
flux
is
one_fifth
as
large
.
If
one
assumes
that
the
average
flux
did
not
change
between
measurements
,
a
mass
distribution
curve
is
obtained
which
relates
the
flux
of
particles
larger
than
a
given
radius
to
the
inverse
7
2
power
of
the
radius
.
Space_probes
have
yielded
little
information
.
Pioneer_1
,
recorded
a
decrease
in
flux
with
distance
from
the
Earth
on
the
basis
of
11
counts
in
9
hours
.
With
detectors
sensitive
to
three
mass
intervals
and
based
on
a_few
counts
,
the
second
and
third
Russian
space_probes
indicate
that
the
flux
of
the
smallest
particles
detected
is
less_than
that
of
larger
ones
.
Being
based
on
so
few
events
,
these
results
are
of
dubious
validity
.
The
calibration
of
piezoelectric
sensors
in_terms_of
the
particle
parameters
is
very
uncertain
.
Many
workers
believe
that
the
response
is
proportional
to
the
incident
momentum
of
the
particles
,
a
relation
deduced
from
laboratory
results
linearly
extrapolated
to
meteoritic
velocities
.
However
,
one
must
expect
that
vaporization
and
ejection
of
material
by
hypervelocity
impacts
would
cause
a
deviation
from
a
linear
relationship
.
In
the
United_States
,
most_of
the
sensors
are
calibrated
by
dropping
small
spheres
on
their
sensitive
surfaces
.
The
Russian
experimenters
claim
that
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
impulse
from
the
sensors
is
caused
by
the
incident
momentum
with
the
remainder
being
momentum
of
ejected
material
from
the
sensor
.
This
``
ejection
''
momentum
is
linearly
related
to
the
particle
energy
.
They
quote
about
the
same
mass
threshold
as
that
of
the
U.S.
apparatus
,
but
a
momentum
threshold
about
40
times
greater
.
There
is
a
difference
in
the
experimental
arrangement
,
in_that
the
U.S.
microphones
are
attached
directly
to
the
vehicle
skin
while
the
Russian
instruments
are
isolated
from
the
skin
.
The
threshold
mass
is
derived
from
the
momentum
threshold
with
the
assumption
of
a
mean
impact
velocity
of
*
*
f
in
the
U.S.
work
and
*
*
f
in
the
U.S.S.R.
work
.
The
threshold
mass
of
about
*
*
f
corresponds
to
a
10
-
|
m
diameter
sphere
of
density
*
*
f
.
However
,
the
conversion
from
mass
to
size
is
unreliable
,
since
many
photographic
meteors
give
evidence
of
a
fluffy
,
loosely
bound
meteorite
structure
with
densities
as
low
as
*
*
f
.
To_what_extent
such
low_density
applies
to
micrometeorites
is
unknown
.
The
velocity
value
used
is
also
open_to
some
question
;
if
a
substantial
fraction
of
the
dust
is
orbiting
about
the
Earth
,
only
about
one_third
the
above_mentioned
average
velocity
should
be
used
in
deriving
the
mass
.
Zodiacal_light
and
the
gegenschein
give
some
evidence
for
such
a
dust
blanket
,
a
phenomenon
also
to
be
expected
if
the
dust
before
capture
is
in
circular
orbits
about
the
sun
,
as
indicated
by
the
trend
of
the
smaller
visible
meteors
.
The
diurnal_variation
in
the
observed
flux
may
be
partly
due_to
the
dependence
of
the
detector
sensitivity
on
the
incident
velocity
.
The
flux
of
micrometeorites
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
Earth
can
be
estimated
by
extrapolation
from
radar
and
visual
meteor
data
.
A
summary
of
meteorite
data
,
prepared
by
Whipple
(
1958
)
on
the
basis
of
photographic
,
visual
,
and
radar
evidence
,
is
given
in
Table
5
-
1
.
From
an
estimated
mass
of
25
g
for
a
zero
magnitude
meteorite
,
the
other
masses
are
derived
with
the
assumption
of
a
mass
decrease
by
a
factor
of
2.512
for
each
unit
increase
in
magnitude
.
The
radius
is
calculated
from
the
mass
by
assuming
spheres
of
density
*
*
f
except
for
the
smallest
particles
,
which
must
have
a
higher
mass
density
to
remain
in
the
solar_system
in
the
presence
of
solar_radiation
pressure
.
The
flux
values
are
for
all
particles
with
masses
greater
than
the
given
mass
and
are
based
on
an
estimate
of
the
numbers
of
visual
meteors
.
It
is
assumed
that
the
flux
values
increase
by
a
factor
of
2.512
per
magnitude
,
in
accordance
with
the
opinion
that
the
total
mass
flux
in
each
unit
range
in
magnitude
is
constant
.
The
values
agree
with
the
data
from
1958_Alpha
and
1959_Eta
.
The
figures
in
the
next-to-last
column
are
derived
with
the
assumption
of
50
per_cent
shielding
by
the
Earth
;
hence
,
these
figures
apply
immediately
above
the
Earth
's
atmosphere
.
The
unshielded
flux
is
given
in
the
last
column
;
these
figures
constitute
the
best
estimate
for
the
flux
in
interplanetary_space
near
the
Earth
.
Of_course
,
if
there
is
a
dust
blanket
around
the
Earth
,
the
fluxes
in
interplanetary_space
should
be
less_than
the
figures
given
here
.
Note
that
the
mass
scale
is
one
to
two
orders_of_magnitude
greater
than
some
previously
used
;
for_example
,
Jacchia
(
1948
)
derived
a
scale
of
0.15
g
for
a
*
*
f
,
zero
magnitude
meteorite
.
The
older
scales
were
based
on
theoretical
estimates
of
the
conversion
efficiency
of
kinetic_energy
into
light
.
The
mass
scale
used
in
Table
5
-
1
was
derived
on
the
assumption
that
the
motion
of
the
glowing
trail
is
related_to
the
momentum
transfer
to
the
trail
by
the
meteorite
,
permitting
the
calculation
of
the
mass
if
the
velocity
is
known
(
Cook
and
Whipple
,
1958
)
.
A
concentration
distribution
has
been
derived
from
radar
observations
sensitive
to
the
fifteenth
magnitude
(
Manning
and
Eshleman
,
1959
)
.
Extrapolation
of
this
relationship
through
the
thirtieth
magnitude
covers
the
range
of
micrometeorites
.
The
approximate
equation
is
*
*
f
,
where
n
is
the
number
of
*
*
f
with
electron
line
density
greater
than
or
equal
to
*
*
f
,
and
q
is
proportional
to
the
mass
of
the
meteorite
.
Therefore
,
n
is
inversely
proportional
to
the
radius
cubed
and
in
fair
agreement
with
the
inverse
7
2
power
derived
from
1958_Alpha
and
1959_Eta
data
.
At
the
fifteenth
magnitude
,
*
*
f
,
and
at
the
twenty-fifth
magnitude
,
*
*
f
.
These
extrapolated
fluxes
are
about
an
order_of_magnitude
less_than
the
values
from
the
satellite
data
and
the
figures
in
Whipple
's
table
.
The
extrapolation
may
be
in
error
for
several
reasons
.
The
observational
data
determining
the
concentration
distribution
have
a
range
of
error
which
is
magnified
in
the
extension
into
the
micrometeorite
region
.
The
solar
electromagnetic
-
and
corpuscular-radiation_pressure
and
the
associated
Poynting-Robertson
effect
increase
in
effectiveness
as
the
particle
size
decreases
and
modify
the
distribution
and
limit
sizes
to
larger
than
a_few
microns
.
Also
,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
source
of
all
or
part
of
the
dust
may
not
be
the
same
as
that
for
visual
or
radar
meteorites
(
Best
,
1960
)
,
and
the
same
distribution
would
not
be
expected
.
A
measure
of
the
total
mass
accretion
of
meteoritic
material
by
the
Earth
is
obtained
from
analyses
of
deep
sea
sediments
and
dust
collected
in
remote
regions
(
Pettersson
,
1960
)
.
Most
meteoritic
material
,
by
the
time
it
reaches
the
Earth's_surface
,
has
been
reduced
to
dust
or
to
spherules
of
ablated
material
in
its
passage
through
the
atmosphere
.
For
all
meteorites
,
the
average
nickel
content
is
about
2.5
per_cent
.
This
is
much
higher
than
the
nickel
content
of
terrestrial
dusts
and
sediments
and
provides
a
basis
for
the
determination
of
the
meteoritic
mass
influx
.
Present
data
indicate
an
accretion
of
about
*
*
f
tons
per_year
over
the
entire
globe
,
or
about
*
*
f
.
