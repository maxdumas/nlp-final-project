Individuals
possessing
unusual
gifts
and
great
personal
power
were
transmuted
at
death
into
awesome
spirits
;
they
were
almost
immediately
worshipped
for
these
newer
,
even
more
terrible
abilities
.
Their
direct
descendants
inherited
not_only
their
worldly
fortunes
,
but
also
the
mandate
of
their
newfound
power
as
spirits
in
the
other
half
of
the
universe
.
Royal
lineages
could
be
based
on
extraordinary
worldly
achievements
translated
into
eternal
otherworldly
power
.
Thus
,
the
emperor
could
draw
on
sources
not
available
to
those
with
less
puissant
ancestors
.
But
this
eminence
was
not
without
its
weighty
responsibilities
.
Since
he
possessed
more
power
in
an
interdependent
universe
of
living
beings
and
dead
spirits
,
the
emperor
had
to
use
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
living
.
The
royal
ritual
generated
power
into
the
other
world
:
it
also
provided
the
living
with
a
way
to
control
the
spirits
,
and
bring
their
powers
directly
to
bear_on
the
everyday
affairs
of
the
world
.
Proper
ritual
observance
at
any
level
of
society
was
capable_of
generating
power
for
use
in
the
spirit_world
;
but
naturally
,
the
royal
ritual
,
which
provided
unusual
control
over
already
supremely
powerful
divine
spirits
,
was
held
responsible_for
regulating
the
universe
and
insuring
the
welfare
of
the
kingdom
.
This
is
the
familiar
system
of
``
cosmic
government
''
.
The
Chinese
emperor
,
by
proper
observance
of
ritual
,
manifested
divine
powers
.
He
regulated
the
dualities
of
light
and
darkness
,
Yang
and
Yin
,
which
are
locked
in
eternal
struggle
.
By
swaying
the
balance
between
them
,
he
effected
the
alternation
of
the
seasons
.
His
power
was
so
great
that
he
even
promoted
and
demoted
gods
according
to
whether
they
had
given_ear
or
been
deaf_to
petitions
.
In_this
system
,
no
man
is
exempt
from
obligations
.
Failure
in
daily
moral
and
ethical
duties
to
one
's
family
,
outrages
to
community
propriety
,
any
departure
from
rigid
standards
of
moral_excellence
were
offenses
against
the
dead
.
And
to
offend
the
dead
meant
to
incur
their
wrath
,
and
thus
provoke
the
unleashing
of
countrywide
disasters
.
The
family
home
was
,
in_fact
,
a
temple
;
and
the
daily
duties
of
individuals
were
basically
religious
in
nature
.
The
dead
spirits
occupied
a
prominent
place
in
every
hope
and
in
every
fear
.
The
common
belief
was
that
there
existed
one
moral
order
,
which
included
everything
.
The
dead
controlled
the
material
prosperity
of
the
living
,
and
the
living
adhered
to
strict
codes_of_conduct
in_order
not
to
weaken
that
control
.
Men
believed
they
could
control
nature
by
obeying
a
moral
code
.
If
the
moral
code
were
flouted
,
the
proper
balance
of
the
universe
would
be
upset
,
and
the
disastrous
result
could
be
floods
,
plague
,
or
famine
.
Modern
Westerners
have
difficulty
comprehending
this
fusion
of
moral
and
material
,
largely
because
in
the
West
the
historical
trend
has
been
to
deny
the
connection
.
Living
in
urban
conditions
,
away
from
the
deadweight
of
village
constraint
and
the
constrictions
of
a
thatched-roof
world_view
,
the
individual
may
find
it
possible
,
say
,
to
commit
adultery
not_only
without
personal
misgivings
,
but
also
without
suffering
any
adverse
effects
in
his
worldly
fortunes
.
Basing
action
on
the
empirical
determination
of
cause
and
effect
provides
a
toughness
and
bravado
that
no
powerful
otherworldly
ancestor
could
ever
impart
-
plus
the
added
liberation
from
the
constraint
of
silent
burial
urns
.
In
China
,
the
magical
system
par_excellence
was
Taoism
.
The
Taoists
were
Quietist
mystics
,
who
saw
an
unchanging
unity
-
the
Tao
-
underlying
all
phenomena
.
It
was
this
timeless
unity
that
was
all-important
,
and
not
its
temporary
manifestations
in
the
world
of
reality
.
The
Taoists
believed
the
unity
could
be
influenced
by
proper
magical
manipulation
;
in_other_words
,
they
were
actually
an
organization
of
magicians
.
Mahayana_Buddhism
was
no
exception
to
these
prevailing
magical
concepts
.
After
this
form
of
Indian_Buddhism
had
been
introduced
into
China
,
it
underwent
extensive
changes
.
During
its
flowering
in
the
sixth
to
the
eighth
centuries
,
Mahayana
offered
a
supernatural
package
to
the
Chinese
which
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
highly
digested
philosophical
Zen
morsels
offered
to
the
modern
Western
reader
.
Mahayana
had
gods
,
and
magic
,
a
pantheon
,
heavens
and
hells
,
and
gorgeously
appareled
priests
,
monks
,
and
nuns
,
all_of
whom
wielded
power
over
souls
in
the
other
world
.
The
self-realized
Mahayana
saint
possessed
superhuman
powers
and
magic
.
The
Mahayana
that
developed
in_the_north
was
a
religion
of
idolatry
and
coarse
magic
,
that
made
the
world
into
a
huge
magical
garden
.
In
its
monastic
form
,
Mahayana
was
merely
an
organization
of
magic-practicing
monks
(
bonzes
)
,
who
catered
to
the
Chinese
faith
in
the
supernatural
.
Nonmagical_Confucianism
was
a
secular
,
rational
philosophy
,
but
even
with
this
different
orientation
it
could
not
escape_from
the
ethos
of
a
cosmic
government
.
Confucianism
had
its
own
magic
in
the
idea
that
virtue
had
power
.
If
a
man
lived
a
classical
life
,
he
need
not
fear
the
spirits
-
for
only
lack
of
virtue
gave
the
spirits
power
over
him
.
But
let
us
not
be
mistaken
about
Confucian
``
virtue
''
;
this
was
not
virtue
as
we
understand
the
word
today
,
and
it
did
not
mean
an
abandonment
of
the
belief
in
magic
manipulation
.
To
the
Confucian
,
``
virtue
''
simply
meant
mastery
and
correct
observance
of
three
hundred
major
rules
of
ritual
and
three
thousand
minor
ones
.
Propriety
was
synonymous
with
ritual
observance
,
the
mark
of
a
true
gentleman
.
To
live
correctly
in
an
interdependent
moral
and
material
universe
of
living
and
dead
was
decisive
for
man
's
fate
.
This
,
in_brief
,
was
the
historical
background
out
of_which
Zen
emerged
.
Promoters
of
Zen
to
the
West
record
its
ancestry
,
and
recognize
that
Zen
grew
out
of
a
combination
of
Taoism
and
Indian_Mahayana_Buddhism
.
But
the
``
marvelous
person
''
that
is
supposed
to
result
from
Zen
exhibits
more
Chinese
practicality
than
Indian
speculation
-
he
possesses
magical_powers
,
and
can
use
them
to
order
nature
and
to
redeem
souls
.
Proponents
of
Zen
to
the
West
emphasize
disproportionately
the
amount
of
Mahayana_Buddhism
in
Zen
,
probably
in_order_to
dignify
the
indisputably
magical
Taoist
ideas
with
more
respectable
Buddhist
metaphysic
.
But
in
the
Chinese
mind
,
there
was
little
difference
between
the
two
-
the
bonzes
were
no_more
metaphysical
than
a
magician
has_to
be
.
Actually
,
Zen
owes
more
to
Chinese
Quietism
than
it
does
to
Mahayana_Buddhism
.
The
Ch
'
an
(
Zen
)
sect
may
have
derived
its
metaphysic
from
Mahayana
,
but
its
psychology
was
pure
early
Taoist
.
This
is_well
evidenced
by
the
Quietist
doctrines
carried_over
in
Zen
:
the
idea
of
the
inward
turning
of
thought
,
the
enjoinder
to
put
aside
desires
and
perturbations
so_that
a
return
to
purity
,
peace
,
and
stillness
-
a
union
with
the
Infinite
,
with
the
Tao
-
could
be
effected
.
In_fact
,
the
antipathy
to
outward
ceremonies
hailed
by
modern
exponents
as
so
uniquely
characteristic
of
the
``
direct
thinking
''
Zennist
was
a
feature
of
Taoism
.
So
,
too
,
was
the
insistence
on
the
relativity
of
the
external
world
,
and
the
ideas
that
language
and
things
perceived
by
consciousness
were
poor
substitutes
indeed
for
immediate
perception
by
pure
,
indwelling
spirit
:
the
opposition
of
pure
consciousness
to
ratiocinating
consciousness
.
Zen
maintains
that
cognitive
things
are
only
the
surface
of
experience
.
One
of
its
features
attractive
to
the
West
is
its
irreverence
for
tradition
and
dogma
and
for
sacred_texts
.
One
patriarch
is
supposed
to
have
relegated
sacred
scriptures
for
use
in
an
outhouse
.
But
this
is
not
the
spirit
of
self-reliant
freedom
of
action
for
which
the
Westerner
mistakes
it
.
It
is
simply
that
in
Taoist
tradition
-
as
in_all
good
mysticisms
-
books
,
words
,
or
any
other
manifestations
that
belong_to
the
normal
state
of
consciousness
are
considered
only
the
surface
of
experience
.
The
truth
-
the
Eternal
Truth
-
is
not
transmittable
by
words
.
Reality
is
considered
not_only
irrelevant
to
the
acquisition
of
higher
knowledge
,
but
a
positive
handicap
.
The
technique
of
reality
confusion
-
the
use
of
paradox
and
riddles
to
shake
the
mind
's
grip
on
reality
-
originated
with
fourth
and
third
century
B._C._Chinese_Quietism
:
the
koan
is
not
basically
a
new
device
.
It
is
important
for
an
understanding
of
Zen
to
realize
that
the
esoteric
preoccupations
of
the
select
few
cannot
be
the
doctrine
of
the
common_man
.
In
the
supernatural
atmosphere
of
cosmic
government
,
only
the
ruling
elite
was
ever
concerned
with
a
kingdom-wide
ordering
of
nature
:
popular
religion
aimed
at
more
personal
benefits
from
magical_powers
.
And
this
is
only
natural
-
witness
the
haste
with
which
modern_man
gobbles
the
latest
``
wonder_drug
''
.
Early
Chinese
anchoritism
was
theoretically
aimed
at
a
mystic
pantheist
union
with
the
divine
,
personal
salvation
being
achieved
when
the
mystical
recluse
united
with
divine
essence
.
But
this
esoteric
doctrine
was
lost
in
the
shuffle
to
acquire
special
powers
.
The
anchorite
strove
,
in_fact
,
to
magically
influence
the
world
of
spirits
in
the
same
way
that
the
divine
emperor
manifested
his
power
.
Thus
,
the
Mahayana
metaphysic
of
mystical
union
for
salvation
was
distilled
down
to
a
bare
self-seeking
,
and
for
this
reason
,
the
mystic
in
Asia
did
not_long
remain
in
isolated
contemplation
.
As
the
Zen
literature
reveals
,
as
soon
as
an
early
Zen
master
attained
fame
in
seclusion
,
he
was_called
out
into
the
world
to
exercise
his
powers
.
The
early
anchorite
masters
attracted
disciples
because
of
their
presumed
ability
to
perform
miracles
.
Exponents
of
Zen
often
insist
that
very
early
Zen
doctrine
opposed
the
rampant
supernaturalism
of
China
,
and
proposed
instead
a
more
mature
,
less
credulous
view
of
the
universe
.
In
support
of_this
,
stories
from
the
early
literature
are
cited
to
show
that
Zen
attacks
the
idea
of
supernatural
power
.
But
actually
these
accounts
reveal
the
supernatural
powers
that
the
masters
were
in_fact
supposed
to
possess
,
as_well
as
the
extreme
degree
of
popular
credulity
:
``
Hwang_Pah
(
O
baku
)
,
one_day
going_up
Mount_Tien_Tai
,
which
was
believed
to
have
been
inhabited
by
Arhats
with
supernatural
powers
,
met
with
a
monk
whose
eyes
emitted
strange
light
.
They
went
along
the
pass
talking
with
each
other
for
a
short
while
until
they
came
to
a
river
roaring
with
torrent
.
There
being
no
bridge
,
the
master
had
to
stop
at
the
shore
;
but
his
companion
crossed
the
river
walking
on
the
water
and
beckoned
to
Hwang_Pah
to
follow
him
.
Thereupon
Hwang_Pah
said
:
''
If
I
knew
thou
art
an
Arhat
,
I
would
have
doubled
you
up
before
thou
got_over
there
``
!
The
monk
then
understood
the
spiritual
attainment
of
Hwang_Pah
,
and
praised
him
as
a
true
Mahayanist
.
(

''
A
second
tale
shows
still
more
clearly
the
kind_of
powers
a
truly
spiritual
monk
could
possess
:
``
On_one_occasion
Yang_Shan
(
Kyo-zan
)
saw
a
stranger
monk
flying
through
the
air
.
When
that
monk
came_down
and
approached
him
with
a
respectful
salutation
,
he
asked
:
''
Where
art
thou
from
``
?
''
Early
this
morning
``
,
replied
the
other
,
''
I
set_out
from
India
``
.
''
Why
``
,
said
the
teacher
,
''
art
thou
so
late
``
?
''
I
stopped
``
,
responded
the
man
,
''
several_times
to
look
at
beautiful
sceneries
``
.
''
Thou
mayst
have
supernatural
powers
``
,
exclaimed
Yang_Shan
,
''
yet
thou
must
give
back
the
Spirit
of
Buddha
to
me
``
.
Then
the
monk
praised
Yang_Shan
saying
:
''
I
have
come
over
to
China
in_order_to
worship
Manjucri
,
and
met
unexpectedly
with
Minor_Shakya
``
,
and
after
giving
the
master
some
palm
leaves
he
brought
from
India
,
went_back
through
the
air
.

''
In
the
popular
Chinese
mind
,
Ch
'
an
(
Zen
)
was
no
exception
to
the
ideas
of
coarse
magic
that
dominated
.
A
closer
look
at
modern
Zen
reveals
many
magical
carryovers
that
are
still
part
of
popular
Zen
attitudes
.
To
the
Zen
monk
the
universe
is
still
populated
with
``
spiritual_beings
''
who
have_to
be
appeased
.
Part
of
the
mealtime
ritual
in
the
Zendo
consists_in
offerings
of
rice
to
the
spiritual_beings
``
.
Modern_Zen
presentation
to
the
West
insists
on
the
anti-authoritarian
,
highly
pragmatic
nature
of
the
Zen
belief
-
scriptures
are
burned
to
make
fire
,
action
is
based
on
direct
self-confidence
,
and_so_on
.
This
picture
of
extreme
self-reliant
individuation
is
difficult
to
reconcile
with
such
Zendo
formulas
as
:
''
O
you
,
demons
and
other
spiritual_beings
,
I
now
offer
this
to
you
,
and
may
this
food
fill_up
the
ten
quarters
of
the
world
and
all
the
demons
and
other
spiritual_beings
be
fed
therewith
.
