It
is
obvious
enough
that
linguists
in_general
have
been
less
successful
in
coping_with
tone_systems
than
with
consonants
or
vowels
.
No
single
explanation
is
adequate_to
account_for
this
.
Improvement
,
however
,
is
urgent
,
and
at_least
three
things
will
be
needed
.
The
first
is
a
wide-ranging
sample
of
successful
tonal
analyses
.
Even
beginning
students
in
linguistics
are
made
familiar
with
an
appreciable
variety
of
consonant_systems
,
both
in
their
general
outlines
and
in
many
specific
details
.
An
advanced
student
has
read
a
considerable
number
of
descriptions
of
consonantal_systems
,
including
some
of
the
more
unusual
types
.
By
contrast
,
even
experienced
linguists
commonly
know
no_more
of
the
range
of
possibilities
in
tone_systems
than
the
over-simple
distinction
between
register
and
contour_languages
.
This
limited
familiarity
with
the
possible
phenomena
has
severely
hampered
work
with
tone
.
Tone
analysis
will
continue
to
be
difficult
and
unsatisfactory
until
a
more
representative
selection
of
systems
is
familar
to
every
practicing
field
linguist
.
Papers
like
these
four
,
if
widely
read
,
will
contribute
importantly
to
improvement
of
our
analytic
work
.
The
second
need
is
better
field
techniques
.
The
great
majority
of
present-day
linguists
fall_into
one
or
more
of
a
number
of
overlapping
types
:
those
who
are
convinced
that
tone
cannot
be
analysed
,
those
who
are
personally
scared
of
tone
and
tone_languages
generally
,
those
who
are
convinced
that
tone
is
merely
an
unnecessary
marginal
feature
in
those
languages
where
it
occurs
,
those
who
have
no
idea
how
to
proceed
with
tone
analysis
,
those
who
take
a
simplistic
view
of
the
whole
matter
.
The
result
has
been
neglect
,
fumbling
efforts
,
or
superficial
treatment
.
As
these
maladies
overlap
,
so
must
the
cure
.
Analyses
such_as
these
four
will
simultaneously
combat
the
assumptions
that
tone
is
impossible
and
that
it
is
simple
.
They
will
give
suggestions
that
can
be
worked_up
into
field
procedures
.
Good
field
techniques
will
not_only
equip
linguists
for
better
work
,
but
also
help
them
overcome
negative
attitudes
.
Actually
,
none
of
these
papers
says
much
directly
about
field
techniques
.
But
it
is
worth
pondering
that
very
little
has
been
published
on
any
phase
of
field
techniques
in
linguistics
.
These
things
have
been
disseminated
by
other
means
,
but
always
in
the
wake
of
extensive
publication
of
analytic
results
.
The
third
need
is
for
better
theory
.
We
should
expect
that
general
phonologic
theory
should
be
as
adequate
for
tone
as
for
consonants
and
vowels
,
but
it
has
not
been
.
This
can
only
be
for
one
of
two
reasons
:
either
the
two
are
quite
different
and
will
require
totally
different
theory
(
and
hence
techniques
)
,
or
our
existing
theories
are
insufficiently
general
.
If
,
as
I
suspect
,
the
problem
is
largely
of
the
second
sort
,
then
development
of
a
theory
better
able
to
handle
tone
will
result
automatically
in
better
theory
for
all
phonologic
subsystems
.
One
issue
that
must
be
faced
is
the
relative
difficulty
of
analysis
of
different
phonologic
subsystems
.
Since
tone_systems
typically
comprise
fewer
units
than
either
consonant
or
vowel_systems
,
we
might
expect
that
they
would
be
the
easiest
part
of
a
phonologic
analysis
.
Actual
practice
does
not
often
work_out
this
way
.
Tone_systems
are
certainly
more
complex
than
the
number
of
units
would
suggest
,
and
often
analytically
more
difficult
than
much
larger
consonantal_systems
.
Welmers
has
suggested
one
explanation
.
Tone_languages
use
for
linguistic
contrasts
speech
parameters
which
also
function
heavily
in
nonlinguistic
use
.
This
may
both
divert
the
attention
of
the
uninitiate
and
cause
confusion
for
the
more
knowledgeable
.
The
problem
is
to
disentangle
the
linguistic
features
of
pitch
from
the
co-occurring
nonlinguistic
features
.
Of_course
,
something
of
the
same
sort
occurs
with
other
sectors
of
the
phonology
:
consonantal
articulations
have
both
a
linguistic
and
an
individual
component
.
But
in_general
the
individual
variation
is
a
small
thing
added
onto
basic
linguistic
features
of
greater
magnitude
.
With
tone
,
individual
differences
may
be
greater
than
the
linguistic
contrasts
which
are
superimposed
on
them
.
Pitch
differences
from
one
speaker
to
another
,
or
from
one
emotional_state
to
another
,
may
far
exceed
the
small
differences
between
tones
.
However
,
any
such
suggestion
accounts_for
only
some
of
the
difficulties
in
hearing
tone
,
or
in
developing
a
realistic
attitude
about
tone
,
but
not
for
the
analytic
difficulties
that
occur
even
when
tone
is
meticulously
recorded
.
A
second
explanation
is
suggested
by
the
material
described
in
Rowlands
'
paper
.
Tone
and
intonation
often
become
seriously
intermeshed
.
Neither
can
be
adequately
systematized
until
we
are
able
to
separate
the
two
and
assign
the
observed
phenomena
individually
to
one
or
the
other
.
Other
pairs
of
phonologic
subsystems
also
interact
or
overlap
in
this
way
;
for_example
,
duration
sometimes
figures
in
both
the
vowel_system
and
the
intonation
.
Some
phonetic
features
,
for_example
glottal_catch
or
murmur
,
are
sometimes
to
be
assigned
to
segmental
phonemics
and
sometimes
to
accentual_systems
.
But
no
other
two
phonologic_systems
are
as
difficult
to
disentangle
as
are
tone
and
intonation
in
some
languages
.
This
explanation
of
tone
difficulties
,
however
,
does
not
apply
in
all
languages
.
In
some
(
the
Ewe
type
mentioned
above
)
interaction
of
tone
and
intonation
is
restricted
to
the
ends
of
intonation
spans
.
In
many
of
the
syllables
,
intonation
can
be
safely
ignored
,
and
much
of
the
tonal
analysis
can
be
done
without
any
study
of
intonation
.
Still
,
even
in
such
languages
tone
analysis
has
not
been
as
simple
as
one
might
expect
.
A
third
explanation
is
suggested
by
Richardson
's
analysis
of
Sukuma
tone
.
There
we
see
a
basically
simple
phonemic_system
enmeshed
in
a
very
complex
and
puzzling
morphophonemic_system
.
While
the
phonemes
can
be
very
easily
stated
,
no
one
is
likely
to
be
satisfied
with
the
statement
until
phonemic
occurrences
can
be
related
in_some_way
to
morphemic
units
,
i._e.
until
the
morphophonemics
is
worked_out
,
or
at_least
far
enough
that
it
seems
reasonable
to
expect
success
.
In
the
``
typical
tone_language
''
,
tonal
morphophonemics
is
of
the
same
order
of
complexity
as
consonantal
morphophonemics
.
The
phonemic_systems
which
must
support
these
morphophonemic_systems
,
however
,
are
very
different
.
The
inventory
of
tones
is
much
smaller
,
and
commonly
the
contrasts
range
along
one
single
dimension
,
pitch
level
.
Consonantal_systems
are
not
merely
larger
,
they
are
multidimensional
.
Morphophonemic
rules
may
be
thought_of
as
joining
certain
points
in
the
system
.
The
possibilities
in
the
consonantal_system
are
very
numerous
,
and
only
a
small
portion
of
them
are
actually
used
.
Phonemes
connected
by
a
morphophonemic
rule
commonly
show
a
good
bit
of
phonetic
similarity
,
possible
because
of
the
several
dimensions
of
contrast
in
the
system
.
Tonal
morphophonemics
,
in
a
common
case
,
can
do
nothing
but
either
raise
or
lower
the
tone
.
The
possibilities
are
few
,
and
the
total
number
of
rules
may
be
considerably
greater
.
Often
,
therefore
,
there
are
a
number
of
rules
having
the
same
effect
,
and
commonly
other
sets
of
rules
as_well
,
having
the
opposite
effect
.
Tonal
morphophonemics
is
much
more
confusing
to
the
beginning
analyst
than
consonantal
morphophonemics
,
even
when
the
total
number
of
rules
is
no
greater
.
The
difficulty
of
analysis
of
any
subsystem
in
the
phonology
is
an
inverse_function
of
the
size
-
smaller
systems
are
more
troublesome
-
for
any
given
degree
of
morphophonemic
complexity
.
This
hypothesis
will
account_for
a
large
part
of
the
difficulties
of
tonal
analysis
,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
vowel_systems
are
often
more
puzzling
than
consonantal_systems
.
The
statement
of
the
system
is
a
different
matter
.
Smaller
systems
can
of_course
be
stated
much
more
succinctly
.
A
phonemic_system
can
be
stated
without
reference_to
morphophonemics
,
but
it
cannot
always
be
found
without
morphophonemics
.
And
the
more
complex
the
morphophonemic_system
is
in_relation_to
the
phonemic
base
,
the
less
easily
a
phonemic_system
will
be
analysed
without
close
attention
to
the
morphophonemics
-
at_least
,
the
less
satisfying
will
a
phonemic
statement
be
if
it
cannot
be
related
through
morphophonemic
rules
to
grammatically
meaningful
structures
.
The
design
of
orthographies
has
received
much
less
attention
from
linguists
than
the
problem
deserves
.
There
has
been
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
many
American
linguists
to
assume
that
a
phonemic
transcription
will
automatically
be
the
best
possible
orthography
and
that
the
only
real
problem
will
then
be
the
social
one
of
securing
acceptance
.
This
seems
naive
.
Most
others
have
been
content
to
give
only
the
most
general
attention
to
the
broadest
and
most
obvious
features
of
the
phonology
when
designing
orthographies
.
Apparently
the
feeling
is
that
anything
more
would
be
involvement
in
technical
abstrusenesses
of
possible
pedantic
interest
but
of
no
visible
significance
in
practical
affairs
.
The
result
of
this
attitude
has
been
the
domination
of
many
orthography
conferences
by
such
considerations
as
typographic
'
esthetics
'
,
which
usually
turns_out
to
be
nothing
more
than
certain
prejudices
carried_over
from
European
languages
.
Many_of
the
suggested
systems
seem
to
have
only
the
most
tenuous
relationship
to
the
language
structures
that
they
purport
to
represent
.
Linguists
have
not
always
been
more
enlightened
than
``
practical
people
''
and
sometimes
have
insisted
on
incredibly
trivial
points
while
neglecting
things
of
much
greater
significance
.
As
a
result
,
many
people
have
been
confirmed
in
their
conviction
that
orthography
design
is
not
an
activity
to
which
experts
can
contribute
anything
but
confusion
.
A._E._Sharp
,
in
Vowel-Length_and_Syllabicity_in_Kikuyu
,
examines
one
set
of
related
orthographic
questions
and
its
phonologic
background
in_detail
.
His
objective
is
merely
to
determine
``
what
distinctions
of
length
and
syllabicity
it
may
be
desirable
to
make
explicit
in
a
Kikuyu
orthography
''
(
59
)
.
To
do
so
,
he
finds
it
necessary
to
examine
the
relevant
parts
of
the
phonology
thoroughly
and
in_detail
.
In
the
process
,
he
develops
some
very
significant
observations
about
problems
of
a
sort
that
are
often
difficult
.
A_few
of
his
examples
are
of
very
great
interest
,
and
the
whole
discussion
of
some
importance
for
theory
.
His
orthographic
recommendations
are
no
simplistic
acceptance
of
phonemics
on_the_one_hand
or
of
superficiality
on
the
other
.
Rather
he
weighs
each
phonologic
fact
in
the
light
of
its
orthographic
usefulness
.
He
concludes
that
some
changes
can
made
in
the
current
orthography
which
will
appreciably
improve
its
usefulness
,
but
hesitates
to
suggest
precise
graphic
devices
to
effect
these
changes
.
I
hope
his
suggestions
are
given
the
consideration
they
deserve
in
Kikuyu
circles
.
This
,
however
,
will
not
exhaust
their
practical
usefulness
,
as
they
rather
clearly
indicate
what
thorough
phonologic
investigation
can
contribute
to
orthography
design
.
We
need
many_more
studies
of
this
sort
if
the
design
of
written_languages
is
to
be
put
on
a
sound
basis
.
One
other
paper
deals
with
a
phonologic
problem
:
Vowel_Harmony_in_Igbo
,
by
J._Carnochan
.
This
restates
the
already
widely
known
facts
in_terms_of
prosodies
.
As
a
restatement
it
makes
only
a
small
contribution
to
knowledge
of
Igbo
.
But
it
would
seem
more
intended
as
a
tract
advocating
the
prosodic
theory
than
a
paper
directed
to
the
specific
problems
of
Igbo
phonology
.
The
paper
has
a
certain
value
as
a
comparatively
easy
introduction
to
this
approach
,
particularly
since
it
treats
a
fairly
simple
and
straightforward
phenomenon
where
it
is
possible
to
compare
it
with
a
more
traditional
(
though
not
structural
)
statement
.
It
does
show
one
feature
of
the
system
that
has
not
been
previously
described
.
But
it
does
not
,
as
it
claims
,
demonstrate
that
this
could
not
be
treated
by
traditional
methods
.
It
seems
to
me
that
it
rather
easily
can
.
Five
of
the
papers
deal
with
grammatical
problems
.
On_the_whole
they
maintain
much
the
same
high
standard
,
but
they
are
much
more
difficult
to
discuss
in_detail
because
of
their
wider
variety
of
subject_matter
.
My
comments
must
be
briefer
than
the
papers
deserve
.
W._H._Whiteley
writes_on
The_Verbal_Radical_in_Iraqw
.
This
must
be
considered
primarily
an
amendment
and
supplement
to
his
early
A_short_Description_of_Item-Categories_in_Iraqw
.
It
exhibits
much
the
same
descriptive
technique
and
is
open
to
much
the
same
criticisms
.
The
treatment
seems
unnecessarily
loose_jointed
and
complex
,
largely
because
the
method
is
lax
and
the
analysis
seems
never
to
be
pushed
to
a
satisfactory
or
even
a
consistent
stopping-point
.
