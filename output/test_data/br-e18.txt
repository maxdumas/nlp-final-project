The
old-time
bridges
over
the
Merrimac_River
in
Massachusetts
are
of
unusual
interest
in
many
respects
.
For
their
length
,
their
types
of
construction
,
their
picturesque
settings
,
and
their
literary
associations
,
they
should
be
known
and
remembered
.
In_this
sequence
I
shall
write_about
them
in
the
order
of
their
erection
.
The
first
bridge
known
to
have
been
covered
wholly
or
in_part
,
-
and
perhaps
the_most
interesting
one
,
connected
Newbury
(
now
Newburyport
)
with
Salisbury_Point
.
Its
building
was
first
proposed
in
1791
,
when
a
group
of
citizens
,
mostly
Newburyport
men
,
petitioned
the
General_Court
for
an
act
of
incorporation
.
This
document
began
:
''
Whereas
,
a
Bridge
over
Merrimack_River
,
from
the
Land
of
Hon

ble
Jonathan_Greenleaf
,
Esquire
,
in
Newbery
,
to
Deer_Island
,
and
from
said
Island
to
Salisbury
,
would
be
of
very
extensive
utility
,
by
affording
a
safe
Conveyance
to
Carriages
,
Teams
and
Travellers
at_all
seasons
of
the
year
,
and
at_all_Times
of

``
We
,
the
Subscribers
,
do
agree
,
that
as
soon
as
a
convenient
Number
of
Persons
have
subscribed
to
this
,
or
a
similar
Writing
,
We
will
present
a
petition
to
the
Hon
'
ble
General_Court
of
the
Commonwealth
of
Massachusetts
,
praying
for
an
Act
incorporating
into
a
Body_politic
the
subscribers
to
such
Writing
with
Liberty
to
build
such
a
Bridge
,
and
a
Right
to
demand
a
Toll
equal_to
that
received
at
Malden_Bridge
,
and
on
like
Terms
,
and
if
such
an
Act
shall
be
obtained
,
then
we
severally
agree
each
with
the
others
,
that
we
will
hold
in
the
said
Bridge
the
several
shares
set
against
our
respective
Names
,
the
whole
into
two
hundred
shares
being
divided
,
and
that
we
will
pay
such
sums_of_Money
at
such
Times
and
in
such
Manners
,
as
by
the
said
proposed
Corporation
,
shall
be
directed
and
required
''
.
This
paper
was
signed
by
forty-five
persons
,
subscribing
a
total
of
two
hundred
shares
.
A
month
later
the
General_Court
served
notice
to
the
town
of
Newbury
that
the
bridge
was
to
be_built
.
The_matter
was
considered
and
reconsidered
,
and
finally
opposed
,
but
in_spite_of
many
objections
,
the
Court
granted
a
charter
on
January
9
,
1792
.
On
November
26
of_that
year
the
bridge
was
completed
and
opened
.
Timothy_Palmer
,
who
invented
and
later
patented
the
arch
type
of
construction
for
wooden
bridges
,
was
the
genius
who
planned
and
supervised
the
building
of
the
Essex
,
or
``
Deer_Island
''
bridge
although
the
actual
work
was
carried_out
under
the
direction
of
William_Coombs
,
who
received
300
as
recompense
.
This
two-part
bridge
is
best
described
by
Rev._Timothy_Dwight
,
president
of
Yale_College
,
in
his
``
Travels
in
New-England
and
New-York
''
,
published
in
New_Haven
in
1821
.
He
says
of_it
:
``
It
consists_of
two
divisions
,
separated
by
an
island
at
a
small
distance
from
the
southern
shore
.
The
division
between
the
island
and
this
shore
,
consists
principally
of
an
arch
;
whose
chord
is
one_hundred
and
sixty
feet
,
and
whose
vortex
is
forty
feet
(
it
was
actually
37
feet
)
above
the
high-water_mark
.
In
appearance
and
construction
it
resembles
the
Pascataqua
bridge
.
The
whole
length
of
Essex
bridge
is
one_thousand
and
thirty
feet
and
its
breadth
thirty-four
.
I
have
already
mentioned
that
Mr._Timothy_Palmer
of
Newburyport
was
the
inventor
of
the
arched
bridges
in_this
country
.
As
Mr._Palmer
was
educated
to
house-building
only
,
and
had
never
seen
a
structure
of_this
nature
;
he
certainly
deserves
not
a_little
credit
for
the
invention
''
.
It
is
hardly
necessary
to
remind
students
of
covered
bridges
that
Timothy_Palmer
was_born
in
1751
in
nearby
Rowley
;
that
he
moved
with
his
parents
to
West_Boxford
when
he
was
sixteen
years
old
;
and
was_there
apprenticed
to
a
builder
and
architect
,
Moody_Spofford
.
It
was
indeed
a
remarkable
feat
that
a
man
who
had
had
no
experience
of
bridge
building
should
have
applied
the
principle
of
the
arch
,
which
appears
in
his
famous
bridges
at
Portsmouth
,
Haverhill
,
and
Philadelphia
.
The
Essex_Merrimack_Bridge
when
first
built
was
not
covered
.
As
far
as
we
know
,
no
American
bridge
had
been
thus
protected
in
1792
.
Richard_S._Allen
is
the
authority
for
the
statement
that
the
northern
section
was
probably
roofed
by
1810
.
Its
original
appearance
is_shown
in
an
engraving
published
in
the
``
Massachusetts_Magazine
''
in
May
1793
,
which
is
reproduced
herewith
(
Fig.
1
)
.
A
brief
description
accompanying
the
picture
says
that
the
bridge
contained
more_than
6000
tons
of
timber
.
Between
the
abutments
on
the
Newbury
shore
and
the
south
bank
of
Deer_Island
there
was
one
span
or
arch
measuring
160
feet
;
between
the
north
shore
of
Deer_Island
and
the
Salisbury
side
there
was
an
arch
of
113
feet
and
a
series
of
piers
with
a
draw
forty
feet
long
.
A
dinner
and
celebration
in
honor
of_this
piece
of
engineering
took_place
July
4
,
1793
,
in
a
tavern
erected
by
the
corporation
on
the
island
.
It
is
said
that
the
eccentric
Timothy_Dexter
,
who
was
one
of
the
first
share-holders
,
stood
on
the
table
and
made
a
speech
worthy
of
the
occasion
.
The
``
Essex_Journal
''
says
that
he
``
delivered
an
oration
on
the
bridge
,
which
for
elegance
of
style
,
propriety
of
speech
or
force
of
argument
,
was
truly
Ciceronian
''
.
The
reporter
must
have
written
this
with
tongue
in
cheek
,
because
Dexter
's
oration
could
hardly
be_understood
;
and
,
although
he
later
explained
that
he
was
talking
French
,
it
seems
rather
more
likely
that
he
had
succumbed
to
the
joys
of
the
evening
.
The
north
portion
of
the
Essex
bridge
was
well
worth
the
cost
of
construction
,
although
it
proved
to
be
twice
what
was
estimated
in_the_beginning
.
It
stood
in
its
original
form
until
1882
.
The
southern
half
,
however
,
on
account
of
its
underbracing
,
was
considered
by
boat
owners
a
menace
to
navigation
.
In
1810
it
was
torn_down
and
replaced
by
a
chain
suspension_bridge
.
This
was_built
by
John_Templeman
from
plans
submitted
by
James_Finley
of
Fayette_County
,
Pennsylvania
.
Timothy_Palmer
had
general
supervision
of
the
work
.
An
advertisement
in
the
``
Newburyport_Herald
''
,
December
21
,
1810
,
shows
Palmer
in
a
new
light
as
an
expert
on
chain
bridges
.
It
reads
:
''
Information
is
hereby
given
that
Mr._Timothy_Palmer
of
Newburyport
,
Mass.
has
agreed
to
take_charge
of
the
concerns
of
the
Patentees
of
the
Chain
Bridge
,
in
the
states
of
Massachusetts
,
New_Hampshire
,
Vermont
,
Rhode_Island
,
and
Connecticut
,
so_far
as
relates
to
the
sale
of
Patent_rights
and
the
construction
of
Chain
Bridges
.
``
Mr.
Palmer
will
attend_to
any
applications
relating
to
bridges
and
if
desired
will
view
the
proposed
site
,
and
lay_out
and
superintend
the
work
,
or
recommend
a
suitable
person
to
execute
it
.
John_Templeman
``
Approved
,
Timothy_Palmer
''
This
chain
bridge
proved
less
durable
than
the
wooden
arch
on
the
Salisbury
end
.
It
fell
,
February
6
,
1827
,
carrying
with_it
a
horse
and
wagon
,
two
men
and
four
oxen
.
The
horse
and
men
were
saved
,
but
the
oxen
drowned
.
In_spite_of
this
catastrophe
,
the
bridge
was
rebuilt
on
the
same
plan
and
opened
again
on
July
17
,
1827
.
This
second
chain
bridge
was
570
feet
long
,
had
two
thirty-foot
towers
and
a
draw
,
and
a
double
roadway
.
The
Essex
bridge
was
a
toll
crossing
until
1868
,
when
the
County
Commissioners
laid_out
all
the
Merrimack
bridges
as
highways
.
Sturdy
and
strong
after
more_than
a
century
of
continuous
use
,
the
old
covered
,
wooden
bridge
that
spans
the
Tygartis_Valley_River
at
Philippi
will
have
a
distinctive
part
in
the
week-long
observance
of
the
first
land
battle
of
the
Civil_War
at
its
home
site
,
May
28
th
to
June
3
rd
.
Colonel_Frederick_W._Lander
,
impersonated
,
will
again
make
his
break-neck
ride
down
the
steep
declivity
of
Talbott
's
(
now
College
)
Hill
and
thunder
across
the
bridge
to
join
Colonel_Benjamin_F._Kelley
's
(
West
)
Virginia_Infantry
,
then
swarming
through
the
streets
in
pursuit
of
the
retreating
Confederates
.
He
was
closely
followed
by
the
Ohio
and
Indiana
troops
-
thus
the
old
bridge
has
another
distinction
;
that
of
being
the
first
such
structure
secured
by
force
of
arms
in
the
war
of
the
'
60
s
.
The
bridge
has
survived
the
natural
hazards
of
the
elements
,
war
,
fire
,
and
floods
,
as_well
as
injuries
incident
to
heavy
traffic
,
for
more_than
a_hundred
years
.
Twice
during
the
Civil_War
it
was
saved
from
destruction
by
the
opposing
armies
by
the
pleas
and
prayers
of
a
local
minister
.
It
still
stands
as
a
monument
to
the
engineering
skills
of
the
last
century
and
still
serves
in
the
gasoline
age
to
carry
heavy
traffic
on
U._S._Route
250
-
the
old
Beverly
and
Fairmont_Turnpike
.
It
is
one
of
the
very_few
,
if_not
the
only
surviving
bridge
of
its
type
to
serve
a
main
artery
of
the
U._S.
highway_system
,
thus
it
is
far
more_than
a
relic
of
the
horse
and
buggy
days
.
This
covered
,
wooden
bridge
is
so
closely
identified
with
the
first
action
in
the
early
morning
of
June
3
,
1861
,
and
with
subsequent
troop
movements
of
both
armies
in
the
Philippi
area
that
it
has
become
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
war
story
.
So
frequently
has
pictures
of
the
bridge
appeared
in
books
and
in
national
publications
that
it
vies
with
the
old
John_Brown_Fort
at
Harpers_Ferry
as
the
two
nationally
best
known
structures
in
West_Virginia
.
Completed
and
opened
for
traffic
in
1852
,
the
bridge
was
designed
and
built
by
Lemuel_Chenoweth
and
his
brother
,
Eli
,
of
Beverly
.
The
Chenoweth
brothers
were
experienced
bridge
builders
,
and
against
the
competition
of
other
,
and
better
known
,
bridge
designers
and
builders
they
had
constructed
nine
of
the
covered
,
wooden
bridges
on
the
Parkersburg
and
Staunton_Turnpike
a
dozen
years
before
,
as_well
as_many
other
bridges
for
several
counties
.
The
Philippi
bridge
,
however
,
was
the
Chenoweth
master
piece
,
with
its
139
-
foot
,
dual
lane
,
span
-
and
it
stands
today
as
a
monument
to
its
builders
.
Never
rebuilt
,
the
bridge
was
strengthened
in
1938
by
two
extra
piers
,
a
concrete
floor
,
and
a
walk-way
along
the
upper_side
in_order_to
care
for
modern
traffic
.
During
the
war
it
was
in
constant
use
by
the
wagon_trains
transporting
supplies
from
the
railhead
at
Grafton
to
the
troops
operating
in
the
interior
.
Union
soldiers
at_times
used
it
for
sleeping
quarters
to
escape_from
the
rain
or
other
inclement
weather
,
and
some
of
them
left
momentoes
of
their
stay
by
carving
their
names
and
small
tokens
on
its
walls
and
beams
.
But
what
the
elements
could
not
do
was
seriously
threatened
when
Brigadier_General
William_E.
(
Grumble
)
Jones
reached
Philippi
while
on
the
famous
Jones-Imboden
raid
in
May
,
1863
.
General_Jones
was
fresh
from
a
long
series
of
bridge
burnings
,
including
the
long
bridge
at
Fairmont
,
and
,
after
seeing
a
great
drove
of
horses
and
cattle
he
had
collected
safely
across
the
bridge
,
he
sent
his
men
to
work
piling
combustibles
in
and
around
it
.
Reverend_Joshual_Corder
,
a
Baptist
minister
,
gathered
a_few
citizens
of
Southern
sympathies
,
to
call_on
Jones
and
plead
with
him
to
spare
the
structure
;
he
reasoned
and
argued
,
pointing_out
that
Jones
or
other
Confederate
commanders
would
need
it
should
troops
pass
that
way
in
retreat
.
Jones
relented
,
he
did
not
order
his
men
to
apply
the
torch
-
the
drove
of
livestock
was
driven
up
the
valley
,
via
Beverly
,
and
across
the
mountains
to
feed
and
serve
the
Confederate
army
,
while
Jones
and
his
raiders
turned
toward
Buckhannon
to
join
forces
with
Imboden
.
Again
Reverend_Corder
saved
the
bridge
when
Union
soldiers
planned
to
destroy
it
,
after
filling
its
two
lanes
with
hay
and
straw
-
but
for
what
reason
is
not
recorded
nor
remembered
,
certainly
not
because
of
pressure
from
an
opposing
Confederate
force
.
On
the
second
occasion
it
took
prayers
as_well
as
reason
to
dissuade
the
soldiers
from
their
purpose
.
Centering
around
this
historic
old
structure
,
a
group
of
public-spirited
Barbour_County
citizens
have
organized
and
planned
a
week-long
series
of
events
,
beginning
on
May
28
th
and
continuing
through
June
3
rd
,
to
observe
most
appropriately
the
centennial
of
the
first
land
engagement
of
the
Civil_War
at
Philippi
.
