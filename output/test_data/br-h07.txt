It
is
not
within
the
scope
of_this
report
elaborate
in
any
great
detail
upon
special
districts
in
Rhode_Island
.
However
,
a
word
should
be
mentioned
in
regard_to
them
as
independent
units
of
government
.
There
are
forty-seven
special
district
governments
in
Rhode_Island
(
excluding
two
regional
school
districts
,
four
housing
authorities
,
and
the
Kent_County_Water_Authority
)
.
These
forty-seven
special
purpose
governments
have
the
authority
to
levy
taxes
,
to
borrow
money
,
own
property
,
sue
and
be
sued
,
and
in_general
to
exercise
normal
corporate
powers
.
Unlike
cities
and
towns
,
however
,
they
do
not
have
to
submit
any
financial_statements
to
the
state
Bureau
of
Audits
.
It
is
not
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
state_government
has
little
or
no
fiscal
control
over
these
units
of
government
.
In_addition
to
the
collection
of
service_charges
,
the
special
districts
levy
annual
property_taxes
of
approximately
$
450000
.
A
review
of
practices
in
other
states
regarding
fiscal
uniformity
is
pertinent
to
this
report
.
Included
in
the
findings
are
:
Forty-six
states
,
including
Rhode_Island
,
end
their
fiscal_year
on
June
30
.
The
other
four
states
end
on
varying
dates
:
Alabama
(
Sept.
30
)
,
New_York
(
March
31
)
,
Pennsylvania
(
May
31
)
,
and
Texas
(
August
31
)
.
In
sixteen
states
,
the
fiscal_year
ending
of
the
cities
(
June
30
)
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
state
:
Alaska
,
Arizona
,
California
,
Delaware
,
Massachusetts
,
Montana
,
Nevada
,
New_Mexico
,
North_Carolina
,
North_Dakota
,
Oklahoma
,
Oregon
,
Vermont
,
West_Virginia
,
Wyoming
,
and
Hawaii
)
.
In
eleven
states
,
the
fiscal_year
of
the
cities
ends
on
December
31
,
while
the
state
fiscal_year
ends
on
June
30
(
Arkansas
,
Colorado
,
Indiana
,
Kansas
,
New_Hampshire
,
New_Jersey
,
Ohio
,
South_Dakota
,
Utah
,
Washington
,
and
Wisconsin
)
.
In
eight
states
whose
fiscal_years
close
on
June
30
,
a
majority
of
their
cities
close
their
fiscal_year
on
December
31
:
(
Georgia
,
Iowa
,
Kentucky
,
Maine
,
Maryland
,
Minnesota
,
Virginia
,
and
South_Carolina
)
.
One
state
,
Alabama
,
closes
its
fiscal_year
on
September
30
,
and
all
cities
in
the
state
,
with
one
exception
,
also
close
fiscal_years
on
September
30
.
Mississippi
closes
its
fiscal_year
on
June
30
,
while
all_of
its
cities
close
their
fiscal_years
on
September
30
.
Pennsylvania
closes
its
fiscal_year
on
May
31
.
All_of
its
cities
close
their
fiscal_years
on
December
31
.
The
remaining
twelve
states
have
varying
fiscal_years
for
the
state
,
city
and
local_governments
.
However
,
only
Illinois
,
Oregon
,
Louisiana
and
Rhode_Island
have
a
situation
in_which
the
sundry
units
of
government
vary
widely
in_relation_to
fiscal
uniformity
.
An
excellent
summary
of
advantages
concerning
the
uniform
fiscal_year
and
coordinated
fiscal
calendars
was
contained
in
a
paper
presented
by
a
public
finance
authority
recently
.
He
listed
among
the
values
of
fiscal
uniformity
:
The
uniform
fiscal_year
requires
compliance
with
common_sense
administration
of
local
finances
:
adoption
of
the
budget
,
or
financial
plan
,
in_advance
of
spending
.
The
uniform
fiscal_year
ensures
conformance
with
another
common_sense
rule
,
that
of
having
cash
in
the
bank
before
checks
are
drawn
.
It
enables
towns
to
make
more
economical
purchases
and
to
take_advantage
of
cash
discounts
.
The
uniform
fiscal_year
promotes
more
careful
budgeting
and
strengthens
control
over
expenditures
.
By
fixing
the
tax_rate
in_advance
of
spending
,
upper_limits
are
set
on
expenditures
.
The
uniform
fiscal_year
brings
the
town
's
fiscal_year
into
line
with_that
of
the
schools
,
which
expend
the
largest
share
of
local
disbursements
.
This
greatly
simplifies
the
town
's
bookkeeping
and
financial
reporting
.
The
uniform
fiscal_year
eliminates
interest
charges
on
money
borrowed
in
the
form
of
tax
anticipation
notes
.
Furthermore
,
tax_collections
not
immediately
needed
for
current
expenditures
may
be
invested
in
short-term
treasury_notes
,
augmenting
the
town
's
miscellaneous
revenues
and
reducing
the
tax
levy
.
The
uniform
fiscal_year
facilitates
inter-town
comparison
of
revenues
and
expenditures
.
When
towns
have
the
same
fiscal_year
it
is
relatively
easy
to
make
meaningful
comparisons
;
and
as
the
cost
of
local_government
increases
,
the
demand
for
such
comparison
also
increases
.
Towns
having
different
fiscal_years
are
difficult
to
compare
.
Of
all
advantages
,
probably
none
is
more
important
than
the
elimination
of
tax
anticipation
notes
.
Borrowing
in
anticipation
of
current
taxes
and
other
revenues
is
a
routine
procedure
of
the
majority
of
municipalities
at_all_times
.
It
may
be
by
bank
loans
,
sale
of
notes
or
warrants
,
or
by
the
somewhat
casual
method
of
issuance
and
registration
of
warrants
.
In_any_event
it
is
a
form
of
borrowing
which
could
be
and
should
be
rendered
unnecessary
.
Its
elimination
would
result
in
the
saving
of
interest
costs
,
heavy
when
short-term
money
rates
are
high
,
and
in
freedom
from
dependence
on
credit
which
is
not
always
available
when
needed
most
.
This
type
of
borrowing
can
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
if
quarterly
installment
payment
of
taxes
is
instituted
and
the
first
payment
placed
near
the
opening
of
the
fiscal_year
.
Any
approach
toward
such
a
system
looks
toward
saving
and
security
.
It
should
be
noted
that
there
are
other
and
equally
important
reasons
for
establishing
meaningful
intergovernmental
reporting
bases
on
a
uniform
fiscal_year
.
Both
the
federal
and
state_governments
commence
their
fiscal_years
on
July_1
.
Both
units
of
government
contribute
increasingly
large
sums_of_money
to
the
several
local_governments
in_this
state
as
indicated
below
:
It
has
been
said
that
when
local_government
revenues
were
mostly
produced
locally
from
the
property_tax
,
the
lack
of
a
uniform
fiscal_year
was
no
great
handicap
;
but
with
the
growth
of
state
and
federal
fiscal
aid
,
the
emphasis
on
equalization
,
and
the
state-local
sharing
of
responsibility
for_certain
important
functions
,
this
is
no_longer
true
.
The
haphazard
fiscal_year
calendar
is
an
obstacle
to
the
planning
of
clear
and
efficient
state-local
revenue
and
expenditure
relationships
.
Although
there
are
many
sound
reasons
for
adopting
uniform
and
coordinated
fiscal_years
in
Rhode_Island
,
there
are
also
certain
difficulties
encountered
.
These
involve
more
the
mechanics
employed
in
adjusting
to
fiscal
uniformity
than
they
do
actual
actual
disadvantages
to
the
principle
.
One
problem
is
a
matter
of
shifting
dates
;
the
other
,
is
how
to
finance
the
transition
.
Little
can
be
done
about
the
changing
of
dates
.
This
is
an
inherent
part
of
adjusting
fiscal
calendars
.
It
usually
means
a
confused
and
disgruntled
tax-paying
public
for
a
period_of_time
.
But
cooperation
and
understanding
between
local
officials
and
the
citizenry
help
lessen
this
problem
.
The
other
problem
is
the_matter
of
financing
the
transition
period
in
the
several
cities
and
towns
.
This
will
be
covered
more
fully
later
.
It
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
ease
or
difficulty
with
which
a
town
or
city
can
convert
to
the
proposed
plan
is
directly
dependent
upon
the
financial_condition
of_that
town
or
city
.
Fortunately
,
there
are
no
cities
or
towns
in
the
state
,
with
one
or
two
possible
exceptions
that
are
in
too
difficult
a
position
to
finance
the
proposed
change
.
Sacrifice
will
have
to
be
made
in
some
cases
,
but
it
is
to
the
municipality
's
advantage
to
finance
the
change-over
for
a
short
period_of_time
rather_than
pay
interest
on
tax
anticipation
notes
indefinitely
.
The
advantages
of
a
uniform
fiscal_year
and
well
synchronized
fiscal
and
tax_collection
calendars
are
sufficiently
great
for
Rhode_Island
municipalities
to
exert
effort
to
secure
them
.
The
type
of
program
desired
can
be
determined
by
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
adjustments
needed
.
Two
features
are
immediately
evident
.
First
,
the
present
situation
is
too
varied
to
be
systematized
by
any
single
formula
.
Second
,
the
shift
to
a
uniform
July_1
-
June
30
fiscal_year
will
,
of
itself
,
improve
the
tax_collection
calendars
of
the
great
majority
of
cities
and
towns
.
There
are
at_least
two
problems
to
consider
:
one
is
a
matter
of
adjusting
the
fiscal
calendar
;
the
other
is
how
to
finance
the
adjustments
when
necessary
.
The
latter
matter
is
considered
in_detail
in
a
later
section
.
Twelve
cities
and
towns
in
Rhode_Island
presently
indicate
some
plans
to
establish
a
uniform
and
/
or
coordinated
fiscal-tax
year
calendar
.
Plans
vary
from
the
``
talking
stage
''
to
establishing
special
committees
to
accomplish
this
end
.
What
is
important
here
is
that
many_of
the
cities
and
towns
recognize
the
need
for
improved
fiscal
practices
and
are
taking
the
initiative
to
obtain
them
.
An
analysis
of
the
fiscal-tax
collection
year
calendars
throughout
the
state
indicates
that
transition
may
not
be
as
painful
as
is
commonly
thought
.
However
,
it
must
be
stressed
that_much
depends_upon
the
financial_condition
of
the
individual
cities
and
towns
involved
.
The
adjustments
needed
to
establish
a
uniform
and
coordinated
fiscal-tax
collection
year
calendar
throughout
Rhode_Island
,
based
on
a
July_1
-
June
30
year
,
are
shown
below
.
Six
cities
and
towns
are
presently
on
a
July_1
-
June
30
fiscal_year
and
have
coordinated
their
tax_collection
year
with_it
.
No
change
is
required
for
these
towns
.
These
municipalities
include
:
Barrington
,
Lincoln
,
Middletown
,
Newport
,
North_Kingstown
,
and
South_Kingstown
.
One
town
and
one
city
,
Coventry
and
East_Providence
,
require
an
adjustment
of
their
fiscal_year
only
.
This
change
will
automatically
adjust
their
tax_collection
year
calendar
so_as_to
make
all
tax
installments
due
and
payable
in
the
fiscal_year
collectible
within
that
year
.
Six
cities
and
towns
are
now
on
a
July_1
-
June
30
fiscal_year
and
will
need
only
to
adjust
their
tax_collection
year
calendar
to
establish
uniformity
.
These
cities
and
towns
include
Bristol
,
Glocester
,
Pawtucket
,
Cumberland
,
Central_Falls
,
and
Woonsocket
.
Two
cities
to
be
considered
,
Providence
and
Cranston
,
are
an
enigma
.
Both
have
excellent
integration
of
their
fiscal-tax
collection
year
calendars
.
However
,
neither
of
these
two
cities
is
on
the
desired
July_1
-
June
30
fiscal_year
.
The
adjustment
to
a
uniform
and
coordinated
fiscal
period
could
be
accomplished
relatively
easy
for
them
.
In_that
both
cities
end
their
fiscal_years
on
September
30
,
they
could
levy
taxes
for
an
interim
period
of
nine
months
,
commencing
with
September
30
and
ending
with
June
30
.
These
three
installment
dates
would
be
:
October
26
,
January
26
,
and
April
25
(
Providence
)
and
November
15
,
February
16
and
May
15
(
Cranston
)
.
Both
would
start
their
new
fiscal_year
on
July_1
.
Their
tax_collection
calendar
could
then
be
:
July
25
,
October
26
,
January
26
,
and
April
25
,
(
Providence
)
;
and
August
15
,
November
15
,
February
17
,
and
May
15
,
(
Cranston
)
.
Under
this
plan
both
Cranston
and
Providence
would
be
on
the
uniform
fiscal_year
but
would
still
be
using
the
same
installment
periods
.
The
remaining
twenty-three
towns
have
fiscal_years
which
end
prior
to
June
30
.
All_of
these
towns
will
require
adjustments
of
both
their
fiscal
and
tax_collection
years
.
Assuming
an
adjustment
to
the
July_1
-
June
30
fiscal_year
,
the
required
adjustment
of
the
tax_collection
years
and
the
towns
involved
are
shown
in
Table
3
.
Aside
from
the_matter
of
adjusting
the
fiscal
and
tax
calendars
,
there
is
the
problem
of
financing
the
adjustment
when
this
is
necessary
.
It
should
be
emphasized
strongly
that
adjustments
in
fiscal
dates
or
adoption
of
interim
budgets
do
not
necessarily
mean
financing
over
and
above
normal
governmental
requirements
.
In
many
communities
there
is
simply
no
financial
problem
;
it
is
only
a
matter
of
adjusting
accounting
methods
,
careful
fiscal
planning
and
management
,
or
some
like
combination
of
techniques
.
In
other
municipalities
the
difficulties
in
overcoming
the
financial
burden
have
been
sufficiently
great
to
dishearten
proponents
of
fiscal_year
changes
.
Fortunately
,
such
cases
in
Rhode_Island
are
more
the
exception
than
the
rule
.
As
shown
earlier
in
Table
1
,
the
several
cities
and
towns
use
widely
varied
fiscal
and
tax_collection
calendars
.
In_addition
,
no
two
Rhode_Island
communities
are
identical
in_relation_to
their
over-all
financial_condition
.
These
factors
practically
insure
that
no
single
financing
formula
is
feasible
;
each
situation
must
be
studied
and
a
plan
developed
that
takes
into
consideration
such
factors
as
the
effect
of
the
existing
and
prospective
tax
calendars
,
the
financial_condition
of
the
treasuries
,
and
the
length
of
the
transition
interval
.
Suitable
plans
range
from
those
that
are
very
easy
to
develop
to
those
that
are
difficult
to
formulate
and
require
borrowing
ranging
from
short-term
serial
notes
to
long-term
bonds
.
The
financial
problem
,
where
it
exists
,
usually
stems
from
the
adoption
of
a
budget
for
the
transitional
or
adjustment
period
.
For
those
communities
which
have
financial
difficulties
in
effecting
adjustments
,
there
are
a_number_of
alternatives
any
one
of_which
alone
,
or
in
combination
with
others
,
would
minimize
if_not
even
eliminate
the
problem
.
