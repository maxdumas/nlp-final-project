In_the_past
,
the
duties
of
the
state
,
as
Sir_Henry_Maine
noted
long_ago
,
were
only
two
in
number
:
internal
order
and
external
security
.
By
prevailing
over
other
claimants
for
the
loyalties
of
men
,
the
nation-state
maintained
an
adequate
measure
of
certainty
and
order
within
its
territorial
borders
.
Outside
those
limits
it
asserted
,
as
against
other
states
,
a
position
of
sovereign
equality
,
and
,
as
against
the
``
inferior
''
peoples
of
the
non-Western
world
,
a
position
of
dominance
.
It
became
the
sole
``
subject
''
of
``
international_law
''
(
a
term
which
,
it
is
pertinent
to
remember
,
was
coined
by
Bentham
)
,
a
body
of
legal_principle
which
by_and_large
was
made_up
of
what
Western
nations
could
do
in
the
world
arena
.
(
That
corpus
of
law
was
a
reflection
of
the
power_system
in
existence
during
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
.
Speaking
generally
,
it
furthered
-
and
still
tends
to
further
-
the
interests
of
the
Western
powers
.
The
enormous
changes
in
world
politics
have
,
however
,
thrown
it
into
confusion
,
so_much
so_that
it
is
safe
to
say
that
all
international_law
is
now
in
need
of
reexamination
and
clarification
in
light
of
the
social
conditions
of
the
present
era
.
)
Beyond
the
two
basic
tasks
mentioned
above
,
no
attention
was
paid
by
statesman
or
scholar
to
an
idea
of
state
responsibility
,
either
internally
or
externally
.
This
was
particularly
true
in
the
world
arena
,
which
was
an
anarchical
battleground
characterized
by
strife
and
avaricious
competition
for
colonial
empires
.
That
any
sort_of
duty
was
owed
by
his
nation
to
other
nations
would
have
astonished
a
nineteenth-century
statesman
.
His
duty
was
to
his
sovereign
and
to
his
nation
,
and
an
extension
to
peoples
beyond
the
territorial
boundaries
was
not
to
be
contemplated
.
Thus
,
to
cite
but
one
example
,
the
Pax_Britannica
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
whether
with
the_British
navy
ruling
the
seas
or
with
the
City
of
London
ruling
world
finance
,
was
strictly
national
in
motivation
,
however
much
other
nations
(
e._g.
,
the
United_States
)
may
have
incidentally
benefited
.
At_the_same_time
,
all
suggestions
that
some
sort_of
societal
responsibility
existed
for
the
welfare
of
the
people
within
the
territorial
state
was
strongly
resisted
.
Social_Darwinism
was
able
to
stave_off
the
incipient
socialist
movement
until
well
into
the
present
century
.
However
,
in
recent
decades
,
for
what
doubtless
are
multiple
reasons
,
an
unannounced
but
nonetheless
readily
observable
shift
has
occurred
in
both
facets
of
national
activity
.
A
concept
of
responsibility
is
in
process
of
articulation
and
establishment
.
Already
firmly
implanted
internally
,
it
is
a
growing
factor
in
external
matters
.
A_little
more_than
twenty
years
ago
the
American
people
turned
an
important
corner
.
In_what
has
aptly
been
called
a
``
constitutional
revolution
''
,
the
basic
nature
of
government
was
transformed
from
one
essentially
negative
in
nature
(
the
``
night-watchman
state
''
)
to
one
with
affirmative
duties
to
perform
.
The
``
positive
state
''
came
into
existence
.
For
lawyers
,
reflecting
perhaps
their
parochial
preferences
,
there
has
been
a
special
fascination
since
then
in
the
role
played
by
the
Supreme_Court
in_that
transformation
-
the
manner
in_which
its
decisions
altered
in
``
the
switch
in_time
that
saved
nine
''
,
President_Roosevelt
's
ill-starred
but
in_effect
victorious
``
Court-packing
plan
''
,
the
imprimatur
of
judicial
approval
that
was
finally
placed
upon
social
legislation
.
Of
greater
importance
,
however
,
is
the
content
of
those
programs
,
which
have
had
and
are
having
enormous
consequences
for
the
American
people
.
Labor
relations
have
been
transformed
,
income
security
has
become
a
standardized
feature
of
political_platforms
,
and
all
the
many
facets
of
the
American
version
of
the
welfare_state
have
become
part
of
the
conventional
wisdom
.
A
national
consensus
of
near
unanimity
exists
that
these
governmental
efforts
are
desirable
as_well
as
necessary
.
Ratified
in
the
Republican_Party
victory
in
1952
,
the
Positive
State
is
now
evidenced
by
political_campaigns
being
waged
not
on
whether
but
on
how
much
social
legislation
there
should
be
.
The
general
acceptance
of
the
idea
of
governmental
(
i.
e.
,
societal
)
responsibility
for
the
economic
well-being
of
the
American
people
is
surely
one
of
the
two
most
significant
watersheds
in
American
constitutional
history
.
The
other
,
of_course
,
was
the
Civil_War
,
the
conflict
which
a
century
ago
insured
national
unity
over
fragmentation
.
A
third
,
one
of
at_least
equal
and
perhaps
even
greater
importance
,
is
now
being
traversed
:
American
immersion
and
involvement
in
world
affairs
.
Internal
national
responsibility
,
now
a
truism
,
need
not
be
documented
.
Nevertheless
,
it
may
be
helpful
to
cite
one
example
-
that
of
employment
-
for
,
as
will
be
shown
below
,
it
cuts_across
both
facets
of
the
new
concept
.
Thirty
years
ago
,
while
the
nation
was
wallowing
in
economic
depression
,
the
prevailing
philosophy
of
government
was
to
stand
aside
and
allow
``
natural
forces
''
to
operate
and
cure
the
distress
.
That
guiding
principle
of
the
Hoover_Administration
fell
to
the
siege
guns
of
the
New_Deal
;
less_than
a
score
of
years
later
Congress
enacted
the
Employment_Act
of
1946
,
by
which
the
national
government
assumed
the
responsibility
of
taking
action
to
insure
conditions
of
maximum
employment
.
Hands-off
the
economy
was
replaced
by
conscious
guidance
through
planning
-
the
economic
side
of
the
constitutional
revolution
.
In
1961
the
first
important
legislative
victory
of
the
Kennedy_Administration
came
when
the
principle
of
national
responsibility
for
local
economic
distress
won
out
over
a
``
state
's
-
responsibility
''
proposal
-
provision
was
made
for
payment
for
unemployment
relief
by
nation-wide
taxation
rather_than
by
a
levy
only
on
those
states
afflicted
with
manpower
surplus
.
The
American
people
have
indeed
come
a
long
way
in
the
brief
interval
between
1930
and
1961
.
Internal
national
responsibility
is
a
societal
response
to
the
impact
of
the
Industrial_Revolution
.
Reduced
to
its
simplest
terms
,
it
is
an
assumption
of
a
collective
duty
to
compensate
IN
the
inability
of
individuals
to
cope_with
the
rigors
of
the
era
.
National
responsibility
for
individual
welfare
is
a
concept
not
limited
to
the
United_States
or
even
to
the
Western
nations
.
A
measure
of
its
widespread
acceptance
may
be
derived
from
a
statement
of
the
International_Congress
of
Jurists
in
1959
.
Meeting
in
New_Delhi
under
the
auspices
of
the
International_Commission
of
Jurists
,
a
body
of
lawyers
from
the
free_world
,
the
Congress
redefined
and
expanded
the
traditional
Rule_of_Law
to
include
affirmative
governmental
duties
.
It
is
noteworthy
that
the
majority
of
the
delegates
to
the
Congress
were
from
the
less
developed
,
former
colonial
nations
.
The
Rule_of_Law
,
historically
a
principle
according
everyone
his
``
day
in
court
''
before
an
impartial
tribunal
,
was
broadened
substantively
by
making
it
a
responsibility
of
government
to
promote
individual
welfare
.
Recognizing
that
the
Rule_of_Law
is
``
a
dynamic
concept
which
should
be
employed
not_only
to
safeguard
the
civil
and
political
rights
of
the
individual
in
a
free
society
''
,
the
Congress
asserted
that
it
also
included
the
responsibility
``
to
establish
social
,
economic
,
educational
and
cultural
conditions
under
which
his
legitimate
aspirations
and
dignity
may
be
realized
''
.
The
idea
of
national
responsibility
thus
has
become
a
common
feature
of
the
nations
of
the
non-Soviet
world
.
For
better
or
for
worse
,
we
all
now
live
in
welfare_states
,
the
organizing
principle
of_which
is
collective
responsibility
for
individual
well-being
.
Whether
a
concept
analogous
to
the
principle
of
internal
responsibility
operates
in
a
nation
's
external
relations
is
less
obvious
and
more
difficult
to
establish
.
The
hypothesis
ventured
here
is
that
it
does
,
and
that
evidence
is
accumulating
validating
that
proposition
.
The
content
is
not
the
same
,
however
:
rather_than
individual
security
,
it
is
the
security
and
continuing
existence
of
an
``
ideological
group
''
-
those
in
the
``
free_world
''
-
that
is
basic
.
External
national
responsibility
involves
a
burgeoning
requirement
that
the
leaders
of
the
Western
nations
so
guide
their
decisions
as
to
further
the
viability
of
other
friendly
nations
.
If
internal
responsibility
suggests
acceptance
of
the
socialist
ideal
of
equality
,
then
external
responsibility
implies
adherence
to
principles
of
ideological
supranationalism
.
Reference_to
two
other
concepts
-
nationalism
and
sovereignty
-
may
help
to
reveal
the
contours
of
the
new
principle
.
In
its
beginnings
the
nation-state
had
to
struggle
to
assert
itself
-
internally
,
against
feudal
groups
,
and
externally
,
against
the
power
and
influence
of
such
other
claimants
for
loyalty
as
the
Church
.
The
breakup
of
the
Holy_Roman_Empire
and
the
downfall
of
feudalism
led
,
not
more_than
two
centuries
ago
,
to
the
surge
of
nationalism
.
(
Since
the
time-span
of
the
nation-state
coincides
roughly
with
the
separate
existence
of
the
United_States
as
an
independent
entity
,
it
is
perhaps
natural
for
Americans
to
think_of
the
nation
as
representative
of
the
highest
form
of
order
,
something
permanent
and
unchanging
.
)
The
concept
of
nationalism
is
the
political
principle
that
epitomizes
and
glorifies
the
territorial
state
as
the
characteristic
type
of
socal
structure
.
But
it
is
more_than
that
.
For
it
includes
the
emotional
ties
that
bind
men
to
their
homeland
and
the
complex
motivations
that
hold
a
large
group
of
people
together
as
a
unit
.
Today
,
as
new
nations
rise
from
the
former
colonial
empires
,
nationalism
is
one
of
the
hurricane
forces
loose
in
the
world
.
Almost
febrile
in
intensity
,
the
principle
has
become
worldwide
in
application
-
unfortunately
at
the
very
time
that
nationalist
fervors
can
wreak
greatest
harm
.
Historically
,
however
,
the
concept
is
one
that
has
been
of
marked
benefit
to
the
people
of
the
Western
civilizational
group
.
By
subduing
disparate
lesser
groups
the
nation
has
,
to_some_degree
at_least
,
broadened
the
capacity
for
individual
liberty
.
Within
their
confines
,
moreover
,
technological
and
industrial
growth
has
proceeded
at
an
accelerated
pace
,
thus
increasing
the
cornucopia
from
which
material
wants
can
be
satisfied
.
While
the
pattern
is
uneven
,
some
having
gained
more_than
others
,
nationalism
has
in_fact
served
the
Western
peoples
well
.
(
Whether
historical
nationalism
helped
the
peoples
of
the
remainder
of
the
world
,
and
whether
today
's
nationalism
in
the
former
colonial
areas
has
equally
beneficial
aspects
,
are
other
questions
.
)
It
is
one
of
the
ironic
quirks
of
history
that
the
viability
and
usefulness
of
nationalism
and
the
territorial
state
are
rapidly
dissipating
at
precisely
the
time
that
the
nation-state
attained
its
highest
number
(
approximately
100
)
.
But
it
is
more_than
irony
:
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
nationalism
is
no_longer
a
tenable
concept
is
because
it
has
spread
throughout
the
planet
.
In_other_words
,
nationalism
worked
well
enough
when
it
had
limited
application
,
both
as
to
geography
and
as
to
population
;
it
becomes
a
perilous
anachronism
when
adopted
on
a
world-wide
basis
.
Complementing
the
political
principle
of
nationalism
is
the
legal_principle
of
sovereignty
.
The
former
receives
its
legitimacy
from
the
latter
.
Operating
side_by_side
,
together
they
helped
shore_up
the
nation-state
.
While
sovereignty
has
roots
in
antiquity
,
in
its
present
usage
it
is
essentially
modern
.
Jean_Bodin
,
writing
in
the
sixteenth
century
,
may
have
been
the
seminal
thinker
,
but
it
was
the
vastly
influential
John_Austin
who
set_out
the
main_lines
of
the
concept
as
now
understood
.
Austin
's
nineteenth-century
view
of
law
and
sovereignty
still
dominates
much
of
today
's
legal
and
political
thinking
.
To
him
,
law
is
the
command
of
the
sovereign
(
the_English
monarch
)
who
personifies
the
power
of
the
nation
,
while
sovereignty
is
the
power
to
make
law
-
i.
e.
,
to
prevail
over
internal
groups
and
to
be
free
from
the
commands
of
other
sovereigns
in
other
nations
.
These
fundamental
ideas
-
the
indivisibility
of
sovereignty
and
its
dual
(
internal-external
)
aspects
-
still
remain
the
core
of_that
concept
of
ultimate
political
power
.
The
nation-state
,
then
,
exemplifies
the
principle
of
nationalism
and
exercises
sovereignty
:
supreme
power
over
domestic
affairs
and
independence
from
outside
control
.
In_fact
,
however
,
both
principles
have
always
been
nebulous
and
loosely
defined
.
High-level
abstractions
are
always
difficult
to
pin_down
with
precision
.
That
is
particularly
true
of
sovereignty
when
it
is
applied
to
democratic
societies
,
in_which
``
popular
''
sovereignty
is
said
to
exist
,
and
in
federal
nations
,
in_which
the
jobs
of
government
are
split
.
Nevertheless
,
nationalism
and
sovereignty
are
reputed
,
in
the
accepted
wisdom
,
to
describe
the
modern_world
.
Is_there
a
different
reality
behind
the
facade
?
Does
the
surface
hide
a
quite
different
picture
?
The
short
answer
to
those
questions
is
``
yes
''
.
Both
concepts
are
undergoing
alteration
;
to_some_degree
they
are
being
supplanted
by
a
concept
of
national
responsibility
.
As
evidence
to
support
that
view
,
consider
the
following
illustrative
instances
.
