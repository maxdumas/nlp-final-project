I
have
,
within
the
past
fifty
years
,
come_out
of
all
uncertainty
into
a
faith
which
is
a
dominating
conviction
of
the
Truth
and
about
which
I
have
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
.
It
has
been
my
lot
all
through
life
to
associate
with
eminent
scientists
and
at_times
to
discuss
with
them
the
deepest
and
most
vital
of
all
questions
,
the
nature
of
the
hope
of
a
life
beyond
this
.
I
have
also
constantly
engaged
in
scientific
work
and
am
fully
aware_of
the
value
of
opinions
formed
in
science
as_well
as
in
the
religions
in
the
world
.
n
an
amateu6rish
,
yet
in
a
very
real
sense
,
I
have
followed
the
developments
of
archaeology
,
geology
,
astronomy
,
herpetology
,
and
mycology
with
a
hearty
appreciation
of
the
advances
being
made
in
these
fields
.
At_one_time
I
became
disturbed
in
the
faith
in_which
I
had
grown_up
by
the
apparent
inroads
being
made
upon
both
Old
and
New_Testaments
by
a
``
Higher_Criticism
''
of
the
Bible
,
to
refute
which
I
felt
the
need
of
a
better
knowledge
of
Hebrew
and
of
archaeology
,
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
to
pull_out
some
of
the
props
of
our
faith
was
to
weaken
the
entire
structure
.
Doubts
thus
inculcated
left
me
floundering
for_a_while
and
,
like
some
higher
critical
friends
,
trying
to
continue
to
use
the
Bible
as
the
Word_of_God
while
at_the_same_time
holding
it
to
have
been
subjected
to
a
vast
number
of
redactions
and
interpolations
:
attempting
to
bridge
the
chasm
between
an
older
,
reverent
,
Bible-loving
generation
and
a
critical
,
doubting
,
Bible-emancipated
race
.
Although
still
aware_of
a
great
light
and
glow
of
warmth
in
the
Book
,
I
stood
outside
shivering
in
the
cold
.
In
one
thing
the
higher
critics
,
like
the
modernists
,
however
,
overreached
themselves
,
in
claiming
that
the
Gospel
of
John
was
not
written
in
John
's
time
but
well
after
the
first
century
,
perhaps
as
late
as
150
A._D.
.
Now
,
if
any
part
of
the
Bible
is
assuredly
the
very
Word_of_God
speaking
through
His
servant
,
it
is
John
's
Gospel
.
To
ask
me
to
believe
that
so
inexpressibly
marvelous
a
book
was
written
long
after_all
the
events
by
some
admiring
follower
,
and
was
not
inspired
directly
by
the
Spirit
of
God
,
is
asking
me
to
accept
a
miracle
far
greater
than
any
of
those
recorded
in
the
Bible
.
Here
I
took
my
leave
of
my
learned
friends
to
step
out
on
another
path
,
to_which
we
might
give
the
modern
name
of
Pragmatism
,
or
the
thing
that
works
.
Test
it
,
try
it
,
and
if
it
works
,
accept
it
as
a
guiding
principle
.
So
,
I
put
my
Bible
to
the
practical
test
of
noting
what
it
says
about
itself
,
and_then
tested
it
to
see
how
it
worked
.
As
a
short
,
possibly
not
the
best
method
,
I
looked_up
``
Word
''
in
the
Concordance
and
noted
that
the
Bible
claims
from
Genesis
1
to
Revelation
22
to
be
God
's
personal
message
to
man
.
The
next
traditional
step
then
was
to
accept
it
as
the
authoritative
textbook
of
the
Christian
faith
just_as
one
would
accept
a
treatise
on
any
earthly
``
science
''
,
and
I
submitted
to
its
conditions
according
to
Christ
's
invitation
and
promise
that
,
``
If
any
man
will
do
his
will
,
he
shall
know
of
the
doctrine
,
whether
it
be
of
God
,
or
whether
I
speak
of
myself
''
(
John
7
:
17
)
.
The
outcome
of
such
an
experiment
has
been
in_due_time
the
acceptance
of
the
Bible
as
the
Word_of_God
inspired
in_a_sense
utterly
different
from
any
merely
human
book
,
and
with_it
the
acceptance
of
our
Lord
Jesus_Christ
as
the
only
begotten
Son
of
God
,
Son
of
Man
by
the_Virgin
Mary
,
the
Saviour
of
the
world
.
I
believe
,
therefore
,
that
we
are
without
exception
sinners
,
by
nature
alienated
from
God
,
and
that
Jesus_Christ
,
the
Son
of
God
,
came
to
earth
,
the
representative
Head
of
a
new
race
,
to
die
upon
the
cross
and
pay
the
penalty
of
the
sin
of
the
world
,
and
that
he
who
thus
receives
Christ
as
his
personal
Saviour
is
``
born
again
''
spiritually
,
with
new
privileges
,
appetites
,
and
affections
,
destined
to
live
and
grow
in
His
likeness
forever
.
Nor
can
any
man
save
himself
by
good
works
or
by
a
commendable
``
moral
life
''
,
although
such
works
are
the
natural
fruits
and
evidences
of
a
saving
faith
already
received
and
naturally
expressing
itself
through
such
avenues
.
I
now
ever
look_for
Christ
acording
to
His
promises
and
those
of
the
Old_Testament
as_well
,
to
appear
again
in
glory
to
put_away
all
sin
and
to
reign
in
righteousness
over
the
whole
earth
.
To
state
fully
what
the
Bible
means
as
my
daily
spiritual
food
is
as
intimate
and
difficult
as
to
formulate
the
reasons
for
loving
my
nearest
and
dearest
relatives
and
friends
.
The
Bible
is
as
obviously
and
truly
food
for
the
spirit
as
bread
is
food
for
the
body
.
Again
,
as
faith
reveals
God
my
Father
and
Christ
my
Saviour
,
I
follow
without
question
where
He
leads
me
daily
by
His
Spirit
of
love
,
wisdom
,
power
and
prayer
.
I
place
His
precepts
and
His
leadings
above
every
seeming
probability
,
dismissing
cherished
convictions
and
holding
the
wisdom
of
man
as
folly
when
opposed
to
Him
.
I
discern
no
limits
to
a
faith
vested
in
God
and
Christ
,
who
is
the
sum
of
all
wisdom
and
knowledge
,
and
daring
to
trust
Him
even_though
called
to
stand
alone
before
the
world
.
Our
Lord
's
invitation
with
its
implied
promise
to
all
is
,
``
Come
and
see
''
.
I
stood
at
the
bedside
of
my
patient
one_day
and
beheld
a
very
sick
man
in
terrible
pain
.
As
I
ministered
to
his
needs
,
I
noticed
that
his
face
was
radiant
in_spite_of
his
suffering
and
I
learned
that
he
was
trusting
not_only
in
the
skill
of
his
doctor
and
nurse
but
also
the
Lord
.
In
his
heart
he
had
that
peace
of_which
the
Lord
spoke
when
He
said
,
``
Peace
I
leave
with
you
,
my
peace
I
give
unto
you
:
not
as
the
world
giveth
,
give
I
unto
you
.
Let
not
your
heart
be
troubled
,
neither
let
it
be
afraid
''
.
What
a
joy
to
realize
that
we
,
too
,
can
claim
this
promise
tendered
by
the
Lord
during
His
earthly
ministry
to
a
group
of
men
who
were
very
dear
to
Him
.
He
was
about
to
leave
them
,
to
depart
from
this
world
,
and
return
to
His
Father
in
Heaven
.
Before
He
left
them
He
promised
that
His
peace
would
be
their
portion
to
abide
in
their
hearts
and
minds
.
I
praise
God
for
the
privilege
of
being
a
nurse
who
has
that
peace
through
faith
in
the
Lord
Jesus_Christ
.
It
makes
my
work
a
great_deal
easier
to
be
able
to
pray
for
the
Lord
's
guidance
while
ministering
to
the
physical
needs
of
my
patients
.
How
often
have
I
looked_to
Jesus
when
entering
the
sick
room
,
asking
for
His
presence
and
help
in
my
professional
duties
as
I
give
my
talents
not_only
as
the
world
giveth
but
as
one
who
loves
the
Saviour
and
His
creatures
.
Looking
unto
God
,
the
Prophet_Isaiah
wrote
these
blessed
words
almost
three
thousand
years
ago
:
``
Thou
wilt
keep
him
in
perfect
peace
,
whose
mind
is
stayed
on
thee
:
because
he
trusteth
in
thee
''
.
Are
you
longing
for
peace
in
your
heart
?
Such
a
calm
and
assuring
peace
can
be
yours
.
As
only
a
member
of
the
family
can
share_in
the
innermost
joys
of
the
family
,
likewise
one
must
belong_to
the
family
of
God
in_order_to
receive
the
benefits
that
are
promised
to
those
who
are
His
own
.
Perhaps
you
are
not
His
child
.
Perhaps
you
do
not
know
if
you
belong
to
Him
.
You
may
know
that
you
are
in
God
's
family
and
be
just_as
sure
of_it
as
you
are
that
you
belong_to
the
family
of
your
earthly
father
.
``
God
so
loved
the
world
,
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
Son
,
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
,
but
have
everlasting
life
''
,
and
``
as_many
as
received
him
,
to
them
gave
he
power
to
become
the
sons
of
God
,
even
to
them
that
believe
on
his
name
''
.
It
is
to
those
who
believe
on
His
name
and
belong
to
Him
that
He
gives
His
peace
;
not
that
empty
peace
the
world
offers
,
but
a
deep
,
abiding
peace
which
nothing
can
destroy
.
Why
not
open
your
heart
to
the
Lord
Jesus_Christ
now
,
accept
Him
as
your
Saviour
and
let
Him
fill
you
with
peace
that
only
He
can
give
.
Then
,
with
the
hymn
writer
of
old
,
you
can
say
:
``
I
am
resting
today
in
His
wonderful
peace
,
Resting
sweetly
in
Jesus
'
control
.
I
am
kept
from
all
danger
by
night
and
by
day
,
And
His
glory
is
flooding
my
soul
``
.
Satellites
,
sputniks
,
rockets
,
balloons
;
what
next
?
Our
necks
are
stiff
from
gazing
at
the
wonders
of
outer_space
,
which
have
captured
the
imagination
of
the
American
public
.
Cape_Canaveral
's
achievements
thunder
forth
from
the
radio
,
television
,
and
newspaper
.
While
we
are
filling
outer_space
with
scientific
successes
,
for
many
the
``
inner
''
space
of
their
soul
is
an
aching
void
.
Proof
?
An
average
of
50
suicides
are
reported
in
America
each_day
!
One
out
of
every
three
or
four
marriages
end
in
divorce
!
Over
$
200000000
is
paid
yearly
to
the
80000
full-time
fortune-tellers
in
the
United_States
by
fearful
mankind
who
want
to
``
know
''
what
the
future
holds
!
Delinquency
,
juvenile
and
adult
,
is
at
an
all-time
high
!
Further
proof
?
Read
your
daily
newspaper
!
Unfortunately
,
in
our
rush
to
beat
the
Russians
,
we
have
forgotten
these
truth-packed
words
of
Jesus_Christ
:
``
What
shall
it
profit
a
man
,
if
he
shall
gain
the
whole
world
[
that
includes
outer_space
]
,
and
lose
his
own
soul
?
Or
what
shall
a
man
give
in
exchange
for
his
soul
''
?
(
Mark
8
:
36
,
37
)
.
Gaining
outer_space
and
losing
``
inner
''
space
is
bad
business
according
to
God
's
standards
.
It
is
true
that
we
must
keep_up
our
national
defenses
and
scientific
accomplishments
;
only
a
fool
would
think
otherwise
.
But
we
must_not
forget
man
's
soul
.
Is
putting
a
rocket
in
orbit
half
so
significant
as
the
good
news
that
God
put
His
Son
,
Jesus_Christ
,
on
earth
to
live
and
die
to
save
our
hell-bound
souls
?
``
For
God
so
loved
the
world
,
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
Son
,
that
whosoever
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
,
but
have
everlasting
life
''
(
John
3
:
16
)
.
Never
forget
that
a
chain
is
only
as
strong
as
its
weakest
link
.
Your
spiritual
``
inner
''
space
helps
determine
the
spirituality
of
America
as
a
nation
.
We
trust
you
are
not_one
of
the
70000000
Americans
who
do
not
attend
church
,
but
who
feel
that
various
forms
of
recreation
are
more
important
than
worshipping
the
God
who
made
our
country
great
.
Is
forgiveness
of
past
sins
,
assurance
of
present
help
,
and
hope
of
future
bliss
in
your
orbit
?
Or
are
you
trying
the_devil
's
substitutes
to
relieve
that
spiritual
hunger
you
feel
within
?
Pleasure
,
fame
and
fortune
,
drowning
your
troubles
with
a
drink
,
and
``
living_it_up
''
with
the
gang
are
like
candy_bars
when
you
're
hungry
:
they
may
ease
your
hunger
temporarily
,
but
they
'll
never
take
the
place
of
a
satisfying
,
mouth-watering
steak
.
So
it
is
spiritually
.
No
amount
of
religious_ceremonies
or
even
joining
a
church
will
relieve
the
gnawing
of
your
``
inner
''
space
.
Why
?
Because
your
soul
was
made
to
be
filled
with
God
Himself
,
not
religious
functions
``
about
''
Him
.
Only
He
can
satisfy
the
deepest
longings
.
That
is
why
the
Bible
commands
you
to
``
Taste
and
see
that
the
Lord
is
good
:
blessed
[
happy
]
is
the
man
that
trusteth
in
him
''
(
Psalm
34
:
8
)
.
You
can
receive
God
into
your
heart
and
life
by
a
step
of
personal
faith
.
Accept
the
sinless
Son
of
God
,
Jesus_Christ
,
as
your
own
personal
Saviour
.
