There
are
,
so
my
biologist
friends
tell
me
,
mechanisms
of
adaptation
and
defense
that
are
just
too
complete
and
too
satisfactory
.
Mollusks
are
a
case_in_point
.
The
shell
,
which
served
the
strain
so
well
at
a
relatively
early
stage
in
the
evolutionary
scheme
,
tended
to
cancel_out
the
possibility
of
future
development
.
Though
this
may
or
may_not
be
good
biology
,
it
does
aptly
illustrate
the
strength
and
the
weakness
of
American_Catholic
higher
education
.
There
can
be
no_doubt
that
the
American_Catholic
accomplishment
in
the
field
of
higher
education
is
most
impressive
:
our
European
brethren
never
cease
to
marvel
at
the
number
and
the
size
of
our
colleges
and
universities
.
The
deeper
wonder
is
how
this
miracle
was
accomplished
in
decades
,
rather_than
in
centuries
and
by
immigrant
minorities
at
that
.
By
way
of
explanation
we
ourselves
are
prone
to
imagine
that
this
achievement
stems
from
the
same
American_Catholic
zeal
and
generosity
which
brought
the
parochial_school
system
into
existence
.
There
is
,
however
,
one
curious
discrepancy
in_this
broad
and
flattering
picture
.
Viewing
the
American_Catholic
educational
achievement
in
retrospect
,
we
may
indeed
see
it
as
a
unified
whole
extending
from
grade_school
to
university
.
But
the
simple
truth
is
that
higher
education
has
never
really
been
an
official
American_Catholic
project
;
certainly
not
in
the
same
sense
that
the
establishment
of
a
parochial_school
system
has
been
a
matter
of
official
policy
.
Official
encouragement
is
one
thing
,
but
the
down-to-earth
test
is
the
allocation
of
diocesan
and
parochial
funds
.
American_Catholics
have
responded
generously
to
bishops
'
and
pastors
'
appeals
for
the
support
necessary
to
create
parochial_schools
but
they
have
not
contributed
in
a
similar
fashion
to
the
establishment
of
institutions
of
higher
learning
.
They
have
not
done
so
for
the
simple
reason
that
such
appeals
have
hardly
ever
been
made
.
Diocesan
authorities
generally
have
not
regarded
this
as
their
direct
responsibility
.
All_of
this
may
be
understandable
enough
:
it
is
,
however
,
in_fact
difficult
to
see
how
diocesan
authorities
could
have
acted
otherwise
.
Yet
for
better
or
for
worse
,
the
truth
of
the_matter
is
that
most
American_Catholic
colleges
do
not
owe
their
existence
to
general
Catholic
support
but
rather
to
the
initiative
,
resourcefulness
and
sacrifices
of
individual
religious
communities
.
Community
esprit_de_corps
has
been
the
protective
shell
which
has
made
the
achievement
possible
.
To
understand
the
past
history
-
and
the
future
potential
-
of
American_Catholic
higher
education
,
it
is
necessary
to
appreciate
the
special
character
of
the
esprit
d
'
corps
of
the
religious
community
.
It
is
something
more_than
the
arithmetical
sum
of
individual
totals
of
piety
and
detachment
.
A
religious
community
with
a
vital
sense
of
mission
achieves
a
degree
of
group
orientation
and
group
identification
seldom
found
elsewhere
.
The
fact
that
the
group
orientation
and
group
identification
are_founded
on
supernatural
principles
and
nourished
by
the
well-springs
of
devotion
simply
give
them
a
deeper
and
more
satisfying
dimension
.
The
net
result
is
a
uniquely
satisfying
sense
of
comradeship
,
the
kind_of
comradeship
which
sparks
enthusiasm
and
blunts
the
cutting_edge
of
sacrifice
and
hardship
.
American_Catholic
colleges
and
universities
are
,
in
a
very
real
sense
,
the
product
of
``
private
enterprise
''
-
the
``
private
enterprise
''
of
religious
communities
.
Had
it
not
been
for
such
private
enterprise
,
diocesan
authorities
might
of_course
have
been
goaded
into
establishing
institutions
subsidized
by
diocesan
funds
and
parish
collections
and
staffed
by
religious
as
paid
employees
.
There
is
however
no
point
in
speculating
about
such
a
possibility
:
the
fact
of
the_matter
is
that
our
institutions
of
higher
learning
owe
their
existence
to
a
spirit
not
unlike
that
which
produces
the
``
family
business
''
.
This
``
family-community
''
spirit
is
the
real
explanation
of
the
marvel
of
our
achievement
.
It
is
this
spirit
which
explains
some
of
the
anomalies
of
American_Catholic
higher
education
,
in_particular
the
wasteful
duplication
apparent
in
some
areas
.
I
think
for_example
of
three
women
's
colleges
with
pitifully
small
enrollments
,
clustered
within
a_few
miles
of
a
major
Catholic
university
,
which
is
also
co-educational
.
This
is
not
an
isolated
example
;
this
aspect
of
the
total
picture
has
been
commented
upon
often
enough
.
It
would
seem
to
represent
esprit_de_corps
run
riot
.
Apart
,
however
,
from
the
question
of
wasteful
duplication
,
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
``
family
business
''
spirit
in
American_Catholic
higher
education
which
deserves
closer
scrutiny
.
For
while
the
past
needs
of
the
Church
in_this
country
may
have
been
adequately
met
by
collegiate
institutions
,
which
in
temper
and
tone
closely
resembled
junior_colleges
and
finishing
schools
,
it
would
seem
that
today
's
need
is
for
the
college
which
more
closely
resembles
the
university
in
its
``
pursuit
of
excellence
''
.
At
the
earlier
``
pre-academic
excellence
''
stage
of
Catholic
education
,
the
operation
could
be
conducted
on
an
intra-mural
community
basis
.
But
with
today
's
demand
for
professional
qualifications
and
specialized
training
,
the
need
for
``
outsiders
''
become
more
pressing
.
The
problem
is
not
merely
that
more
``
outside
teachers
''
are
needed
but
that
a
different
brand
is
called_for
.
Commenting
on
the
earlier
stage
,
the
Notre_Dame
Chapter
of
the
American_Association
of
University_Professors
(
in
a
recent
report
on
the
question
of
faculty
participation
in
administrative
decision-making
)
noted
that
the
term
``
teacher-employee
''
(
as
opposed
to
,
e._g.
,
``
maintenance
employee
''
)
was
a
not
inapt
description
.
Today
however
,
the
``
outsider
''
is
likely
to
have
professional
qualifications
of
the
highest
order
(
otherwise
the
college
would
not
be
interested
in
hiring
him
)
and
to
be
acclimatized
to
the
democratic
processes
of
the
secular
or
state
university
.
And
while
no
one
expects
total
democracy
on
the
academic
scene
,
the
scholar
will
be
particularly
sensitive
to
a
line
between
first
and
second_class
citizenship
drawn_on
any
basis
other_than
that
of
academic
rank
or
professional
achievement
.
In
the
above
mentioned
report
of
the
Notre_Dame
Chapter
of
the
American_Association
of
University_Professors
,
the
basic
outlook
of
the
new
breed
of
lay
faculty
emerges
very
clearly
in
the
very
statement
of
the
problem
as
the
members
see
it
:
``
Even
with
the
best
of
intentions
he
(
the
President
of
the
university
)
is
loath
to
delegate
such
authority
and
responsibility
to
a
group
the
membership
of_which
,
considered
(
as
it
must
be
by
him
)
in
individual
terms
,
is
inhomogeneous
,
mortal
and
of
extremely
varying
temperament
,
interests
and
capabilities
.
It
is
natural
that
he
should
turn
for
his
major
support
to
a
select
and
dedicated
few
from
the
organization
which
actually
owns
the
university
and
whose
goals
are
,
in
their
opinion
,
identified
with
its
highest
good
and
(
to
use
that
oft-repeated
phrase
)
'
the
attainment
of
excellence
''
'
.
The
pattern
here
pictured
is
clearly
not
peculiar_to
Notre_Dame
:
it
is
simply
that
the
paradox
involved
in_this
kind_of
control
of
the
institution
by
``
the
organization
which
actually
owns
''
it
,
becomes
more
obvious
where
there
is
a
larger
and
more
distinguished
``
outside
''
faculty
.
It
is
particularly
interesting
that
those
who
framed
the
report
should
refer
to
``
the
organization
which
actually
owns
the
university
''
:
this
seems
to
show
an
awareness
of
the
fact
that
there
is
more
to
the
problem
than
the
ordinary
issue
of
clerical-lay
tension
.
But
in_any_case
,
one
does
not
have
to
read
very
closely
between
the
lines
to
realize
that
the
situation
is
not
regarded_as
a
particularly
happy
one
.
``
Outside
''
faculty_members
want
to
be
considered
partners
in
the
academic
enterprise
and
not
merely
paid
employees
of
a
family
business
.
There
are
two
reasons
why
failure
to
come_to_grips
with
this
demand
could
be
fatal
to
the
future
of
the
Catholic
university
.
In_the_first_place
there
is
the
obvious
problem
of
recruiting
high
caliber
personnel
.
Word
spreads
rapidly
in
the
tightly_knit
academic
profession
,
much
given
to
attending
meetings
and
conferences
.
Expressions
of
even
low-key
dissatisfaction
by
a
Catholic
college
faculty_member
has
the
effect
of
confirming
the
already
existing
stereotype
.
In
the
academic
world
there
is
seldom
anything
so
dramatic
as
a
strike
or
a
boycott
:
all
that
happens
is
that
the
better
qualified
teacher
declines
to
gamble
two
or
three
years
of
his
life
on
the
chance
that
conditions
at
the
Catholic
institution
will
be
as_good_as
those
elsewhere
.
To
appreciate
the
nature
of
the
gamble
,
it
should
be
realized
that
while
college
teaching
is
almost
a
public
symbol
of
security
,
that
security
does
not
come
as
quickly
or
as
automatically
as
it
does
in
an
elementary_school
system
or
in
the
Civil_Service
.
Much
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
major
Catholic
institutions
now
guarantee
firm
tenure
.
This
is
a
significant
advance
but
its
import
should
not
be
exaggerated
.
When
a
man
invests
a
block
of
his
years
at
a
university
without
gaining
the
coveted
promotion
,
not_only
is
he
faced
with
the
problem
of
starting
over
but
there
is
also
a
certain
depreciation
in
the
market_value
of
his
services
.
A
man
does
not
make
that
kind_of
gamble
if
he
suspects
that
one
or
more
of
the
limited
number
of
tenure
positions
is
being
reserved
for
members
of
the
``
family
''
.
Just_as
it
is
possible
to
exaggerate
the
drawing
power
of
the
new
tenure
practices
,
it
is
also
possible
to
exaggerate
the
significance
of
the
now
relatively
adequate
salaries
paid
by
major
Catholic
institutions
.
Adequate
compensation
is
indispensable
.
Yet
adequate
compensation
-
and
particularly
merely
adequate
compensation
is
no
substitute
for
those
intangibles
which
cause
a
man
to
sacrifice
part
of
his
earning
potential
by
taking_up
college
teaching
in_the_first_place
.
Broadly
speaking
the
total
Catholic
atmosphere
is
such
an
intangible
but
the
larger
demand
is
for
a
sense
of
creative
participation
and
mature
responsibility
in
the
total
work
of
the
university
.
Religious
who
derive
their
own
sense
of
purpose
through
identification
with
the
religious
community
rather_than
the
academic
community
are
prone
to
underestimate
both
the
layman
's
reservoir
of
idealism
and
his
need
for
this
identification
.
There
is
no
need
here
to
spell_out
the
conditions
of
creative
teaching
except
to
point_out
that
,
at
the
college_level
,
the
sense
of
community
and
of
community
responsibility
is
even
more
necessary
than
it
is
at
other
levels
.
The
college
teacher
needs
the
stimulus
of
communication
with
other
faculty_members
but
he
also
needs
to
feel
that
such
communication
,
even
informal
debates
over
the
luncheon
table
,
are
a
contribution
to
the
total
good
of
the
institution
.
But
this
in_turn
means
that
decisions
are
not
merely
imposed
from
the
top
but
that
there
be
some
actual
mechanism
of
faculty
participation
.
The
second
reason
for
being
concerned
with
the
dichotomy
between
faculty_members
who
are
part
of
the
``
in-group
''
that
owns
and
operates
the
institution
and
those
who
are
merely
paid
employees
,
is
,
therefore
,
the
baneful
effect
on
the
caliber
of
the
teaching
itself
.
This
is
a
problem
that
goes
considerably
beyond
questions
of
salary
and
tenure
.
Yet
though
it
may
seem
difficult
to
envision
any
definitive
resolution
of
the
problem
of
ownership
and
control
,
there
are
nevertheless
certain
suggestions
which
seem
to
be
in_order
.
The
first
is
a
negative
warning
:
there
is
no
point
in
the
creation
of
faculty
committees
and
advisory_boards
with
high-sounding
titles
but
no
real
authority
.
In
the
case
of
academic
personnel
the
``
feeling
''
of
participation
can
hardly
be
``
faked
''
.
Competent
teachers
are
well
versed
in
the
technique
of
leading
students
to
pre-set
conclusions
without
destroying
the
students
'
illusion
that
they
are
making
their
own
decisions
.
Those
who
have
served
as
faculty
advisers
are
too
familiar_with
the
useful
but
artificial
mechanisms
of
student
government
to
be
taken_in
by
``
busy-work
''
and
ersatz
decision_making
.
In_any_case
it
is
by_no_means
clear
that
formally
structured
organs
of
participation
are
what
is
called_for
at_all
.
In
the
Notre_Dame
report
,
reference
was
made
to
the
fact
that
faculty_members
were
reduced
to
``
luncheon-table
communication
''
.
In
itself
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
form
of
``
participation
''
:
the
only
difficulty
on
the
Catholic
campus
is
that
those
faculty_members
who
are
in
a
position
to
implement
policy
,
i.
e.
,
members
of
the
religious
community
which
owns
and
administers
the
institution
,
have
their
own
eating
arrangements
.
