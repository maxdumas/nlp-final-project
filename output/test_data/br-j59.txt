Rather
than
being
deceived
,
the
eye
is
puzzled
;
instead
of
seeing
objects
in
space
,
it
sees
nothing
more
than
-
a
picture
.
Through
1911
and
1912
,
as
the
Cubist
facet-plane
's
tendency
to
adhere
to
the
literal
surface
became
harder
and
harder
to
deny
,
the
task
of
keeping
the
surface
at
arm's_length
fell
all
the
more
to
eye-undeceiving
contrivances
.
To
reinforce
,
and
sometimes
to
replace
,
the
simulated
typography
,
Braque
and
Picasso
began
to
mix
sand
and
other
foreign
substances
with
their
paint
;
the
granular
texture
thus
created
likewise
called_attention_to
the
reality
of
the
surface
and
was
effective
over
much
larger
areas
.
In
certain
other
pictures
,
however
,
Braque
began
to
paint
areas
in
exact
simulation
of
wood
graining
or
marbleizing
.
These
areas
by_virtue_of
their
abrupt
density
of
pattern
,
stated
the
literal
surface
with
such
new
and
superior
force
that
the
resulting
contrast
drove
the
simulated
printing
into
a
depth
from
which
it
could
be
rescued
-
and
set
to
shuttling
again
-
only
by
conventional
perspective
;
that_is
,
by
being
placed
in
such
relation
to
the
forms
depicted
within
the
illusion
that
these
forms
left
no
room
for
the
typography
except
near
the
surface
.
The
accumulation
of
such
devices
,
however
,
soon
had
the
effect
of
telescoping
,
even
while
separating
,
surface
and
depth
.
The
process
of
flattening
seemed
inexorable
,
and
it
became
necessary
to
emphasize
the
surface
still
further
in_order
to
prevent
it
from
fusing
with
the
illusion
.
It
was
for
this
reason
,
and
no
other
that
I
can
see
,
that
in
September
1912
,
Braque
took
the
radical
and
revolutionary
step
of
pasting
actual
pieces
of
imitation
woodgrain
wallpaper
to
a
drawing
on
paper
,
instead
of
trying
to
simulate
its
texture
in
paint
.
Picasso
says
that
he
himself
had
already
made
his
first
collage
toward
the
end
of
1911
,
when
he
glued
a
piece
of
imitation
caning
oilcloth
to
a
painting
on
canvas
.
It
is
true
that
his
first
collage
looks
more
Analytical
than
Braque
's
,
which
would
confirm
the
date
he
assigns
it
.
But
it
is
also
true
that
Braque
was
the
consistent
pioneer
in
the
use
of
simulated
textures
as_well_as
of
typography
;
and
moreover
,
he
had
already
begun
to
broaden
and
simplify
the
facet-planes
of
Analytical_Cubism
as
far
back
as
the
end
of
1910
.
When
we
examine
what
each
master
says
was
his
first
collage
we
see
that
much
the
same
thing
happens
in
each
.
(
It
makes
no
real
difference
that
Braque
's
collage
is
on_paper
and
eked_out
in
charcoal
,
while
Picasso
's
is
on
canvas
and
eked_out
in
oil
.
)
By
its
greater
corporeal
presence
and
its
greater
extraneousness
,
the
affixed
paper
or
cloth
serves
for
a
seeming
moment
to
push
everything
else
into
a
more
vivid
idea
of
depth
than
the
simulated
printing
or
simulated
textures
had
ever
done
.
But
here
again
,
the
surface
declaring
device
both
overshoots
and
falls_short_of
its
aim
.
For
the
illusion
of
depth
created
by
the
contrast
between
the
affixed
material
and
everything
else
gives_way
immediately
to
an
illusion
of
forms
in
bas-relief
,
which
gives_way
in_turn
,
and
with
equal
immediacy
,
to
an
illusion
that
seems
to
contain
both
-
or
neither
.
Because
of
the
size
of
the
areas
it
covers
,
the
pasted
paper
establishes
undepicted
flatness
bodily
,
as
more
than
an
indication
or
sign
.
Literal
flatness
now
tends
to
assert
itself
as
the
main
event
of
the
picture
,
and
the
device
boomerangs
:
the
illusion
of
depth
is
rendered
even
more
precarious
than
before
.
Instead
of
isolating
the
literal
flatness
by
specifying
and
circumscribing
it
,
the
pasted
paper
or
cloth
releases
and
spreads
it
,
and
the
artist
seems
to
have
nothing
left
but
this
undepicted
flatness
with
which
to
finish
as_well_as
start
his
picture
.
The
actual
surface
becomes
both
ground
and
background
,
and
it
turns_out
-
suddenly
and
paradoxically
-
that
the
only
place
left
for
a
three-dimensional
illusion
is
in_front
of
,
upon
,
the
surface
.
In
their
very
first
collages
,
Braque
and
Picasso
draw
or
paint
over
and
on
the
affixed
paper
or
cloth
,
so
that
certain_of
the
principal
features
of
their
subjects
as
depicted
seem
to
thrust_out
into
real
,
bas-relief
space
-
or
to
be
about
to
do
so
-
while
the
rest
of
the
subject
remains
imbedded
in
,
or
flat
upon
,
the
surface
.
And
the
surface
is
driven
back
,
in
its
very
surfaceness
,
only
by
this
contrast
.
In
the
upper
center
of
Braque
's
first
collage
,
Fruit_Dish
(
in
Douglas_Cooper
's
collection
)
,
a
bunch
of
grapes
is
rendered
with
such
conventionally
vivid
sculptural
effect
as
to
lift
it
practically
off
the
picture_plane
.
The
trompe-l'oeil
illusion
here
is
no_longer
enclosed
between
parallel
flatnesses
,
but
seems
to
thrust
through
the
surface
of
the
drawing_paper
and
establish
depth
on
top
of_it
.
Yet
the
violent
immediacy
of
the
wallpaper
strips
pasted
to
the
paper
,
and
the
only
lesser
immediacy
of
block_capitals
that
simulate
window
lettering
,
manage
somehow
to
push
the
grape
cluster
back
into
place
on
the
picture_plane
so
that
it
does
not
``
jump
''
.
At_the_same_time
,
the
wallpaper
strips
themselves
seem
to
be
pushed
into
depth
by
the
lines
and
patches
of
shading
charcoaled
upon
them
,
and
by
their
placing
in_relation_to
the
block_capitals
;
and
these
capitals
seem
in_turn
to
be
pushed_back
by
their
placing
,
and
by
contrast
with
the
corporeality
of
the
woodgraining
.
Thus
every
part
and
plane
of
the
picture
keeps
changing
place
in
relative
depth
with
every_other
part
and
plane
;
and
it
is
as
if
the
only
stable
relation
left
among
the
different
parts
of
the
picture
is
the
ambivalent
and
ambiguous
one
that
each
has
with
the
surface
.
And
the
same
thing
,
more_or_less
,
can
be
said
of
the
contents
of
Picasso
's
first
collage
.
In
later
collages
of
both
masters
,
a
variety
of
extraneous
materials
are
used
,
sometimes
in
the
same
work
,
and
almost
always
in_conjunction_with
every
other
eye-deceiving
and
eye-undeceiving
device
they
can
think_of
.
The
area
adjacent
to
one
edge
of
a
piece
of
affixed
material
-
or
simply
of
a
painted
in
form
-
will
be
shaded
to
pry
that
edge
away
from
the
surface
,
while
something
will
be
drawn
,
painted
or
even
pasted
over
another
part
of
the
same
shape
to
drive
it
back
into
depth
.
Planes
defined
as
parallel
to
the
surface
also
cut
through
it
into
real
space
,
and
a
depth
is
suggested
optically
which
is
greater
than
that
established
pictorially
.
All
this
expands
the
oscillation
between
surface
and
depth
so_as
to
encompass
fictive
space
in_front
of
the
surface
as_well_as
behind
it
.
Flatness
may
now
monopolize
everything
,
but
it
is
a
flatness
become
so
ambiguous
and
expanded
as
to
turn_into
illusion
itself
-
at_least
an
optical
if_not
,
properly_speaking
,
a
pictorial
illusion
.
Depicted
,
Cubist
flatness
is
now
almost
completely
assimilated
to
the
literal
,
undepicted
kind
,
but
at_the_same_time
it
reacts
upon
and
largely
transforms
the
undepicted
kind
-
and
it
does
so
,
moreover
,
without
depriving
the
latter
of
its
literalness
;
rather
,
it
underpins
and
reinforces
that
literalness
,
re-creates
it
.
Out
of_this
re-created
literalness
,
the
Cubist
subject
reemerged
.
For
it
had
turned_out
,
by
a
further
paradox
of
Cubism
,
that
the
means
to
an
illusion
of
depth
and
plasticity
had
now
become
widely
divergent
from
the
means
of
representation
or
imaging
.
In
the
Analytical
phase
of
their
Cubism
,
Braque
and
Picasso
had
not_only
had
to
minimize
three-dimensionality
simply
in_order
to
preserve
it
;
they
had
also
had
to
generalize
it
-
to
the
point
,
finally
,
where
the
illusion
of
depth
and
relief
became
abstracted
from
specific
three-dimensional
entities
and
was
rendered
largely
as
the
illusion
of
depth
and
relief
as_such
:
as
a
disembodied
attribute
and
expropriated
property
detached
from
everything
not
itself
.
In_order
to
be
saved
,
plasticity
had
had
to
be
isolated
;
and
as
the
aspect
of
the
subject
was
transposed
into
those
clusters
of
more_or_less
interchangeable
and
contour
obliterating
facet-planes
by
which
plasticity
was
isolated
under
the
Cubist
method
,
the
subject
itself
became
largely
unrecognizable
.
Cubism
,
in
its
1911
-
1912
phase
(
which
the_French
,
with
justice
,
call
``
hermetic
''
)
was
on
the
verge
of
abstract_art
.
It
was
then
that
Picasso
and
Braque
were
confronted
with
a
unique
dilemma
:
they
had
to
choose
between
illusion
and
representation
.
If
they
opted_for
illusion
,
it
could
only
be
illusion
per_se
-
an
illusion
of
depth
,
and
of
relief
,
so
general
and
abstracted
as
to
exclude
the
representation
of
individual
objects
.
If
,
on_the_other_hand
,
they
opted_for
representation
,
it
had
to
be
representation
per_se
-
representation
as
image
pure_and_simple
,
without
connotations
(
at_least
,
without
more
than
schematic
ones
)
of
the
three-dimensional
space
in
which
the
objects
represented
originally
existed
.
It
was
the
collage
that
made
the
terms
of_this
dilemma
clear
:
the
representational
could
be
restored
and
preserved
only
on
the
flat
and
literal
surface
now
that
illusion
and
representation
had
become
,
for_the_first_time
,
mutually_exclusive
alternatives
.
In_the_end
,
Picasso
and
Braque
plumped_for
the
representational
,
and
it
would
seem
they
did
so
deliberately
.
(
This
provides
whatever
real
justification
there
is
for
the
talk
about
``
reality
''
.
)
But
the
inner
,
formal_logic
of
Cubism
,
as
it
worked
itself
out
through
the
collage
,
had
just
as
much
to
do
with
shaping
their
decision
.
When
the
smaller
facet-planes
of
Analytical_Cubism
were
placed
upon
or
juxtaposed
with
the
large
,
dense
shapes
formed
by
the
affixed
materials
of
the
collage
,
they
had
to
coalesce
-
become
``
synthesized
''
-
into
larger
planar
shapes
themselves
simply
in_order
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
picture_plane
.
Left
in
their
previous
atom-like
smallness
,
they
would
have
cut_away
too
abruptly
into
depth
;
and
the
broad
,
opaque
shapes
of
pasted
paper
would
have
been
isolated
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
them
jump_out
of
plane
.
Large
planes
juxtaposed
with
other
large
planes
tend
to
assert
themselves
as
independent
shapes
,
and
to_the_extent
that
they
are
flat
,
they
also
assert
themselves
as
silhouettes
;
and
independent
silhouettes
are
apt
to
coincide
with
the
recognizable
contours
of
the
subject
from
which
a
picture
starts
(
if
it
does
start
from
a
subject
)
.
It
was
because
of
this
chain-reaction
as_much_as
for
any
other
reason
-
that_is
,
because
of
the
growing
independence
of
the
planar
unit
in
collage
as
a
shape
-
that
the
identity
of
depicted_objects
,
or
at_least
parts
of
them
,
re-emerged
in
Braque
's
and
Picasso
's
papiers
colles
and
continued
to
remain
more
conspicuous
there
-
but
only
as
flattened
silhouettes
-
than
in
any
of
their
paintings
done
wholly
in
oil
before
the
end
of
1913
.
Analytical_Cubism
came
to
an
end
in
the
collage
,
but
not
conclusively
;
nor
did
Synthetic_Cubism
fully
begin
there
.
Only
when
the
collage
had
been
exhaustively
translated
into
oil
,
and
transformed
by
this
translation
,
did
Cubism
become
an
affair
of
positive
color
and
flat
,
interlocking
silhouettes
whose
legibility
and
placement
created
allusions
to
,
if_not
the
illusion
of
,
unmistakable
three-dimensional
identities
.
Synthetic_Cubism
began
with
Picasso
alone
,
late
in
1913
or
early
in
1914
;
this
was
the_point
at
which
he
finally
took
the
lead
in
Cubist
innovation
away
from
Braque
,
never
again
to
relinquish
it
.
But
even
before
that
,
Picasso
had
glimpsed
and
entered
,
for
a
moment
,
a
certain
revolutionary
path
in
which
no
one
had
preceded
him
.
It
was
as
though
,
in_that
instant
,
he
had
felt
the
flatness
of
collage
as
too
constricting
and
had
suddenly
tried
to
escape
all_the_way
back
-
or
forward
-
to
literal
three-dimensionality
.
This
he
did
by
using
utterly
literal
means
to
carry
the
forward
push
of
the
collage
(
and
of
Cubism
in_general
)
literally
into
the
literal
space
in_front
of
the
picture_plane
.
Some
time
in
1912
,
Picasso
cut_out
and
folded
a
piece_of_paper
in
the
shape
of
a
guitar
;
to
this
he
glued
and
fitted
other
pieces_of_paper
and
four
taut
strings
,
thus
creating
a
sequence
of
flat
surfaces
in
real
and
sculptural
space
to
which
there
clung
only
the
vestige
of
a
picture_plane
.
The
affixed
elements
of
collage
were
extruded
,
as_it_were
,
and
cut_off
from
the
literal
pictorial
surface
to
form
a
bas-relief
.
