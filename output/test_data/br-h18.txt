With
this
enlarged
role
in
mind
,
I
should_like
to
make
a_few
suggestions
:
What
we
in
the
United_States
do
or
do
not
do
will
make
a
very
large
difference
in
what
happens
in
the
rest
of
the
world
.
We
in
this
Department
must
think_about
foreign_policy
in
its
total
context
.
We
cannot
regard
foreign_policy
as
something
left_over
after
defense_policy
or
trade_policy
or
fiscal_policy
has
been
extracted
.
Foreign_policy
is
the
total
involvement
of
the
American
people
with
peoples
and
governments
abroad
.
That
means
that
,
if
we
are
to
achieve
a
new
standard
of
leadership
,
we
must
think
in_terms_of
the
total
context
of
our
situation
.
It
is
the
concern
of
the
Department_of_State
that
the
American
people
are
safe
and
secure
-
defense
is
not
a
monopoly
concern
of
the
Department_of_Defense
.
It
is
also
the
concern
of
the
Department_of_State
that
our
trading
relationships
with
the
rest
of
the
world
are
vigorous
,
profitable
,
and
active
-
this
is
not
just
a
passing
interest
or
a
matter
of
concern
only
to
the
Department_of_Commerce
.
We
can
no_longer
rely_on
interdepartmental
machinery
``
somewhere
upstairs
''
to
resolve
differences
between
this
and
other
departments
.
Assistant_Secretaries_of_State
will
now
carry
an
increased
burden
of
active
formulation
and
coordination
of
policies
.
Means
must
be
found
to
enable
us
to
keep
in
touch
as
regularly
and
as
efficiently
as
possible
with
our
colleagues
in
other
departments
concerned
with
foreign_policy
.
I
think
we
need
to
concern
ourselves
also
with
the
timeliness
of
action
.
Every
policy
officer
cannot
help
but
be
a
planning
officer
.
Unless
we
keep
our
eyes
on
the
horizon
ahead
,
we
shall
fail
to
bring
ourselves
on
target
with
the
present
.
The
movement
of
events
is
so
fast
,
the
pace
so
severe
,
that
an
attempt
to
peer
into
the
future
is
essential
if
we
are
to
think
accurately
about
the
present
.
If
there
is
anything
which
we
can
do
in
the
executive_branch
of
the
Government
to
speed_up
the
processes
by
which
we
come_to
decisions
on
matters
on_which
we
must
act
promptly
,
that
in
itself
would
be
a
major
contribution
to
the
conduct
of
our
affairs
.
Action
taken
today
is
often
far
more
valuable
than
action
taken
several
months
later
in
response
to
a
situation
then
out
of
control
.
There
will
of_course
be
times
for
delay
and
inaction
.
What
I
am
suggesting
is
that
when
we
delay
,
or
when
we
fail
to
act
,
we
do
so
intentionally
and
not
through
inadvertence
or
through
bureaucratic
or
procedural
difficulties
.
I
also
hope
that
we
can
do
something
about
reducing
the
infant_mortality_rate
of
ideas
-
an
affliction
of
all
bureaucracies
.
We
want
to
stimulate
ideas
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
of
the
Department
.
We
want
to
make
sure
that
our
junior
colleagues
realize
that
ideas
are
welcome
,
that
initiative
goes
right
down
to
the
bottom
and
goes
all_the_way
to
the
top
.
I
hope
no
one
expects
that
only
Presidential
appointees
are
looked_upon
as
sources
of
ideas
.
The
responsibility
for
taking
the
initiative
in
generating
ideas
is
that
of
every
officer
in
the
Department
who
has
a
policy
function
,
regardless
of
rank
.
Further
,
I
would
hope
that
we
could
pay_attention
to
little
things
.
While
observing
the
operations
of
our
Government
in
various
parts
of
the
world
,
I
have
felt
that
in
many
situations
where
our
policies
were
good
we
have
tended
to
ignore
minor
problems
which
spoiled
our
main
effort
.
To
cite
only
a_few
examples
:
The
wrong
man
in
the
wrong
position
,
perhaps
even
in
a
junior
position
abroad
,
can
be
a
source
of
great
harm
to
our
policy
;
the
attitudes
of
a
U.N.
delegate
who
experiences
difficulty
in
finding
adequate
housing
in
New_York_City
,
or
of
a
foreign
diplomat
in
similar
circumstances
in
our
Capital
,
can
be
easily
be
directed
against
the
United_States
and
all
that
it
stands_for
.
Dozens
of
seemingly
small
matters
go_wrong
all_over
the
world
.
Sometimes
those
who
know
about
them
are
too
far
down
the
line
to
be
able
to
do
anything
about
them
.
I
would
hope
that
we
could
create
the
recognition
in
the
Department
and
overseas
that
those
who
come_across
little
things
going_wrong
have
the
responsibility
for
bringing
these
to
the
attention
of
those
who
can
do
something
about
them
.
If
the
Department_of_State
is
to
take
primary
responsibility
for
foreign_policy
in
Washington
,
it
follows
that
the
ambassador
is
expected
to
take_charge
overseas
.
This
does
not
mean
in
a
purely
bureaucratic
sense
but
in
an
active
,
operational
,
interested
,
responsible
fashion
.
He
is
expected
to
know
about
what
is
going_on
among
the
representatives
of
other
agencies
who
are
stationed
in
his
country
.
He
is
expected
to
supervise
,
to
encourage
,
to
direct
,
to
assist
in
any
way
he
can
.
If
any
official
operation
abroad
begins
to
go_wrong
,
we
shall
look_to
the
ambassador
to
find_out
why
and
to
get
suggestions
for
remedial
action
.
It
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
be
interested
in
some
thoughts
which
I
expressed
privately
in
recent
years
,
in
the
hope
of
clearing_up
a
certain
confusion
in
the
public
mind
about
what
foreign_policy
is
all
about
and
what
it
means
,
and
of
developing
a
certain
compassion
for
those
who
are
carrying
such
responsibilities
inside
Government
.
I
tried
to
do
so
by
calling
to
their
attention
some
of
the
problems
that
a
senior
departmental
policy
officer
faces
.
This
means
practically
everybody
in
this
room
.
Whether
it
will
strike_home
for
you
or
not
will
be
for
you
to
determine
.
The
senior
policy
officer
may
be
moved
to
think
hard
about
a
problem
by
any
of
an
infinite
variety
of
stimuli
:
an
idea
in
his
own
head
,
the
suggestions
of
a
colleague
,
a
question
from
the
Secretary
or
the
President
,
a
proposal
by
another
department
,
a
communication
from
a
foreign
government
or
an
American
ambassador
abroad
,
the
filing
of
an
item
for
the
agenda
of
the
United_Nations
or
of
any
other
of
dozens
of
international
bodies
,
a
news_item
read
at
the
breakfast_table
,
a
question
to
the
President
or
the
Secretary
at
a
news_conference
,
a
speech
by
a
Senator
or
Congressman
,
an
article
in
a
periodical
,
a
resolution
from
a
national
organization
,
a
request
for
assistance
from
some
private
American
interests
abroad
,
et_cetera
,
ad_infinitum
.
The
policy
officer
lives
with
his
antennae
alerted
for
the
questions
which
fall
within
his
range
of
responsibility
.
His
first
thought
is
about
the
question
itself
:
Is
there
a
question
here
for
American
foreign_policy
,
and
,
if
so
,
what
is
it
?
For
he
knows
that
the
first
and
sometimes
most
difficult
job
is
to
know
what
the
question
is
-
that
when
it
is
accurately
identified
it
sometimes
answers
itself
,
and
that
the
way
in
which
it
is
posed
frequently
shapes
the
answer
.
Chewing
it
over
with
his
colleagues
and
in
his
own
mind
,
he
reaches
a
tentative
identification
of
the
question
-
tentative
because
it
may
change
as
he
explores
it
further
and
because
,
if
no
tolerable
answer
can
be
found
,
it
may
have
to
be
changed
into
one
which
can
be
answered
.
Meanwhile
he
has
been
thinking_about
the
facts
surrounding
the
problem
,
facts
which
he
knows
can
never
be
complete
,
and
the
general
background
,
much
of
which
has
already
been
lost
to
history
.
He
is
appreciative
of
the
expert
help
available
to
him
and
draws
these
resources
into
play
,
taking_care
to
examine
at_least
some
of
the
raw_material
which
underlies
their
frequently
policy
oriented
conclusions
.
He
knows
that
he
must
give
the
expert
his
place
,
but
he
knows
that
he
must
also
keep
him
in
it
.
He
is
already
beginning
to
box
the
compass
of
alternative
lines
of
action
,
including
doing
nothing
.
He
knows
that
he
is
thinking_about
action
in_relation_to
a
future
which
can
be
perceived
but
dimly
through
a
merciful
fog
.
But
he
takes
his
bearings
from
the
great
guidelines
of
policy
,
well
established
precedents
,
the
commitments
of
the
United_States
under
international
charters
and
treaties
,
basic
statutes
,
and
well
understood
notions
of
the
American
people
about
how
we
are
to
conduct
ourselves
,
in
policy
literature
such_as
country
papers
and
National_Security_Council
papers
accumulated
in
the
Department
.
He
will
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
general
principles
produce
conflicting
results
in
the
factual
situation
with
which
he
is
confronted
.
He
must
think_about
which
of
these
principles
must
take
precedence
.
He
will
know
that
general
policy
papers
written
months
before
may
not
fit
his
problem
because
of
crucial
changes
in
circumstance
.
He
is
aware
that
every
moderately
important
problem
merges
imperceptibly
into
every
other
problem
.
He
must
deal
with
the
question
of
how
to
manage
a
part
when
it
cannot
be
handled
without
relation_to
the
whole
-
when
the
whole
is
too_large
to
grasp
.
He
must
think_of
others
who
have
a
stake
in
the
question
and
in
its
answer
.
Who
should
be
consulted
among
his
colleagues
in
the
Department
or
other
departments
and
agencies
of
the
Government
?
Which
American
ambassadors
could
provide
helpful
advice
?
Are
private
interests
sufficiently
involved
to
be
consulted
?
What
is
the
probable
attitude
of
other
governments
,
including
those
less
directly
involved
?
How
and
at
what
stage
and
in
what
sequence
are
other
governments
to
be
consulted
?
If
action
is
indicated
,
what
kind
of
action
is
relevant
to
the
problem
?
The
selection
of
the
wrong
tools
can
mean
waste
,
at_best
,
and
at_worst
an
unwanted
inflammation
of
the
problem
itself
.
Can
the
President
or
the
Secretary
act
under
existing
authority
,
or
will
new
legislation
and
new
money
be
required
?
Should
the
action
be
unilateral
or
multilateral
?
Is
the
matter
one
for
the
United_Nations
or
some_other
international
body
?
For
,
if
so
,
the
path
leads
through
a
complex
process
of
parliamentary
diplomacy
which
adds
still
another
dimension
to
the
problem
.
What
type
of
action
can
hope
to
win
public
support
,
first
in
this
country
and
then
abroad
?
For
the
policy
officer
will
know
that
action
can
almost
never
be
secret
and
that
in_general
the
effectiveness
of
policy
will
be
conditioned
by
the
readiness
of
the
country
to
sustain
it
.
He
is
interested
in
public
opinion
for
two
reasons
:
first
,
because
it
is
important
in
itself
,
and
,
second
,
because
he
knows
that
the
American
public
cares
about
a
decent
respect
for
the
opinions
of
mankind
.
And
,
given
probable
public
attitudes
-
about
which
reasonably
good
estimates
can
be
made
-
what
action
is
called_for
to
insure
necessary
support
?
May
I
add
a
caution
on
this
particular
point
?
We
do
not
want
policy
officers
below
the
level
of
Presidential
appointees
to
concern
themselves
too_much
with
problems
of
domestic
politics
in
recommending
foreign_policy
action
.
In_the_first_place
our
business
is
foreign_policy
,
and
it
is
the
business
of
the
Presidential
leadership
and
his
appointees
in
the
Department
to
consider
the
domestic
political
aspects
of
a
problem
.
Mr._Truman
emphasized
this
point
by
saying
,
``
You
fellows
in
the
Department_of_State
do
n't
know
much
about
domestic
politics
''
.
This
is
an
important
consideration
.
If
we
sit
here
reading
editorials
and
looking
at
public_opinion_polls
and
other
reports
that
cross
our
desks
,
we
should
realize
that
this
is
raw
,
undigested
opinion
expressed
in
the
absence
of
leadership
.
What
the
American
people
will
do
turns
in
large
degree
on
their
leadership
.
We
cannot
test
public_opinion
until
the
President
and
the
leaders
of
the
country
have
gone
to
the
public
to
explain
what
is
required
and
have
asked
them
for
support
for
the
necessary
action
.
I
doubt
,
for_example
,
that
,
3
months
before
the
leadership
began
to
talk_about
what
came
to
be
the
Marshall_plan
,
any
public-opinion
expert
would
have
said
that
the
country
would
have
accepted
such
proposals
.
The
problem
in
the
policy
officer
's
mind
thus
begins
to
take_shape
as
a
galaxy
of
utterly
complicated
factors
-
political
,
military
,
economic
,
financial
,
legal
,
legislative
,
procedural
,
administrative
-
to
be
sorted_out
and
handled
within
a
political_system
which
moves
by
consent
in_relation_to
an
external
environment
which
cannot
be
under_control
.
And
the
policy
officer
has
the
hounds
of
time
snapping_at_his_heels
.
