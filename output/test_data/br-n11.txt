The
author
of
the
anonymous
notes
seemed
to
be
all-knowing
.
For
men
who
had
left
cattle
alone
after
getting
their
first
notices
had
received
no
second
.
But
the
day
of
the
deadline
came
and
passed
,
and
the
men
who
had
scoffed
at
the
warnings
laughed
with
satisfaction
.
For
,
with
a
single
exception
,
nothing
had
happened
to
them
.
The
exception
was
an
Iron_Mountain
settler
named
William_Lewis
.
After
walking
out
to
his
corral
that
morning
,
he
'd
been
amazed
to
see
the
dust
puff_up
in_front
of
his
feet
.
A
split_second
later
,
the
distant
crack
of
a
rifle
had
sounded
.
He
'd
mounted_up
immediately
and
raced
with
a
revolver
ready
toward
the
spot
from
which
he
'd
estimated
the
shot
had
come
.
But
he
had
found
all_of
the
thickets
and
points
of
cover
deserted
.
There
had
been
no
sign
of
a
rifleman
and
no
track
or
trace
to
show
that
anyone
had
been
near
.
Lewis
was
a
man
who
had
made
a
full-time
job
of
cow
stealing
.
He
had
n't
even
pretended
to
be
farming
his
spread
.
His
land
had
never
been
plowed
.
He
had
done
his
rustling
openly
and
boasted
about
it
.
He
had
received
both
first
and
second
anonymous
notices
,
and
each
time
he
had
accused
his
neighbors
of
writing
them
.
He
had
cursed
at
them
and
threatened
them
.
He
was
a
man
,
those
neighbors
testified
later
,
who
did
n't
have
a
friend
in
the
world
.
William_Lewis
made
the
rounds
of
all
who
lived
near
him
again
,
that
August
morning
after
a
bullet
landed
at
his
feet
,
and
once_more
he
accused
and
threatened
everyone
.
``
I
'll
be
ready
next
time
''
!
he
raged
.
``
I
'll
be
shootin
'
right
back
''
.
He
had
his
chance
the
very
next
morning
,
for
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
again
.
This
time
Lewis
had
his
own
rifle
in
his
hands
,
and
he
threw
some
answering
fire
back
at
the
mysterious
far-off
shot
,
then
spent
most_of
the
day
searching
out
the
area
.
He
found
nothing
,
but
he
still
refused
to
give_up
and
move
out
.
``
Just
let
me
meet_up_with
that
damned
bushwhackin
'
coward
face-to-face
''
!
he
exploded
.
``
That
's
all
I
ask
''
!
He
never
got
that
chance
.
For
the
unseen
,
ghostlike
rifleman
aimed
a_little
higher
the
third
time
.
A
.30-30
bullet
smashed
directly
into
the
center
of
William_Lewis
'
chest
.
He
slumped
against
a
log
fence_rail
,
then
tried
to
lift
himself
.
Two
more
shots
followed
in
quick
succession
,
dropping
him
limp
and
huddled
on
the
ground
.
An
inquest
was
held
,
and
after
a
good_deal
of
testimony
about
the
anonymous
notes
,
the
county
coroner
estimated
that
the
shooting
had
been
done
from
a
distance
of
300
yards
.
Rumors
of
the
offer
Tom_Horn
had
made
at
the
Stockgrowers'_Association
meeting
had
leaked_out
by
then
,
and
as
a
grand_jury
investigation
of
the
murder
got
underway
,
the
prosecuting_attorney
,
a
Colonel_Baird
,
ordered
that
the
tall
stock
detective
be
summoned
for
questioning
.
It
took
some
time
to
locate
Horn
.
He
was
finally
found
in
the
Bates_Hole
region
of
Natrona_County
,
two
counties
away
.
Prosecutor_Baird
immediately
assumed
he
was
hiding_out
there
after
the
shooting
and
began
preparing
an
indictment
.
But
that
indictment
was
never
made
.
For
Tom_Horn
,
it
turned_out
,
had
a
number
of
rancher
and
cowboy
witnesses
ready
and
willing
to
swear
with
straight_faces
that
he
had
been
in
Bates_Hole
the
day
of
the
killing
.
The
former
scout
's
alibi
could
n't
be
shaken
.
The
authorities
had
to
release
him
.
He
immediately
rode
on
to
Cheyenne
,
threw
a
ten
day
drinking
spree
and
dropped
some
very
strong
hints
among
friends
.
``
Dead
center
at
three
hundred
yards
,
that
coroner
said
''
!
he
'd
grin
.
``
Three
shots
in_that
fella
'
fore
he
hit
the
ground
!
You
reckon
there
's
two
men
in_this
state
can
shoot
like
that
''
?
Publicly
,
he
denied
everything
.
Privately
,
he
created
and
magnified
an
image
of
himself
as
a
hired
assassin
.
For
a
blood
chilling
ring
of
terror
to
the
very
sound
of
his
name
was
the
tool
he
needed
for
the
job
he
'd
promised
to
do
.
Tom_Horn
was
soon
back
at_work
,
giving
his
secret
employers
their
money
's
worth
.
A
good
many
beef
hungry
settlers
were
accepting
the
death
of
William_Lewis
as
proof
that
the
warning
notes
were
not
idle
threats
.
The
company
herds
were
being
raided
less
often
,
and
cabins
and
soddies
all_over
the
range
were
standing
deserted
.
But
there
were
other
homesteaders
who
passed
the
Lewis
murder
off
as
a
personal
grudge
killing
,
the
work
of
one
of
his
neighbors
.
The
rustling
problem
was
by_no_means
solved
.
Even
in
the
very
area
where
the
shooting
had
been
done
,
cattle
were
still
disappearing
.
For
less_than
a
dozen
miles
from
the
unplowed
land
of
the
dead
man
lived
another
settler
who
had
ignored
the
warnings
that
his
existence
might
be
foreclosed
on
-
a
blatant
and
defiant
rustler
named
Fred_Powell
.
``
Fred
was
mighty
crude
about
the
way
he
took_in
cattle
''
his
own
hired_man
,
Andy_Ross
,
mentioned
later
.
``
Everyone
knew
it
,
but
he
sort_of
acted
like
he
did
n't
care
who
knew
it
-
even
after
them
notes
came
,
even
after
he
'd
heard
about
Lewis
,
even
after
he
'd
been
shot
at
a
couple
o
'
times
hisself
''
!
On
the
morning
of
September
10
,
1895
,
Powell
and
Ross
rose
at
dawn
and
began
their
day
's
work
.
Haying_time
was
close
at_hand
,
and
they
needed
some
strong
branches
to
repair
a
hay
rack
.
Harnessing
a
team
to
a
buckboard
,
they
drove
out
to
a
willow
lined
creek
about
a
half-mile
off
,
then
climbed_down
and
began
chopping
.
Andy_Ross
had
just
started
swinging
an
ax
at
his
second
willow
when
the
distant
blast
of
a
rifle
sounded
.
He
looked_around
in
surprise
,
then
noticed
that
Fred_Powell
was
clutching
his
chest
.
The
hired_man
ran
over
to
help
his
boss
.
``
My
God
,
I
'm
shot
''
!
Powell
gasped
.
And
he
collapsed
and
died
instantly
.
Ross
had
no
intention
of
searching
for
the
assassin
.
He
heaved
the
dead
man
onto
the
buckboard
,
yelled
and
lashed
at
the
team
and
got_out
of
there
fast
.
But
he
brought
back
the
sheriff
and
several
deputies
,
and
to
the
lawmen
the
entire
affair
seemed
a
repetition
of
the
Lewis
killing
.
A
detailed
scouring
of
the
entire
area
revealed
nothing
beyond
a
ledge
of
rocks
that
might
have
been
the
rifleman
's
hiding_place
.
There
were
no
tracks
of
either
hoofs
or
boots
.
Not
even
an
empty
cartridge
case
could
be
found
.
Once_again
,
Tom_Horn
was
the
first
and
most
likely
suspect
,
and
he
was
brought_in
for
questioning
immediately
.
Once_again
,
he
shook
his
head
,
kept
his
face
expressionless
and
his
voice
very
calm
,
and
had
a
strongly
supported
alibi
ready
.
Later
,
riding
in
for
some
lusty
enjoyment
of
the
liquor
and
professional
ladies
of
Cheyenne
,
he
laid_claim
to
the
killing
with
the
vague
insinuations
he
made
.
``
Exterminatin
'
cow
thieves
is
just
a
business
proposition
with
me
''
,
he
'd
blandly
announce
.
``
And
I
sort_o
'
got
a
corner
on
the
market
''
.
``
Tom
''
,
a
friend
asked
him
once
,
``
how_come
you
bushwhacked
them
rustlers
?
They
would
n't
o
'
stood
no
chance
with
you
in
a
plain
,
straight-out
shoot-down
''
.
He
had
lots
of
friends
,
then
as
always
.
Even
as
he
became
widely
known_as
a
professional
killer
,
nearly
every
cowboy
and
rancher
in
Wyoming
seemed
proud
to
call
him
a
friend
.
No
man
's
name
brought
more
cheers
when
it
was
announced
in
a
rodeo
.
``
Well
''
,
he
explained
,
``
s'posin
you
was
a
nester
swingin
'
the
long
rope
?
Which
would
you
be
most
scairt
of
-
a
dry-gulchin
'
or
a
shoot-down
''
?
``
Yeah
,
I
can
see
that
''
,
the
friend
was
forced
to
agree
.
``
But
,
well
,
it
just
do
n't
seem
sportin
'
somehow
''
!
``
Sportin
''
'
!
The
tall
sunburnt
rustler
hunter
stared
in
amazement
.
``
Sportin
''
'
!
he
echoed
again
in
soft
wonder
.
``
I
seen
a
lot
o
'
things
in
my
time
.
I
found
a
trooper
once
the
Apache
had
spread-eagled
on
an
ant_hill
,
and
another
time
we
ran_across
some
teamsters
they
'd
caught
,
tied
upside_down
on
their
own
wagon_wheels
over
little
fires
until
their
brains
was
exploded
right
out
o
'
their
skulls
.
I
heard
o
'
Texas
cattlemen
wrappin
'
a
cow
thief
up
in
green
hides
and
lettin
'
the
sun
shrink
'
em
and
squeeze
him
to
death
.
But
there
's
one
thing
I
never
seen
or
heard
of
,
one
thing
I
just
do
n't
think
there
is
,
and
that
's
a
sportin
'
way
o
'
killin
'
a
man
''
!
After
the
first
two
murders
,
the
warning
notes
were
rarely
ignored
.
The
lesson
had
been
learned
.
The
examples
were
plain
.
When
Fred_Powell
's
brother-in-law
,
Charlie_Keane
,
moved_into
the
dead
man
's
home
,
the
anonymous
letter_writer
took
no
chances
on
Charlie
taking_up
where
Fred
had
left_off
and
wasted
no
time
on
a
first
notice
:
If
you
do
n't
leave
this
country
within
3
days
,
your
life
will
be
taken
the
same
as
Powell
's
was
.
This
was
the
message
found
tacked
to
the
cabin
door
.
Keane
left
,
within
three
days
.
All
through
Albany
and
Laramie
counties
,
other
men
were
doing
the
same
.
Houses
of
settlers
who
'd
treated
the
company
herds
as
a
natural_resource
,
free
for
the
taking
,
were
sitting
empty
,
with
weeds
growing
high
in
their
yards
.
The
small
half-heartedly
tended
fields
of
men
who
'd
spent
more
time
rustling
cattle
than
farming
were
lying
fallow
.
No
cow
thief
could
count_on
a
jury
of
his
sympathetic
peers
to
free
him
any_longer
.
Jury
,
judge
and
executioner
were
riding
the
range
in
the
form
of
a
single
unknown
figure
that
could
materialize
anywhere
,
at
any
time
,
to
dispense
an
ancient
brand
of
justice
the
men
of
the
new
West
had
believed
long
outdated
.
For
three
straight
years
,
Tom_Horn
patrolled
the
southern
Wyoming
pastures
,
and
how_many
men
he
killed
after
Lewis
and
Powell
(
if
he
killed
Lewis
and
Powell
)
will
never
be
known
.
It
is
possible
,
although
highly
doubtful
,
that
he
killed
none
at_all
but
merely
let
his
reputation
work
for
him
by
privately
claiming
every
unsolved
murder
in
the
state
.
It
is
also
possible
,
but
equally
doubtful
,
that
he
actually
shot
down
the
hundreds
of
men
with
which
his
legend
credits
him
.
For
that
legend
was
growing
explosively
,
Rumor
was
insisting
he
received
a
price
of
$
600
a
man
.
(
The
best
evidence
is
that
he
received
a
monthly
wage
of
about
$
125
,
very
good
money
in
an
era
when
top
hands
worked
for
$
30
and
found
.
)
Rumor
had_it
he
slipped
two
small
rocks
under
each
victim
's
head
as
a
sort
of
trademark
.
(
A
detailed
search
of
old
coroner
's
reports
fails
to
substantiate
this
in
the
slightest
.
)
One
thing
was
certain
-
his
method
was
effective
,
so
effective
that
after
a
time
even
the
warning
notices
were
often
unnecessary
.
The
mere
fact
that
the
tall
figure
with
the
rifle
and
field_glasses
had
been
seen
riding
that
way
was
enough
to
frighten
three
rustling
homesteaders
out
of
the
Upper_Laramie
country
in
a
single
week
.
``
My
reputation
's
my
stock
in
trade
''
,
Tom
mentioned
more_than
once
.
He
evidently
could
n't
foresee
that
it
might
be
his
downfall
in_the_end
.
He
had
made
himself
the
personification
of
the_Devil
to
the
homesteaders
.
But
to
the
cattlemen
who
had
been
facing
bankruptcy
from
rustling
losses
and
to
the
cowboys
who
had
been
faced
with
lay-offs
a_few
years
earlier
,
he
was
becoming
a
vastly
different
type
of
legendary
figure
.
Such
ranchers
as
Coble
and
Clay
and
the
Bosler
brothers
carried
him
on
their
books
as
a
cowhand
even
while
he
was
receiving
a
much
larger
salary
from
parties
unknown
.
He
made
their
spreads
his
headquarters
,
and
he
helped_out
in
their
roundups
.
In
the
cow
camps
,
Tom_Horn
was
regarded_as
a
hero
,
as
the
same
kind
of
champion
he
was
when
he
entered
and
invariably
won
the
local
rodeos
.
The
hands
and
their
bosses
saw
him
as
a
lone
knight
of
the
range
,
waging
a
dedicated
crusade
against
a
lawless
new
society
that
was
threatening
a
beloved
way_of_life
.
The
wailing
,
guitar
strumming
minstrels
of
the
cattle
kingdom
made_up
songs
about
him
.
By
1898
,
rustling
losses
had
been
driven
down
to
the
lowest
level
ever
seen
in
Wyoming
.
