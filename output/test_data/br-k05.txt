Payne
dismounted
in
Madison_Place
and
handed
the
reins
to
Herold
.
There
was
a
fog
,
which
increased
the
darkness
of
the
night
.
Two
gas_lamps
were
no
more
than
a
misleading
glow
.
He
might
have
been
anywhere
or
nowhere
.
The
pretence
was
that
he
was
delivering
a
prescription
from
Dr._Verdi
.
Secretary_of_State
Seward
was
a
sick
man
.
The
idea
had
come
from
Herold
,
who
had
once
been
a
chemist
's
clerk
.
The
sick
were
always
receiving
medicines
.
No_one
would
question
such
an
errand
.
The
bottle
was
filled_up
with
flour
.
Before
Payne
loomed
the
Old_Clubhouse
,
Seward
's
home
,
where
Key
had
once
been
killed
.
Now
it
would
have
another
death
.
From
the
outside
it
was
an
ordinary
enough
house
of
the
gentry
.
He
clomped
heavily
up
the
stoop
and
rang
the
bell
.
Like
the
bell
at
Mass
,
the
doorbell
was
pitched
too
high
.
It
was
still
Good_Friday
,
after_all
.
A
nigger
boy
opened
the
door
.
Payne
did
not
notice
him
.
He
was
thinking
chiefly
of
Cap
.
If
their
schedules
were
to
synchronize
,
there
was
no
point
in
wasting_time
.
He
pushed
his
way
inside
.
For
a
moment
the
hall
confused
him
.
This
was
the
largest
house
he
had
ever
been
in
,
almost
the
largest
building
,
except
for
a
hotel
.
He
had
no
idea
where
Seward
's
room
would
be
.
In
the
half
darkness
the
banisters
gleamed
,
and
the
hall
seemed
enormous
.
Above
him
somewhere
were
the
bedrooms
.
Seward
would
be
up
there
.
He
explained
his
errand
,
but
without
bothering
much
to
make
it
plausible
,
for
he
felt
something
well_up
in
him
which
was
the
reason
why
he
had
fled
the
army
.
He
did
not
really
want
to
kill
,
but
as
in
the
sexual_act
,
there
was
a
moment
when
the
impulse
took_over
and
could
not
be
downed
,
even
while
you
watched
yourself
giving_way
to
it
.
He
was
no_longer
worried
.
Everything
would
be
all_right
.
He
knew
that
in
this
mood
he
could
not
be
stopped
.
Still
,
the
sensation
always
surprised
him
.
It
was
a
thrill
he
felt
no
part
in
.
He
could
only
watch
with
a
sort
of
gentle
dismay
while
his
body
did
these
quick
,
appalling
,
and
efficient
things
.
He
brushed
by
the
idiotic
boy
and
lumbered
heavily
up_the_stairs
.
They
were
carpeted
,
but
made
for
pumps
and
congress_gaiters
,
not
the
great
clodhoppers
he
wore
.
The
sound
of
his
footsteps
was
like
a
muffled
drum
.
At
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
ran_into
somebody
standing
there
angrily
in
a
dressing_gown
.
He
stopped
and
whispered
his
errand
.
Young_Frederick_Seward
held_out
his
hand
.
Panting
a_little
,
Payne
shook
his
head
.
Dr._Verdi
had
told
him
to
deliver
his
package
in_person
.
Frederick_Seward
said
his
father
was
sleeping
,
and
then
went
through
a
pantomime
at
his
father
's
door
,
to
prove
the
statement
.
``
Very_well
''
,
Payne
said
.
``
I
will
go
''
.
He
smiled
,
but
now
that
he
knew
where
the
elder
Seward
was
,
he
did
not
intend
to
go
.
He
pulled_out
his
pistol
and
fired
it
.
It
made
no
sound
.
It
had
misfired
.
Reversing
it
,
he
smashed
the
butt
down
on
Frederick_Seward
's
head
,
over_and_over_again
.
It
was
the
first
blow
that
was
always
difficult
.
After
that
,
violence
was
exultantly
easy
.
He
got
caught_up
into
it
and
became
a
different
person
.
Only
afterwards
did
an
act
like
that
become
meaningless
,
so
that
he
would
puzzle_over
it
for
days
,
whereas
at
the
time
it
had
seemed
quite
real
.
The
nigger
boy
fled
down_the_stairs
,
screaming
,
``
Murder
''
.
It
was
not
murder
at_all
.
Payne
was
more
methodical
than
that
.
He
was
merely
clearing
a
way
to
what
he
had_to
do
.
He
ran
for
the
sick_room
,
found
his
pistol
was
broken
,
and
threw_it_away
.
A
knife
would
do
.
From
childhood
he
had
known
all
about
knives
.
Someone
blocked
the
door
from
inside
.
He
smashed
it
in
and
tumbled
into
darkness
.
He
saw
only
dimly
moving
figures
,
but
when
he
slashed
them
they
yelled
and
fled
.
He
went_for
the
bed
,
jumped_on
it
,
and
struck
where
he
could
,
repeatedly
.
It
was
like
finally
getting_into
one
's
own
nightmares
to
punish
one
's
dreams
.
Two
men
pulled
him
off
.
Nobody
said
anything
.
Payne
hacked
at
their
arms
.
There
was
a
lady
there
,
in
a
nightdress
.
He
would
not
have
wanted
to
hurt
a
lady
.
Another
man
approached
,
this
one
fully
dressed
.
When
the
knife
went_into
his
chest
,
he
went_down
at_once
.
``
I'm
mad
''
,
shouted
Payne
,
as
he
ran_out
into
the
hall
.
``
I'm
mad
''
,
and
only
wished
he
had
been
.
That
would
have
made
things
so
much
easier
.
But
he
was
not
mad
.
He
was
only
dreaming
.
He
clattered
down_the_stairs
and
out
of
the
door
.
Somewhere
in
the
fog
,
the
nigger
boy
was
still
yelling
murder
.
One
always
wakes_up
,
even
from
one
's
own
dreams
.
The
clammy
air
revived
him
.
Herold
,
he
saw
,
had
fled
.
Well
,
one
did
not
expect
much
of
people
like
Herold
.
He
unhitched
his
horse
,
walked
it
away
,
mounted
,
and
spurred
it
on
.
The
nigger
boy
was
close
behind
him
.
Then
the
nigger
boy
turned_back
and
he
was
alone
.
He
rode
on
and
on
.
He
had
no
idea
where
he
was
.
After
some
time
he
came
to
an
open
field
.
An
open
field
was
better
than
a
building
,
that
was
for_sure
,
so
he
dismounted
,
turned
off
the
horse
,
and
plunged
through
the
grass
.
He
felt
curiously
sleepy
,
the
world
seemed
far
away
;
he
knew
he
should
get
to
Cap
,
but
he
did
n't
know
how
.
He
was
sure
,
for
he
had
done
as
he
was
told
,
had
n't
he
?
Cap
would
find
him
and
take
care
of
him
.
So
choosing
a
good
tree
,
he
clambered
up
into
it
,
found
a
comfortable
notch
,
and
curled_up
in
it
to
sleep
,
like
the
tousled
bear
he
was
,
with
his
hands
across
his
chest
,
as
though
surfeited
with
honey
.
Violence
always
made
him
tired
,
but
he
was
not
frightened
.
In
Boston
,
Edwin_Booth
was
winding_up
a
performance
of
A_New_Way_to_Pay_Old_Debts
.
It
was
a
part
so
familiar
to
him
that
he
did
not
bother
to
think_about
it
any_more
.
Acting
soothed
him
.
On
a
stage
he
always
knew
what
to
do
,
and
tonight
,
to
judge
by
the
applause
,
he
must
be
doing
it
better
than
usual
.
As
Sir_Giles_Overreach
(
how
often
had
he
had_to
play
that
part
,
who
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
)
,
he
raised
his
arm
and
declaimed
:
``
Where
is
my
honour
now
''
?
That
was
one
of
the
high
spots
of
the
play
.
The
audience
,
as_usual
,
loved
it
.
He
was
delighted
to
see
them
so
happy
.
If
he
had
any
worries
,
it
was
only
the
small
ones
,
about
Mother
in
New_York
,
and
his
daughter
Edwina
and
what
she
might
be
doing
at
this
hour
,
with
her
Aunt_Asia
,
in
Philadelphia
.
Everyone
is
ambivalent
about
his
profession
,
if
he
has
practised
it
long
enough
,
but
there
were
still
moments
when
he
loved
the
stage
and
all
those
unseen
people
out
there
,
who
might
cheer
you
or
boo
you
,
but
that
was
largely
,
though
not
entirely
,
up_to_you
.
They
made
the
world
seem
friendly
somehow
,
though
he
knew
it
was
not
.
Wilkes
was
quite
right
about
one
thing
.
Laura_Keene
had
been
in
the
green_room
.
The
commotion
had
brought
her
into
the
wings
.
Since
she
could
not
act
,
one
part
suited
her
as
well
as
any
other
,
and
so
she
was
the
first
person
to
offer
Mr._Lincoln
a
glass
of
water
,
holding
it
up
to
the
box
,
high
above
her
head
,
to
Miss_Harris
,
who
had
asked
for
it
.
She
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
collect
her
wits
.
It
was
not
so
much
that
the
shot
had
stunned
the
audience
,
as
that
they
had
been
stunned
already
.
Most
of
them
had
seen
Our_American_Cousin
before
,
and
unless
Miss_Keene
was
on
stage
,
there
was
not
much
to
it
.
The
theatre
was
hot
and
they
were
drugged
with
boredom
.
The
stage
had
been
empty
,
except
for
Harry_Hawk
,
doing
his
star
monologue
.
The
audience
was
fond
of
Harry_Hawk
,
he
was
a
dear
,
in
or
out
of
character
,
but
he
was
not
particularly
funny
.
At
the
end
of
the
monologue
the
audience
would
applaud
.
Meanwhile
it
looked
at
the
scenery
.
``
Well
,
I
guess
I
know
enough
to
turn
you
inside_out
,
you
sockdologizing
old
mantrap
''
!
said
Trenchard
,
otherwise
Hawk
.
There
was
always
a
pause
here
,
before
the
next
line
.
That
was
when
the
gun
went_off
.
Yet
even
that
explosion
did
not
mean
much
.
Guns
were
going_off
all_over
Washington_City
these
days
,
because
of
the
celebrations
,
and
the
theatre
was
not
soundproof
.
Then
the
audience
saw
a
small
,
dim
figure
appear
at
the
edge
of
the
Presidential
box
.
``
Sic
semper
tyrannis
''
,
it
said
mildly
.
Booth
had
delivered
his
line
.
Behind
him
billowed
a
small
pungent
cloud
of
smoke
.
They
strained
forward
.
They
had
not
heard
what
had
been
said
.
They
had
been
sitting
too
long
to
be
able
to
stand_up
easily
.
The
figure
leapt
from
the
box
,
almost
lost
its
balance
,
the
flag
draped
there
tore
in
the
air
,
the
figure
landed
on
its
left
leg
,
fell
on
its
hands
,
and
pressed
itself
up
.
Harry_Hawk
still
had
his
arm
raised
towards
the
wings
.
His
speech
faltered
.
He
did
not
lower
his
arm
.
The
figure
was
so
theatrically
dressed
,
that
it
was
as
though
a
character
from
some
other
play
had
blundered
into
this
one
.
The
play
for
Saturday
night
was
to
be
a
benefit
performance
of
The_Octoroon
.
This
figure
looked_like
the
slave_dealer
from
that
.
But
it
also
looked_like
a
toad
,
hopping
away
from
the
light
.
There
was
something
maimed
and
crazy
about
its
motion
that
disturbed
them
.
Then
it
disappeared
into
the
wings
.
Harry_Hawk
had
not
shifted
position
,
but
he
at_last
lowered
his
arm
.
Mrs._Lincoln
screamed
.
There
was
no
mistaking
that
scream
.
It
was
what
anyone
who
had
ever
seen
her
had
always
expected
her
to
do
.
Yet
this
scream
had
a
different
note
in
it
.
That
absence
of
an
urgent
self-indulgence
dashed
them
awake
like
a
pail
of
water
.
Clara_Harris
,
one
of
the
guests
in
the
box
,
stood_up
and
demanded
water
.
Her
action
was
involuntary
.
When
something
unexpected
happened
,
one
always
asked
for
water
if
one
were
a
woman
,
brandy
if
one
were
a
man
.
Mrs._Lincoln
screamed
again
.
In
the
Presidential
box
someone
leaned
over
the
balustrade
and
yelled
:
``
He
has
shot
the
President
''
!
That
got
everybody
up
.
On
the
stage
,
Harry_Hawk
began
to
weep
.
Laura_Keene
brushed
by
him
with
the
glass
of
water
.
The
crowd
began
to
move
.
In
Washington_City
everyone
lived
in
a
bubble
of
plots
,
and
one
death
might
attract
another
.
It
was
not
exactly
panic
they
gave_way
to
,
but
they
could
not
just
sit
there
.
The
beehive
voices
,
for
no_one
could
bear
silence
,
drowned_out
the
sound
of
Mrs._Lincoln
's
weeping
.
At
the
rear
of
the
auditorium
,
upstairs
,
some
men
tried
to
push
open
the
door
to
the
box
corridor
.
It
would
not
give
.
A
Dr._Charles_Taft
clambered
up
on
the
stage
and
got
the
actors
to
hoist
him
up
to
the
box
.
In
the
audience
a
man
named
Ferguson
lost
his
head
and
tried
to
rescue
a
little
girl
from
the
mob
,
on
the
same
principle
which
had
led
Miss_Harris
to
demand
water
.
Someone
opened
the
corridor
door
from
the
inside
,
and
called_for
a
doctor
.
Somehow
Dr._Charles_Leale
was
forced
through
the
mob
and
squeezed_out
into
the
dingy
corridor
.
He
went
straight
to
the
Presidential
box
.
As_usual
,
Mrs._Lincoln
had
lost
her
head
,
but
nobody
blamed
her
for
doing
so
now
.
There
was
a_little
blood
on
the
hem
of
her
dress
,
for
the
assassin
had
slashed
Miss_Harris
's
companion
,
Major_Rathbone
,
with
a
knife
.
Rathbone
said
he
was
bleeding
to
death
.
By
the
look
of
him
he
was
n't
that
far_gone
.
