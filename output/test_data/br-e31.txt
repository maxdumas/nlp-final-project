The
long
and
ever
increasing
column
of
sportsmen
is
now
moving_into
a
new
era
.
Modern_times
have
changed
the
world
beyond
recognition
.
The
early
years
of
the
twentieth
century
seem
very
far_away
.
But
with
all
the
changes
in
philosophy
,
dress
and
terrain
-
a_few
things
remain
constant
,
including
the
devotion
of
Americans
to
the
great
field_sports
,
hunting
and
fishing
.
As
the
generations
move_on
,
clothes
become
more
suitable
for
the
enjoyment
of
outdoor
sports
.
Sporting
firearms
change
,
markedly
for
the
better
.
Just
as
modern
transportation
has
outmoded
the
early
Studebaker
covered_wagon
,
the
demand
of
today
's
sportsmen
and
women
has
necessitated
changes
in
their
equipment
.
The
American
firearms
and
ammunition
manufacturers
through
diligent
research
and
technical
development
have
replaced
the
muzzle_loader
and
slow
firing
single
shot
arms
with
modern
fast
firing
autoloaders
,
extremely
accurate
bolt
,
lever
,
and
slide_action
firearms
.
And
millions
of
rounds
of
entirely
new
and
modern
small-arms
ammunition
,
designed
for
today
's
hunting
and
target
shooting
.
And
due_to
modern
resource
use
and
game
management
practices
,
there
is
still
game
to
shoot
,
even
with
the
ever
expanding
encroachment
on
land
and
water
.
Present
conservation
practices
regard
wildlife
,
not
as
an
expendable
natural_resource
,
but
as
an
annual
harvest
to
be
sown
and
also
reaped
.
Unlimited
game
bags
are
possible
and
legal
in
more_than
40
states
,
on
shooting_preserves
(
one
of
the
newer
phases
of
modern
game
management
)
for
five
and
six
months
each_year
.
Close
to
two
million
game_birds
were
harvested
on
1500
commercial
and
private
shooting_preserves
,
and
on
State_Game_Commission
controlled
upland
game
areas
during
the
1960
-
61
season
.
The
shooting
development
program
of
the
Sporting_Arms_and_Ammunition_Manufacturers_'_Institute
has
successfully
published
these
facts
in
all
major
outdoor
magazines
,
many
national
weeklies
and
the
trade
papers
.
The
most
effective
way
to
develop
more
places
for
more
sportsmen
to
shoot
is
to
encourage
properly
managed
shooting_preserves
.
This
has
been
the
aim
of
the
director
of
the
shooting
development
program
,
the
New_York
staff
of
the
Sportsmen's_Service_Bureau
,
and
the
SAAMI
shooting_preserve
field
consultants
since
the
start
of
the
program
in
1954
.
Following
the
kick-off
of
SAAMI
's
shooting
development
program
in
1954
,
a
most
interesting
meeting
took_place
in
Washington
,
D._C.
.
The
group
known_as
the
American_Association_for_Health_,_Physical_Education_,_and_Recreation
(
a
division
of
the
National_Education_Association
)
initiated
a
conference
which
brought_together
representatives
of
the
National_Rifle_Association
,
SAAMI
and
the
American_Fishing_Tackle_Manufacturers
.
This
meeting
was
called
to
determine
how
these
groups
might
cooperate
to
launch
what
is
known_as
the
Outdoor_Education_Project
.
The
Outdoor_Education_Project
took
cognizance
of
the
fact
,
so
often
overlooked
,
that
athletic
activities
stressed
in
most
school
programs
have
little
or
no
relationship
to
the
physical
and
mental
needs
and
interests
of
later
life
.
The
various
team
sports
assuredly
have
their
place
in
every
school
,
and
they
are
important
to
proper
physical
development
.
But
with
the
exception
of
professional
athletes
,
few
contact_sports
and
physical_education
activities
in
our
schools
have
any
carryover
in
the
adult
life
of
the
average
American
man
or
woman
.
Following
a
vigorous
campaign
of
interpretation
and
leadership
development
by
OEP
director
Dr._Julian_Smith
,
today
thousands
of
secondary_schools
,
colleges
and
universities
have
shooting
and
hunting
education
in
their
physical_education
and
recreation
programs
.
SAAMI
's
financial
support
since
1955
has
contributed
to
the
success
of
this
project
in
education
.
Personnel
assigned
through
the
shooting
development
program
have
proudly
participated
in
over
53
state
and
regional
workshops
,
at
which
hundreds
of
school
administrators
,
teachers
,
professors
,
and
recreational
leaders
have
been
introduced
to
Outdoor
Education
.
Considering
that
the
current
school
age
potential
is
23
million
youths
,
the
project
and
its
message
on
hunting
and
shooting
education
have
many_more
to
reach
.
In
1959
SAAMI
's
shooting
development
program
announced
a
new
activity
designed
to
expose
thousands
of
teen-age
boys
and
girls
to
the
healthy
fun
enjoyed
through
the
participation
in
the
shooting
sports
.
This
program
is
now
nationally
known_as
``
Teen
Hunter
Clubs
''
.
Teen
Hunter
Clubs
were
initially
sponsored
by
affiliated
members
of
the
Allied_Merchandising_Corporation
.
The
first
program
was
sponsored
by
Abraham_+_Strauss
,
Hempstead
,
New_York
,
under
the
direction
of
Special
Events
director
Jennings_Dennis
.
Other
pilot_programs
were
conducted
by
A_+_S
,
Babylon
,
New_York
;
J._L._Hudson
,
Detroit
;
Joseph_Horne
,
Pittsburgh
.
Other
THC
activities
followed
,
conducted
by
shopping_centers
,
department_stores
,
recreation
equipment
dealers
,
radio
-
TV
stations
,
newspapers
,
and
other
organizations
interested
in
the
need
existing
to
acquaint
youngsters
with
the
proper
use
of
sporting
firearms
and
the
development
of
correct
attitudes
and
appreciations
related_to
hunting
and
wise
use
of
our
natural_resources
.
SAAMI
's
field
men
have
served
as
consultants
and
/
or
have
participated
in
75
Teen
Hunter
Club
activities
which
have
reached
over
40000
enthusiastic
young
Americans
.
Through
the
efforts
of
SAAMI
's
shooting
development
program
these
shooting
activities
,
and
many
others
,
including
assists
in
the
development
of
public
and
privately
financed
shooting
parks
,
trap
and
skeet
leagues
,
rifle
and
pistol
marksmanship
programs
have
been
promoted
,
to
mention
only
a_few
.
The
continuation
and
expansion
of
the
shooting
development
program
will
assure
to
some
degree
that
national
and
community
leaders
will
be
made
aware
of
the
ever
growing
need
for
shooting
facilities
and
activities
for
hunting
and
shooting
in
answer
to
public
demand
.
While
individual
sportsmen
are
aware
of
this
situation
,
too
many_of
our
political
,
social
,
educational
and
even
religious
leaders
too
often
forget
it
.
Help
is
needed
from
dealers
,
at
the
grass-roots
level
.
The
American
gun
and
ammunition
producers
sponsor
a
successful
promotional
program
through
their
industry
trade
association
.
Since
SAAMI
's
conception
in
1926
,
and
more
specifically
since
the
adoption
of
the
Shooting
Development
Program
in
1954
,
millions
of
dollars
and
promotional
man-hours
have
gone_into
the
development
of
more
places
to_shoot
for
more
youths
and
adults
.
We
trust
that
you
,
as
a
gun
and
ammunition
dealer
,
have
benefited
through
additional
sales
of
equipment
.
Are
you
getting
top
dollar
from
the
shooting
sports
?
Are
you
looking
ahead
to
the
exploding
market
of
millions
of
American
boys
and
girls
,
who
will
grow_up
to
enjoy
a
traditional
American
way_of_life
-
ranging
the
fields
with
a
fine
American
gun
and
uniformly
excellent
ammunition
?
Is
your
sporting
firearms
and
ammunition
department
primed
for
the
expanding
horizons
?
Would
you
like
to
organize
Teen
Hunters
Clubs
,
shooting
programs
,
and
have
information
on
seasons
including
six
months
of
hunting
with
unlimited
game
bags
on
shooting_preserves
?

We
were
camping
a_few
weeks
ago
on
Cape_Hatteras_Campground
in
that
land
of
pirates
,
seagulls
and
bluefish
on
North_Carolina
's
famed
Outer_Banks
.
This
beach
campground
with
no
trees
or
hills
presents
a
constant
camping
show
with
all
manner
of
equipment
in
actual
use
.
With
the
whole
camp
exposed
to
view
we
could
see
the
variety
of
canvas
shelters
in
which
Americans
are
camping
now
.
There
were
umbrella_tents
,
wall_tents
,
cottage_tents
,
station_wagon
tents
,
pup_tents
,
Pop_tents
,
Baker
tents
,
tents
with
exterior
frames
,
camper_trailers
,
travel_trailers
,
and
even
a_few
surplus
parachutes
serving
as
sunshades
over
entire
family
camps
.
Moving
around
camp
we
saw
all
kinds
of
camp
stoves
,
lanterns
,
coolers
,
bedding
,
games
,
fishing_tackle
,
windbreaks
and
sunshades
.
We
saw
similar
displays
in
the
other
three
campgrounds
in
this
70
mile
long
National_Seashore_Recreation_Area
.
Dealers
would
do_well
to
visit
such
a
campground
often
,
look
at
the
equipment
and
talk
with
the
campers
.
Here
you
begin
to
appreciate
the
scope
of
the
challenges
and
possibilities
facing
the
industry
.
Camping
is
big
and
getting
bigger
.
No
one
knows
where
it
will
stop
.
Almost
every
official
who
reflects
on_it
thinks
this
movement
of
Americans
to
canvas
dwellings
opens
one
of
the
most
promising
of
all
outdoor
markets
.
You
read
various
guesses
on
how
many
Americans
are
camping
.
The
number
depends_on
who
is
talking
at
the
moment
.
The
figures
range
as
high
as
15
million
families
.
I
've
heard
10
million
mentioned
often
,
but
I
'm
more
inclined
to
think
there
may
be
a
total
of
some
five
to
seven
million
families
camping
.
Seven
million
families
would
total
30
million
Americans
or
more
.
Consider
the
equipment
needed
to
protect
this
many
from
the
weather
,
to
make
their
cooking
easy
and
their
sleeping
comfortable
.
Harassed
state
park
officials
often
have
more
campers
than
they
know
what
to
do
with
.
They
are
struggling
to
meet
the
demand
for
camping
space
,
but
families
are
being
turned_away
,
especially
on
holiday
weekends
.
The
National_Parks
,
always
popular
camping
places
,
are
facing
the
same
pressure
.
The
National_Park_Service
hopes
by
1966
to
have
30000
campsites
available
for
100000
campers
a
day
-
almost
twice
what
there
are
at_present
.
The
U._S._Forest_Service
cares
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
campers
in
its
149
National
Forests
and
is
increasing
its
facilities
steadily
.
But
the
campers
still
come
.
They
bring
their
families
and
tents
and
camp
kitchens
and
bedding
.
They
bring
their
fishing_rods
and
binoculars
and
bathing_suits
.
They
come
prepared
for
family
fun
because
Americans
in
ever
growing
numbers
are
learning
that
here
is
the
way
to
a
fine
economical
vacation
that
becomes
a
family
experience
of
lasting
importance
.
There
are
a
half_dozen
reasons
helping
to
account_for
the
migration
to
the
campgrounds
.
Among
them
,
according
to
the
U._S.
Department_of_Commerce
,
are
:
(
1
)
shorter
work_weeks
,
(
2
)
higher
pay
,
(
3
)
longer
paid_vacations
,
(
4
)
better
transportation
,
(
5
)
earlier
retirement
,
and
(
6
)
more
education
.
The
more
people
learn
about
their
country
,
the
more
they
want
to
learn
.
Camping
is
family
fun
,
and
it
is
helping
more
Americans
see
more
of
the
country
than
they
ever
saw
before
.
But
make
no
mistake
about
it
,
the
first
reason
people
turn_to
camping
is
one
of
economy
.
Here
is
the
promise
of
a
vacation
trip
they
can
afford
.
The
American_Automobile_Association
,
computing
the
cost
for
two
people
to
vacation
by
automobile
,
comes_up
with
an
average
daily
expenditure
figure
of
$
29
.
The
AAA
then
splits
it
down
this
way
:
$
10.50
for
meals
,
$
9.50
for
lodging
,
$
7
for
gas
and
oil
,
and
$
2
for
tips
and
miscellaneous
.
What
does
the
camping
couple
do
to
this
set
of
figures
?
The
$
9.50
for
lodging
they
save
.
Because
they
prepare
their
own
meals
they
also
keep
in
their
pockets
a
good
portion
of
that
$
10.50
food
bill
along
with
most_of
the
tip
money
.
The
automobile
expenses
are
about
the
only
vacationing
cost
they
can
n't
either
eliminate
or
pare_down
drastically
by
camping
along
the
way
.
Where
Americans
used_to
think_of
a
single
vacation
each
summer
,
they
now
think_about
how
many
vacations
they
can
have
.
Long
weekends
enable
many
to
get_away
from
home
for
three
or
four
days
several
times
a
year
.
And
even
if
they
stay
in
resorts
part
of
the
time
,
they
might
,
if
the
right
salesman
gets
them
in
tow
,
develop
a
yearning
to
spice
the
usual
vacation
fare
with
a
camping
trip
into
the
wide
open
spaces
.
It
would
be
a
mistake
to
sell
those
thousands
of
beginning
campers
on
the
idea
they
're
buying
the
comforts
of
home
.
They
're
not
.
Home
is
the
place
to
find
the
comforts
of
home
.
They
're
buying
fun
and
adventure
and
family
experiences
.
But
it
would
also
be
a
mistake
for
them
not
to
realize
how
comfortable
camping
has
become
.
This
is
no_longer
a
way_of_life
for
the
bearded
logger
and
the
wandering
cowboy
.
Today
's
campers
want
comforts
,
and
they
have
them
.
And
this
helps
explain
why
so
many
people
are
now
going
camping
.
It
's
fun
,
and
it
's
easy
-
so
easy
that
there
is
time
left
after
cooking
,
and
tent
keeping
,
for
the
women
to
get_out
and
enjoy
outdoor
fun
with
their
families
.
Camp
meals
are
no
great
problem
.
Neither
are
beds
,
thanks
to
air_mattresses
and
sleeping_bags
.
Neither
are
shelters
,
because
there
is
one
to
meet
the
needs
of
every
camper
or
prospective
camper
.
But
there
is
still
the
sometimes
complex
problem
of
helping
campers
choose
the
best
equipment
for
their
individual
needs
.
