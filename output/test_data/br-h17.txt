It
is
not
a
medieval
mental
quirk
or
an
attitude
``
unnourished
by
sense
''
to
believe
that
husbands
and
wives
should
not
be
subjected
to
such
a
risk
,
or
that
such
a
possibility
should
not
be
permitted
to
endanger
the
confidentiality
of
the
marriage
relationship
.
While
it
is
easy
enough
to
ridicule
Hawkins
'
pronouncement
in
Pleas_of_the_Crown
from
a
metaphysical
point_of_view
,
the
concept
of
the
``
oneness
''
of
a
married_couple
may
reflect
an
abiding
belief
that
the
communion
between
husband
and
wife
is
such_that
their
actions
are
not
always
to
be
regarded
by
the
criminal_law
as
if
there
were
no
marriage
.
By
making
inroads
in
the
name
of
law_enforcement
into
the
protection
which
Congress
has
afforded
to
the
marriage
relationship
,
the
Court
today
continues
in
the
path
charted
by
the
recent
decision
in
Wyatt_v._United_States
,
362_U._S._525
,
where
the
Court
held
that
,
under_the_circumstances
of
that
case
,
a
wife
could
be
compelled
to
testify
against
her
husband
over
her
objection
.
One
need
not
waver
in
his
belief
in
virile
law_enforcement
to
insist
that
there
are
other
things
in
American
life
which
are
also
of
great
importance
,
and
to
which
even
law_enforcement
must
accommodate
itself
.
One
of
these
is
the
solidarity
and
the
confidential
relationship
of
marriage
.
The
Court
's
opinion
dogmatically
asserts
that
the
husband
wife
conspiracy
doctrine
does
not
in_fact
protect
this
relationship
,
and
that
hence
the
doctrine
``
enthrone
[
s
]
an
unreality
into
a
rule
of
law
''
.
I
am
not
easily
persuaded
that
a
rule
accepted
by
so
many
people
for
so
many
centuries
can
be
so
lightly
dismissed
.
But
in_any_event
,
I
submit
that
the
power
to
depose
belongs_to
Congress
,
not
to
this
Court
.
I
dissent

This
is
a
prosecution
for
refusal
to
be
inducted
into

armed_services
,
in
violation
of
the
provisions
of

.
Petitioner
,
who
claims
to
be
a
conscientious_objector
,
contends
that
he
was
denied
due_process
,
both
in
the
proceedings
before
a
hearing_officer
of
the
Department_of_Justice
and
at
trial
.
He
says
that
he
was
not
permitted
to
rebut
before
the
hearing_officer
statements
attributed
to
him
by
the
local
board
,
and
,
further
,
that
he
was
denied
at
trial
the
right
to
have
the
Department_of_Justice
hearing_officer
's
report
and
the
original
report
of
the
Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation
as
to
his
claim
-
all
in
violation
of
the
Fifth_Amendment
.
The
trial_judge
decided
that
the
administrative
procedures
of
the
Act
were
fully
complied
with
and
refused
to
require
the
production
of
such
documents
.
Petitioner
was
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
15
months
'
imprisonment
.
The
Court_of_Appeals
affirmed
.
269_F._2_d_613
.
We
granted
certiorari
in
view
of
the
importance
of
the
questions
in
the
administration
of
the
Act
.
361_U._S._899
.
We
have
concluded
that
petitioner
's
claims
are
controlled
by
the
rationale
of
gonzales_v._United_States
,
348_U._S._407_(_1955_)
,
and
United_States_v._Nugent
,
346_U._S
.1_(_1953
)
,
and
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
.
Petitioner
registered
with
Local_Board_No._9
,
Boulder_,_Colorado
,
on
March
17
,
1952
.
His
answers
to
the
classification
questionnaire
reflected
that
he
was
a
minister
of
Jehovah's_Witnesses
,
employed
at
night
by
a
sugar
producer
.
He
claimed
4_,_-_D
classification
as
a
minister
of
religion
,
devoting
a
minimum
of
100
hours
a
month
to
preaching
.
On
November
13
,
1952
,
he
was
classified
in
Class
1
,
-_A
.
On
November
22
,
1952
,
he
wrote
the
Board
,
protesting
this
classification
.
He
again
stated
that
he
was
``
a
regular
minister
''
;
that
he
was
``
devoting
an
average
of
100
hours
a
month
to
actual
preaching
publicly
''
,
in_addition
to
50
to
75
hours
in
other
ministerial
duties
,
and
that
he
opposed
war
in
any
form
.
Thereafter
he
was
classified
1_,_-_O
.
On
April
1
,
1953
,
after
some
six
months
of
full-time
``
pioneering
''
,
petitioner
discontinued
devoting
100
hours
a
month
to
preaching
,
but
failed
to
so
notify
his
local
board
.
In
a
periodic
review
,
the
local
board
on
July
30
,
1953
,
reclassified
him
1_,_-_A
and
upheld
this
classification
after
a
personal
appearance
by
petitioner
,
because
of
his
willingness
to
kill
in
defense
of
his
church
and
home
.
Upon
administrative
approval
of
the
reclassification
,
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
on
June
11
,
1956
,
but
failed
to
do
so
.
He
was
not
prosecuted
,
however
,
and
his
case
was
subsequently
reopened
,
in
the
light
of
Sicurella_v._United_States
,
348_U._S._385_(_1955_)
.
He
was
again
reclassified
1_,_-_A
by
the
local
board
.
There
followed
a
customary
Department_of_Justice
hearing
,
at
which
petitioner
appeared
.
In
his
report
to
the
Attorney_General
,
the
hearing_officer
suggested
that
the
petitioner
be
exempt
only
from
combatant
training
and
service
.
On
March
21
,
1957
,
however
,
the
Department
recommended
approval
of
the
1_,_-_A
classification
.
Its
ground
for
this
recommendation
was
that
,
while
petitioner
claimed
before
the
local
board
August
17
,
1956
(
as
evidenced
by
its
memorandum
in
his
file
of
that
date
)
,
that
he
was
devoting
100
hours
per
month
to
actual
preaching
,
the
headquarters
of
the
Jehovah's_Witnesses
reported
that
he
was
no_longer
doing
so
and
,
on_the_contrary
,
had
relinquished
both
his
Pioneer_and_Bible_Student_Servant
positions
.
It
reported
that
he
now
devoted
only
some
6
-
1_2
hours
per
month
to
public
preaching
and
from
20
to
25
hours
per
month
to
church
activities
.
His
claim
was
therefore
``
so
highly
exaggerated
''
,
the
Department
concluded
,
that
it
``
cast
doubt
upon
his
veracity
and
,
consequently
,
upon
his
sincerity
and
good_faith
''
.
The
appeal_board
furnished
petitioner
a
copy
of
the
recommendation
.
In
his
answer
thereto
,
he
advised
the
Board
that
he
had
made
no
such
statement
in
1956
,
and
asserted
that
his
only
claim
to
``
pioneering
''
was
in
1952
.
The
appeal_board
,
however
,
unanimously
concurred
in
the
Department
's
recommendation
.
Upon
return
of
the
file
to
the
local
board
,
petitioner
was
again
ordered
to
report
for
induction
and
this
prosecution
followed
his
failure
to
do
so
.
Petitioner
first
contends
that
the
Department
denied
him
procedural
due_process
by
not
giving
him
timely
opportunity
,
before
its
final
recommendation
to
the
appeal_board
,
to
answer
the
statement
of
the
local
board
as
to
his
claim
of
devoting
100
hours
to
actual
preaching
.
But
the
statement
of
the
local
board
attributing
this
claim
to
petitioner
was
in
his
file
.
He
admitted
that
he
knew
it
was
open
to
him
at
all
times
,
and
he
could
have
rebutted
it
before
the
hearing_officer
.
This
he
failed
to
do
,
asserting
that
he
did
not
know
it
to
be
in
his
file
.
Apparently
he
never
took
the
trouble
to
find_out
.
Nevertheless
he
had
ample
opportunity
to
contest
the
statement
before
the
appeal_board
.
After
the
recommendation
of
the
Department
is
forwarded
to
the
appeal_board
,
that
is
the
appropriate
place
for
a
registrant
to
lodge
his
denial
.
This
he
did
.
We
found
in
Gonzales_v._United_States
,
supra
,
that
this
was
the
controlling
reason
why
copies
of
the
recommendation
should
be
furnished
a
registrant
.
We
said
there
that
it
was
necessary
``
that
a
registrant
be
given
an
opportunity
to
rebut
[
the
Department
's
]
recommendation
when
it
comes
to
the
Appeal_Board
,
the
agency
with
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
classification
''
.
348_U._S._,_at_412
.
We
fail
to
see
how
such
procedure
resulted
in
any
prejudice
to
petitioner
's
contention
,
which
was
considered
by
the
appeal
board
and
denied
by
it
.
As
was
said
in
Gonzales
,
``
it
is
the
Appeal_Board
which
renders
the
selective_service
determination
considered
'
final
'
in
the
courts
,
not
to
be
overturned
unless
there
is
no
basis
in
fact
.
Estep_v._United_States
,
327_U._S._114_''
.
348_U._S._,_at_412_-_413
.
But
there
are
other
contentions
which
might
be
considered
more
difficult
.
At
his
trial
,
petitioner
sought
to
secure
through
subpoena_duces_tecum
the
longhand
notes
of
the
Department
's
hearing_officer
,
Evensen
,
as_well
as
his
report
thereon
.
Petitioner
also
claimed
at
trial
the
right
to
inspect
the
original
Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation
reports
to
the
Department_of_Justice
.
He
alleged
no
specific
procedural
errors
or
evidence
withheld
;
nor
did
he
elaborate
just
what
favorable
evidence
the
Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation
reports
might
disclose
.
Section
6_(_j_)
of
the
Act
,
as
we
have
held
,
does
require
the
Department
's
recommendation
to
be
placed
in
a
registrant
's
file
.
Gonzales_v._United_States
,
supra
.
But
there
is
nothing
in
the
Act
requiring
the
hearing_officer
's
report
to
be
likewise
turned_over
to
the
registrant
.
While
the
regulations
formerly
required
that
the
hearing_officer
's
report
be
placed
in
the
registrant
's
file
,
this
requirement
was
eliminated
in
1952
.
Moreover
,
the
hearing_officer
's
report
is
but
intradepartmental
,
is
directed
to
the
Attorney_General
and
,
of_course
,
is
not
the
recommendation
of
the
Department
.
It
is
not
essentially
different
from
a
memorandum
of
an
attorney
in
the
Department_of_Justice
,
of
which
the
Attorney_General
receives
many
,
and
to
which
he
may
give
his
approval
or
rejection
.
It
is
but
part
of
the
whole
process
within
the
Department
that
goes_into
the
making
of
the
final
recommendation
to
the
appeal
board
.
It
is
also
significant
that
neither
this
report
nor
the
hearing_officer
's
notes
were
furnished
to
the
appeal
board
.
Hence
the
petitioner
had
full
opportunity
to
traverse
the
only
conclusions
of
the
Department
on
file
with
the
Board
.
Petitioner
knew
that
the
Department
's
recommendation
was
based
not
on
the
hearing_officer
's
report
but
on
the
statement
of
the
local
board
in
his
file
.
Having
had
every
opportunity
to
rebut
the
finding
of
the
local
board
before
both
the
hearing_officer
and
the
appeal
board
,
petitioner
cannot
now
claim
that
he
was
denied
due_process
because
he
did
not
succeed
.
It
appears
to
us
that
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
the
production
of
the
hearing_officer
's
report
and
notes
at
the
trial
.
In_addition
,
petitioner
has
failed
to
show
any
particular
need
for
the
report
and
notes
.
While
there
are
now
allegations
of
the
withholding
of
``
favorable
evidence
developed
at
the
hearing
''
and
a
denial
of
a
``
full
and
fair
hearing
''
,
no
such
claim
was
made
by
petitioner
at
any
stage
of
the
administrative
process
.
Moreover
,
his
testimony
at
trial
never
developed
any
such
facts
.
In
the
light
of
these
circumstances
,
as_well
as
the
fact
that
the
issue
at
trial
in
this
respect
centered
entirely
on
the
Department
's
recommendation
,
which
petitioner
repudiated
but
which
both
the
appeal
board
and
the
courts
below
found
supported
by
the
record
,
we
find
no
relevancy
in
the
hearing_officer
's
report
and
notes
.
Finally
petitioner
says
that
he
was
entitled
to
inspect
the
FBI
report
during
the
proceedings
before
the
hearing_officer
as_well
as
at
the
trial
.
He
did
receive
a
resume
of
it
-
the
same
that
was
furnished
the
appeal
board
-
and
he
made
no
claim
of
its
inaccuracy
.
Even
now
no
such
claim
is
asserted
.
He
bases
his
present
contention
on
the
general
right
to
explore
,
indicating
that
he
hopes
to
find
some
discrepancy
in
the
resume
.
But
this
is
fully
answered
by
United_States_v._Nugent
,
supra
.
There
we
held
``
that
the
statutory
scheme
for
review
,
within
the
selective_service_system
,
entitles
[
conscientious_objectors
]
to
no
guarantee
that
the
FBI
reports
must
be
produced
for
their
inspection
''
.
346_U._S._,_at_5_-_6
.
Even
if
we
were
not
bound
by
Nugent
,
petitioner
here
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
report
.
The
recommendation
of
the
Department
-
as_well
as
the
decision
of
the
appeal
board
-
was
based
entirely
on
the
local
board
file
,
not
on
an
FBI
report
.
