The
350
th
anniversary
of
the
King_James_Bible
is
being
celebrated
simultaneously
with
the
publishing
today
of
the
New_Testament
,
the
first
part
of
the
New_English_Bible
,
undertaken
as
a
new
translation
of
the
Scriptures
into
contemporary
English
.
Since
it
was
issued
in
the
spring
of
1611
,
the
King_James_Version
has
been
most
generally
considered
the_most
poetic
and
beautiful
of
all
translations
of
the
Bible
.
However
,
Biblical
scholars
frequently
attested
to
its
numerous
inaccuracies
,
as
old
manuscripts
were
uncovered
and
scholarship
advanced
.
This
resulted
in
revisions
of
the
King_James_Bible
in
1881
-
85
as
the_English
Revised_Version
and
in
1901
as
the
American_Standard_Version
.
Then
in
1937
America
's
International_Council
of
Religious
Education
authorized
a
new
revision
,
in
the
light
of
expanded
knowledge
of
ancient
manuscripts
and
languages
.
Undertaken
by
32
American
scholars
,
under
the
chairmanship
of
Rev._Dr._Luther_A._Weigle
,
former
dean
of
Yale_University
Divinity_School
,
their
studies
resulted
in
the
publishing
of
the
Revised_Standard_Version
,
1946
-
52
.
The
New_English_Bible
(
the
Old_Testament
and
Apocrypha
will
be
published
at
a
future
date
)
has
not
been
planned
to
rival
or
replace
the
King_James_Version
,
but
,
as
its
cover
states
,
it
is
offered
``
simply
as
the
Bible
to
all
those
who
will
use
it
in
reading
,
teaching
,
or
worship
''
.
Time
,
of_course
will
testify
whether
the
new
version
will
have
achieved
its
purpose
.
Bible
reading
,
even
more
so
than
good
classical_music
,
grows
in_depth
and
meaning
upon
repetition
.
If
this
new
Bible
does
not
increase
in
significance
by
repeated
readings
throughout
the
years
,
it
will
not
survive
the
ages
as
has
the
King_James_Version
.
However
,
an
initial
perusal
and
comparison
of
some
of
the
famous
passages
with
the
same
parts
of
other
versions
seems
to
speak
well
of
the
efforts
of
the_British
Biblical
scholars
.
One
is
impressed
with
the
dignity
,
clarity
and
beauty
of_this
new
translation
into
contemporary
English
,
and
there
is
no_doubt
that
the
meaning
of
the
Bible
is
more
easily
understandable
to
the
general
reader
in
contemporary
language
than
in
the
frequently
archaic
words
and
phrases
of
the
King_James
.
For_example
,
in
the
third
chapter
of
Matthew
,
verses
13
-
16
,
describing
the
baptism
of
Jesus
,
the
1611
version
reads
:
``
Then
cometh
Jesus
from
Galilee
to
Jordan
unto
John
,
to
be
baptized
of
him
.
``
But
John
forbad
him
,
saying
,
I
have
need
to
be
baptized
of
thee
,
and
comest
thou
to
me
?
``
And
Jesus
answering
said
unto
him
,
Suffer
it
to
be
so
now
:
for
thus
it
becometh
us
to
fulfill
all
righteousness
.
Then
he
suffered
him
.
``
And
Jesus
,
when
he
was
baptized
went_up
straightway
out
of
the
water
:
and
lo
,
the
heavens
were
opened
unto
him
,
and
he
saw
the
Spirit
of
God
descending
like
a
dove
,
and
lighting
upon
him
''
.
Certainly
,
the
meaning
is
clearer
to
one
who
is
not
familiar_with
Biblical
teachings
,
in
the
New_English_Bible
which
reads
:
``
Then
Jesus
arrived_at
Jordan
from
Galilee
,
and
he
came
to
John
to
be
baptized
by
him
.
John
tried
to
dissuade
him
.
'
Do
you
come
to
me
'
?
he
said
;
'
I
need
rather
to
be
baptized
by
you
'
.
Jesus
replied
,
'
let
it
be
so
for
the
present
;
we
do_well
to
conform
this
way
with
all
that
God
requires
'
.
John
then
allowed
him
to
come
.
After
baptism
Jesus
came_up
out
of
the
water
at_once
,
and
at
that
moment
heaven
opened
;
he
saw
the
Spirit
of
God
descending
like
a
dove
to
alight
upon
him
''
;
(
the
paragraphing
,
spelling
and
punctuation
are
reproduced
as
printed
in
each
version
.
)
Among
the_most
frequently
quoted
Biblical
sentences
are
the
Beatitudes
and
yet
so
few
persons
,
other_than
scholars
,
really
understand
the
true
meaning
of
these
eight
blessings
uttered
by
Jesus
at
the
beginning
of
the
Sermon_on_the_Mount
.
To
illustrate
,
the
first
blessing
in
the
King_James_Bible
reads
:
``
Blessed
are
the
poor
in
spirit
;
for
their
's
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
''
.
The
new
version
states
:
``
How
blest
are
those
who
know
that
they
are
poor
;
the
kingdom
of
Heaven
is
theirs
''
.
Some
of
the
poetic
cadence
of
the
older
version
certainly
is
lost
in
the
newer
one
,
but
almost
anyone
,
with
a
fair
knowledge
of
the_English
language
,
can
understand
the
meaning
,
without
the
necessity
of
interpretation
by
a
Biblical
scholar
.
To
a
novice
that
is
significant
.
In
the
second
and
third
chapters
of
Revelation
the
new
version
retains
,
however
,
the
old
phrase
``
angel
of
the
church
''
which
Biblical
scholars
have
previously
interpreted
as
meaning
bishop
.
This
is
not
contemporary
English
.
For_the_most_part
,
however
,
the
new
version
is
contemporary
and
,
as_such
,
should
be
the
means
for
many
to
attain
a
clearer
comprehension
of
the
meaning
of
those
words
recorded
so
many
hundreds
of
years
ago
by
the
first
followers
of
Christ
.
Originally
recorded
by_hand
,
these
words
have
been
copied
and
recopied
,
translated
and
retranslated
through
the
ages
.
Discoveries
recently
made
of
old
Biblical
manuscripts
in
Hebrew
and
Greek
and
other
ancient
writings
,
some
by
the
early
church_fathers
,
in
themselves
called_for
a
restudy
of
the
Bible
.
To
have
the
results
recorded
in
everyday
usable
English
should
be
of
benefit
to
all
who
seek
the
truth
.
There
is
one
danger
,
however
.
With
contemporary
English
changing
with
the
rapidity
that
marks
this
jet
age
,
some
of
the
words
and
phrases
of
the
new
version
may
themselves
soon
become
archaic
.
The
only
answer
will
be
continuous
study
.

New_Testament
