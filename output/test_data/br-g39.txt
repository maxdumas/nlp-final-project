When
Harold_Arlen
returned
to
California
in
the
winter
of
1944
,
it
was
to
take_up
again
a
collaboration
with
Johnny_Mercer
,
begun
some
years
before
.
The
film
they
did
after
his
return
was
an
inconsequential
bit
of
nothing
titled
Out_of_This_World
,
a
satire
on
the
Sinatra
bobby-soxer
craze
.
The
twist
lay
in
using
Bing_Crosby
's
voice
on
the
sound_track
while
leading_man
Eddie_Bracken
mouthed
the
words
.
If
nothing
else
,
at_least
two
good
songs
came_out
of
the
project
,
``
Out_of_This_World
''
and
``
June_Comes_Around_Every_Year
''
.
Though
they
would
produce
some
very
memorable
and
lasting
songs
,
Arlen
and
Mercer
were
not
given
strong
material
to
work_on
.
Their
first
collaboration
came
close
.
Early
in
1941
they
were
assigned
to
a
script
titled
Hot_Nocturne
.
It
purported
to
be
a
reasonably
serious
attempt
at
a
treatment
of
jazz_musicians
,
their
aims
,
their
problems
-
the
tug-of-war
between
the
``
pure
''
and
the
``
commercial
''
-
and
seemed
a
promising
vehicle
,
for
the
two
men
shared
a
common
interest
in
jazz
.
Johnny_Mercer
practically
grew_up
with
the
sound
of
jazz
and
the
blues
in
his
ears
.
He
was_born
in
savannah
,
Georgia
,
in
1909
.
His
father
,
George_A._Mercer
,
was
descended
from
an
honored
Southern
family
that
could
trace
its
ancestry
back
to
one
Hugh_Mercer
,
who
had
emigrated
from
Scotland
in
1747
.
The
lyricist
's
father
was
a
lawyer
who
had
branched_out
into
real_estate
.
His
second
wife
,
Lillian
,
was
the
mother
of
John_H._Mercer
.
By
the
age
of
six
young
Johnny
indicated
that
he
had
the
call
.
One
day
he
followed
the_Irish_Jasper_Greens
,
the
town
band
,
to
a
picnic
and
spent
the
entire
day
listening
,
while
his
family
spent
the
day
looking
.
The
disappearance
caused
his
family
to
assign
a
full-time
maid
to
keeping_an_eye_on
the
boy
.
But
one
afternoon
Mrs._Mercer
met
her
;
both
were
obviously
on_the_way
to
the
Mercer
home
.
The
mother
inquired
,
``
Where
's
Johnny
,
and
why
did
you
leave
him
''
?
``
There
was
nothing
else
I
could
do
''
,
the
maid
answered
,
satisfied
with
a
rather
vague
explanation
.
But
Mrs._Mercer
demanded
more
.
The
maid
then
told
her
,
``
Because
he
fired
me
''
.
With
her
son
evidencing
so
strong
a
musical
bent
his
mother
could
do
little
else
but
get
him
started
on
the
study
of
music
-
though
she
waited
until
he
was
ten
-
beginning
with
the
piano
and
following
that
with
the
trumpet
.
Young
Mercer
showed
a
remarkable
lack
of
aptitude
for
both
instruments
.
Still
,
he
did
like
music
making
and
even
sang
in
the
chapel
choir
of
the
Woodberry_Forest_School
,
near
Orange
,
Virginia
,
where
he
sounded
fine
but
did
not
matriculate
too
well
.
When
he
was
fifteen
John_H._Mercer
turned_out
his
first
song
,
a
jazzy
little
thing
he
called
``
Sister_Susie
,
Strut_Your_Stuff
''
.
If
his
scholarship
and
formal
musicianship
were
not
all
they
might
have
been
,
Mercer
demonstrated
at
an
early
age
that
he
was
gifted
with
a
remarkable
ear
for
rhythm
and
dialect
.
From
his
playmates
in
Savannah
,
Mercer
had
picked_up
,
along
with
a
soft
Southern
dialect
,
traces
also
of
the
Gullah
dialects
of
Africa
.
Such
speech
differences
made
him
acutely
aware
of
the
richness
and
expressivness
of
language
.
During
the
summers
,
while
he
was
still
in
school
,
Mercer
worked
for
his
father
's
firm
as
a
messenger_boy
.
It
generally
took
well
into
the
autumn
for
the
firm
to
recover
from
the
summer
's
help
.
``
We
'd
give
him
things
to
deliver
,
letters
,
checks
,
deeds
and
things
like
that
''
,
remembers
his
half-brother
Walter
,
still
in
the
real_estate
business
in
savannah
,
``
and
learn
days
later
that
he
'd
absent-mindedly
stuffed
them
into
his
pocket
.
There
they
stayed
''
.
This
rather
detached
attitude
toward
life
's
encumbrances
has
seemed
to
be
the
dominant
trait
in
Mercer
's
personality
ever
since
.
It
is
,
however
,
a
disarming
disguise
,
or
perhaps
a
shield
,
for
not_only
has
Mercer
proved
himself
to
be
one
of
the
few
great
lyricists
over
the
years
,
but
also
one
who
can
function
remarkably
under
pressure
.
He
has
also
enjoyed
a
successful
career
as
an
entertainer
(
his
records
have
sold
in
the
millions
)
and
is
a
sharp
businessman
.
He
has
also
an
extraordinary
conscience
.
In
1927
his
father
's
business
collapsed
,
and
,
rather_than
go
bankrupt
,
Mercer
senior
turned
his
firm
over
to
a
bank
for
liquidation
.
He
died
before
he
could
completely
pay_off
his
debts
.
Some
years
later
the
bank
handling
the
Mercer
liquidation
received
a
check
for
$
300000
,
enough
to
clear_up
the
debt
.
The
check
had
been
mailed
from
Chicago
,
the
envelope
bore
no
return_address
,
and
the
check
was
not
signed
.
``
That
's
Johnny
''
,
sighed
the
bank
president
,
``
the
best
hearted
boy
in
the
world
,
but
absent-minded
''
.
But
Mercer
's
explanation
was
simple
:
``
I
made_out
the
check
and
carried
it
around
a_few
days
unsigned
-
in_case
I
lost
it
''
.
When
he
remembered
that
he
might
have
not
signed
the
check
,
Mercer
made_out
another
for
the
same
amount
,
instructing
the
bank
to
destroy
the
other
-
especially
if
he
had
happened_to
have
absent-mindedly
signed
both
of
them
.
When
the
family
business
failed
,
Mercer
left
school
and
on
his
mother
's
urging
-
for
she
hoped
that
he
would
become
an
actor
-
he
joined
a
local
little
theater
group
.
When
the
troupe
traveled_to
New_York
to
participate
in
a
one
act
play
competition
-
and
won
-
Mercer
,
instead
of
returning
with
the
rest
of
the
company
in
triumph
,
remained
in
New_York
.
He
had
talked
one
other
member
of
the
group
to
stay
with
him
,
but
that
friend
had
tired
of
not
eating
regularly
and
returned
to
Savannah
.
But
Mercer
hung_on
,
living
,
after_a_fashion
,
in
a
Greenwich_Village
fourth
flight
walk-up
.
``
The
place
had
no
sink
or
washbasin
,
only
a
bathtub
''
,
his
mother
discovered
when
she
visited
him
.
``
Johnny
insisted
on
cooking
a
chicken
dinner
in
my
honor
-
he
's
always
been
a
good
cook
-
and
I
'll
never
forget
him
cleaning
the
chicken
in
the
tub
''
.
A
story
,
no_doubt
apocryphal
,
for
Mercer
himself
denies
it
,
has
him
sporting
a
monocle
in
those
Village
days
.
Though
merely
clear
glass
,
it
was
a
distinctive
trade_mark
for
an
aspiring
actor
who
hoped
to
imprint
himself
upon
the
memories
of
producers
.
One
day
in
a
bar
,
so
the
legend
goes
,
someone
put
a
beer
stein
with
too
much
force
on
the
monocle
and
broke
it
.
The
innocent
malfeasant
,
filled
with
that
supreme
sense
of
honor
found
in
bars
,
insisted
upon
replacing
the
destroyed
monocle
-
and
did
,
over
the
protests
of
the
former
owner
-
with
a
square
monocle
.
Mercer
is_supposed_to
have
refused
it
with
,
``
Anyone
who
wears
a
square
monocle
must
be
affected
''
!
Everett_Miller
,
then
assistant
director
for
the
Garrick_Gaieties
,
a
Theatre_Guild
production
,
needed
a
lyricist
for
a
song
he
had
written
;
he
just
happened
not
to
need
any
actor
at
the
moment
,
however
.
For
him
Mercer
produced
the
lyric
to
``
Out_of_Breath_Scared_to_Death_of_You
''
,
introduced
in
that
most
successful
of
all
the
Gaieties
,
by
Sterling_Holloway
.
This
1930
edition
also
had
songs
in
it
by
Vernon_Duke
and
Ira_Gershwin
,
by
E._Y._Harburg
and
Duke
,
and
by
Harry_Myers
.
Entrance
into
such
stellar
song
writing
company
encouraged
the
burgeoning
song_writer
to
take
a
wife
,
Elizabeth_Meehan
,
a
dancer
in
the
Gaieties
.
The
Mercers
took_up
residence
in
Brooklyn
,
and
Mercer
found
a
regular
job
in
Wall_Street
``
misplacing
stocks
and
bonds
''
.
When
he
heard
that
Paul_Whiteman
was
looking_for
singers
to
replace
the
Rhythm_Boys
,
Mercer
applied
and
got
the
job
,
``
not
for
my
voice
,
I
'm
sure
,
but
because
I
could
write
songs
and
material
generally
''
.
While
with
the
Whiteman
band
Mercer
met
Jerry_Arlen
.
He
had
yet
to
meet
Harold_Arlen
,
for
although
they
had
``
collaborated
''
on
``
Satan
's
Li
'
l
Lamb
''
,
Mercer
and
Harburg
had
worked
from
a
lead_sheet
the
composer
had
furnished
them
.
The
lyric
,
Mercer
remembers
,
was
tailored
to
fit
the
unusual
melody
.
Mercer
's
Whiteman
association
brought
him
into
contact
with
Hoagy_Carmichael
,
whose
``
Snowball
''
Mercer
relyriced
as
``
Lazybones
''
,
in
which
form
it
became
a
hit
and
marked
the
real
beginning
of
Mercer
's
song
writing
career
.
After
leaving
Whiteman
,
Mercer
joined
the
Benny_Goodman
band
as
a
vocalist
.
With
the
help
of
Ziggy_Elman
,
also
in
the
band
,
he
transformed
a
traditional
Jewish
melody
into
a
popular
song
,
``
And_the_Angels_Sing
''
.
The
countrywide
success
of
``
Lazybones
''
and
``
And_the_Angels_Sing
''
could
only
lead
to
Hollywood
,
where
,
besides
Harold_Arlen
,
Mercer
collaborated
with
Harry_Warren
,
Jimmy_Van_Heusen
,
Richard_Whiting
,
Walter_Donaldson
,
Jerome_Kern
,
and
Arthur_Schwartz
.
Mercer
has
also
written
both
music
and
lyrics
for
several
songs
.
He
may
be
the
only
song_writer
ever
to
have
collaborated
with
a
secretary
of
the
U._S._Treasury
;
he
collaborated
on
a
song
with
William_Hartman_Woodin
,
who
was
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
,
1932
-
33
.
When
Johnny_Mercer
and
Harold_Arlen
began
their
collaboration
in
1940
,
Mercer
,
like
Arlen
,
had
several
substantial
film
songs
to
his
credit
,
among
them
``
Hooray_for_Hollywood
''
,
``
Ride
,
Tenderfoot
,
Ride
''
,
``
Have_You_Got_Any_Castles
,
Baby
?
''
,
and
``
Too_Marvelous_for_Words
''
(
all
with
Richard_Whiting
)
;
with
Harry_Warren
he
did
``
The_Girl_Friend_of_the_Whirling_Dervish
''
,
``
Jeepers
Creepers
''
,
and
``
You_Must_Have_Been_a_Beautiful_Baby
''
.
Mercer
's
lyrics
are
characterized
by
an
unerring
ear
for
rhythmic
nuances
,
a
puckish
sense_of_humor
expressed
in
language
with
a
colloquial
flair
.
Though
versatile
and
capable
of
turning_out
a
ballad
lyric
with
the
best
of
them
,
Mercer
's
forte
is
a
highly
polished
quasi
folk
wit
.
His
casual
,
dreamlike
working
methods
,
often
as
not
in_absentia
,
were
an
abrupt
change
from
Harburg
's
,
so
that
Arlen
had_to
adjust
again
to
another
approach
to
collaboration
.
There
were
times
that
he
worked
with
both
lyricists
simultaneously
.
Speaking
of
his
work
with
Johnny_Mercer
,
Arlen
says
,
``
Our
working
habits
were
strange
.
After
we
got
a
script
and
the
spots
for
the
songs
were
blocked_out
,
we
'd
get_together
for
an
hour
or_so
every_day
.
While
Johnny
made
himself
comfortable
on
the
couch
,
I
'd
play
the
tunes
for
him
.
He
has
a
wonderfully
retentive
memory
.
After
I
would
finish
playing
the
songs
,
he
'd
just
go_away
without
a
comment
.
I
would
n't
hear
from
him
for
a_couple_of
weeks
,
then
he
'd
come
around
with
the
completed
lyric
''
.
Arlen
is
one
of
the
few
(
possibly
the
only
)
composer
Mercer
has
been
able
to
work
with
so
closely
,
for
they
held
their
meetings
in
Arlen
's
study
.
``
Some
guys
bothered
me
''
,
Mercer
has
said
.
``
I
could
n't
write
with
them
in
the
same
room
with
me
,
but
I
could
with
Harold
.
He
is
probably
our
most
original
composer
;
he
often
uses
very
odd
rhythms
,
which
makes
it
difficult
,
and
challenging
,
for
the
lyric
writer
''
.
While
Arlen
and
Mercer
collaborated
on
Hot_Nocturne
,
Mercer
worked
also
with
Arthur_Schwartz
on
another
film
,
Navy_Blues
.
Arlen
,
too
,
worked_on
other
projects
at_the_same_time
with
old
friend
Ted_Koehler
.
Besides
doing
a
single
song
,
``
When_the_Sun_Comes_Out
''
,
they
worked_on
the
ambitious
Americanegro_Suite
,
for
voices
and
piano
,
as_well_as
songs
for
films
.
The
Americanegro_Suite
is
in_a_sense
an
extension
of
the
Cotton_Club
songs
in_that
it
is
a
collection
of
Negro
songs
,
not
for
a
night_club
,
but
for
the
concert
stage
.
The
work
had
its
beginning
in
1938
with
an
eight
bar
musical
strain
to
which
Koehler
set
the
words
``
There
'll
be
no
more
work
/
There
'll
be
no
more
worry
''
,
matching
the
spiritual
feeling
of
the
jot
.
This
grew_into
the
song
``
Big_Time_Comin
''
'
.
By
September
1940
the
suite
had
developed
into
a
collection
of
six
songs
,
``
four
spirituals
,
a
dream
,
and
a
lullaby
''
.
The
Negro
composer
Hall_Johnson
studied
the
Americanegro_Suite
and
said
of
it
,
``
Of
all
the
many
songs
written
by
white
composers
and
employing
what
claims
to
be
a
Negroid
idiom
in
both
words
and
music
,
these
six
songs
by
Harold_Arlen
and
Ted_Koehler
easily
stand
far
out
above
the
rest
.
Thoroughly
modern
in
treatment
,
they
are
at_the_same_time
,
full
of
simple
sincerity
which
invariably
characterizes
genuine
Negro
folk-music
and
are
by_no_means
to
be
confused
with
the
average
'
Broadway
Spirituals
'
which
depend
for
their
racial
flavor
upon
sundry
allusions
to
the
'
Amen_Corner
'
,
'
judgement_day
'
,
'
Gabriel
's
horn
'
,
and
a
frustrated
devil
-
with
a_few
random
'
Hallelujahs
'
thrown_in
for_good_measure
.
