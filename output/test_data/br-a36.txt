Sen._John._McClellan
of
Arkansas
and
Rep._David_Martin
of
Nebraska
are
again
beating
the
drums
to
place
the
unions
under
the
anti-monopoly
laws
.
Once_more
the
fallacious
equation
is
advanced
to
argue
that
since
business
is
restricted
under
the
anti-monopoly
laws
,
there
must
be
a
corresponding
restriction
against
labor_unions
:
the
law
must
treat
everybody
equally
.
Or
,
in
the
words
of
Anatole_France
,
``
The
law
in
its
majestic
equality
must
forbid
the
rich
,
as_well
as
the
poor
,
from
begging
in
the
streets
and
sleeping
under
bridges
''
.
The
public
atmosphere
that
has
been
generated
which
makes
acceptance
of_this
law
a
possibility
stems
from
the
disrepute
into
which
the
labor_movement
has
fallen
as
a
result
of
Mr._McClellan
's
hearings
into
corruption
in
labor-management
relations
and
,
later
,
into
the
jurisdictional
squabbles
that
plagued
industrial
relations
at
the
missile
sites
.
The
Senator
was
shocked
by
stoppages
over
allegedly
trivial
disputes
that
delayed
our
missile
program
.
In_addition
,
disclosures
that
missile
workers
were
earning
sums
far
in_excess
of_what
is
paid
for
equivalent
work
elsewhere
provoked
his
indignation
on
behalf
of
the
American
taxpayer
who
was
footing
the
bill
.
It
is
now
disclosed
that
the
taxpayer
not_only
pays
for
high
wages
,
but
he
pays
the
employers
'
strike
expenses
when
the
latter
undertakes
to
fight
a
strike
.
Business_Week
(
Aug.
9
,
1961
)
reports
that
the
United_Aircraft_Company
,
against
which
the
International_Association
of
Machinists
had
undertaken
a
strike
,
decided
to
keep
its
plants
operating
.
The
company
incurred
some
$
10
million
of
expenses
attributable
to
four
factors
:
advertising
to
attract
new
employees
,
hiring
and
training
them
,
extra
overtime
,
and
defective
work
performed
by
the
new
workers
.
The
company
has
billed
the
United_States_Government
for
$
7500000
of
these
expenses
under
the
Defense_Department
regulation
allowing
costs
of
a
type
generally
recognized
as
ordinary
and
necessary
for
the
conduct
of
the
contractor
's
business
.
Rep._Frank_Kowalski
of
Connecticut
has
brought
this
problem
to
the
attention
of
the
Armed_Services
Committee
.
The
committee
remains
unresponsive
.
Neither
has
Congressman_Martin
nor
Senator_McClellan
been
heard
from
on
the_matter
;
they
are
preoccupied
with
ending
labor
abuses
by
extending
the
anti-monopoly
laws
to
the
unions
.
THE
RECENT
publicity
attending
the
successful
federal
prosecution
of
a
conspiracy
indictment
against
a_number_of
electrical
manufacturers
has
evoked
a
new
respect
for
the
anti-trust
laws
that_is
justified
neither
by
their
rationale
nor
by
the
results
they
have
obtained
.
The
anti-trust
laws
inform
a
business
that
it
must
compete
,
but
along
completely
undefined
lines
;
it
must
play
a
game
in_which
there
never
is
a
winner
.
The
fact
is
that
any
business
that
wants
to
operate
successfully
cannot
follow
the
law
.
Hypocrisy
thus
becomes
the
answer
to
a
foolish
public
policy
.
Let
us
look_at
the
heavy-electrical-goods
industry
in_which
General_Electric
,
Westinghouse
and
a_number_of
other
manufacturers
were
recently
convicted
of
engaging
in
a
conspiracy
to
rig
prices
and
allocate
the
market
.
The
industry
is
so
structured
that
price-setting
by
a
multi-product
company
will
vary
with
the
way
overhead
charges
are
allocated
-
whether
marginal
or
average
pricing
is
applied
.
The
problem
becomes
even
more
complex
where
an
enterprise
is
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
a
wide
variety
of
other
goods
in_addition
to
the
heavy
electrical
equipment
.
Accounting
procedures
can
be
varied
to
provide
a
rationale
for
almost
any
price
.
Naturally
,
enterprises
of
the
size
of
General_Electric
are
in
a
position
to
structure
their
prices
in_such_a_way
that
the
relatively
small
competitors
can
be
forced
to
the
wall
in
a
very
short_time
.
Should
these
giants
really
flex
their
competitive
muscles
,
they
would
become
the
only
survivors
in
the
industry
.
Uncle_Sam
would
then
accuse
them
of
creating
a
monopoly
by
``
unfair
competition
''
.
But
if
they
show
self-restraint
,
they
do
n't
get
the
orders
.
Under_the_circumstances
,
the
only
protection
for
the
relatively
small
manufacturers
is
to
engage
in
exactly
the
kind_of
conspiracy
with
the
giants
for
which
the
latter
were
convicted
.
Engaging
in
such
a
conspiracy
was
an
act
of
mercy
by
the
giants
.
The
paradox
implicit_in
the
whole
affair
is
shown
by
the
demand
of
the
government
,
after
the
conviction
,
that
General_Electric
sign
a
wide-open
consent
decree
that
it
would
not
reduce
prices
so
low
as
to
compete
seriously
with
its
fellows
.
In_other_words
,
the
anti-trust
laws
,
designed
to
reduce
prices
to
the
consumer
on
Monday
,
Wednesday
and
Friday
,
become
a
tool
to
protect
the
marginal
manufacturer
on
Tuesday
,
Thursday
and
Saturday
.
And
which
theory
would
govern
the
enforcers
of
the
law
on
Sunday
?
The
question
might
be
asked
:
``
Do
n't
the
managements
of
the
heavy-electrical-goods
manufacturers
know
these
facts
?
Why
did
they
engage
in
a
flood
of
mea
culpas
,
throw
a_few
scapegoats
to
the
dogs
and
promise
to
be
good
boys
thereafter
,
expressing
their
complete
confidence
in
the
laws
''
?
The
past
usefulness
of
the
anti-trust
laws
to
management
was
explained
by
Thurman_Arnold
,
in
The
Folklore
of
Capitalism
,
back
in
1937
.
He
wrote
:
``
the
anti-trust
laws
were
the
answer
of
a
society
which
unconsciously
felt
the
need
of
great
organizations
,
and
at_the_same_time
had
to
deny
them
a
place
in
the
moral
and
logical
ideology
of
the
social_structure
.
Anti-trust
laws
became
the
greatest
protection
to
uncontrolled
business
dictatorship
.
When
corporate
abuses
were
attacked
,
it
was
done
on
the
theory
that
criminal
penalties
would
be
invoked
rather_than
control
.
In_this
manner
,
every
scheme
for
direct
control
broke
to_pieces
on
the
great
protective
rock
of
the
anti-trust
laws
.
In_any_event
,
it
is
obvious
that
the
anti-trust
laws
did
not
prevent
the
formation
of
some
of
the
greatest
financial
empires
the
world
has
ever
known
,
held
together
by
some
of
the_most
fantastic
ideas
,
all
based
on
the
fundamental
notion
that
a
corporation
is
an
individual
who
can
trade
and
exchange
goods
without
control
by
the
government
''
.
This
escape
from
control
has
led
to
management
's
evaluating
the
risk
of
occasional
irrational
prosecution
as
worth
while
.
A
plea
of
nolo_contendere
,
followed
by
a
nominal
fine
,
after_all
is
a
small
price
to
pay
for
this
untrammeled
license
.
(
The
penalties
handed_out
in
the
electrical
case
,
which
included
jail
sentences
,
were
unprecedented
in
anti-trust
prosecutions
,
perhaps
because
the
conspirators
had
displayed
unusual
ineptness
in
their
pricing
activities
.
)
If
a
substitute
mechanism
is
needed
for
the
control
of
a
fictitious
impersonal
market
,
quite
obviously
some
method
must
be
devised
for
representing
the
public
interest
.
A
secret
conspiracy
of
manufacturers
is
hardly
such
a
vehicle
.
However
,
one
can
argue
that
no
such
control
is
necessary
as
long
as
one
pretends
that
the
anti-trust
laws
are
effective
and
rational
.
Quite
clearly
the
anti-trust
laws
are
neither
effective
nor
rational
-
and
yet
the
argument
goes
that
they
should
be
extended
to
the
labor_union
.
Those
who
favor
placing
trade_unions
under
anti-trust
laws
imply
that
they
are
advocating
a
brand
new
reform
.
Before
1933
,
individuals
who
opposed
trade_unions
and
collective_bargaining
said
so
in
plain
English
.
The
acceptance
of
collective_bargaining
as
a
national
policy
in
1934
,
implicit_in
the
writing
of
Section
7
A
of
the
National_Industrial_Recovery_Act
,
has
made
it
impolitic
to
oppose
collective_bargaining
in_principle
.
The
Wagner_Act
,
the
Taft-Hartley_Act
and
the
Landrum-Griffin_Act
all
endorse
the
principle
of
collective_bargaining
.
The
basic
purpose
of
an
effective
collective-bargaining
system
is
the
removal
of
wages
from
competition
.
If
a
union
cannot
perform
this
function
,
then
collective_bargaining
is
being
palmed_off
by
organizers
as
a
gigantic
fraud
.
The
tortured
reasoning
that
unions
use
to
deny
their
ambition
to
exercise
monopoly
power
over
the
supply
and
price
of
labor
is
one
of
the
things
that
create
a
legal_profession
.
The
problem
must
be
faced
squarely
.
If
laborers
are
merely
commodities
competing
against
each
other
in
a
market
place
like
so
many
bags
of
wheat
and
corn
(
unsupported
,
by_the_way
,
by
any
agricultural
subsidy
)
,
then
they
may
be
pardoned
for
reacting
with
complete
antagonism
to
a
system
that
imposes
such
status
upon
them
.
Human
labor
was
exactly
that
-
a
commodity
-
in
eighteenth
-
and
nineteenth-century
America
.
As
early
as
1776
,
Adam_Smith
wrote
in
The
Wealth
of
Nations
:
``
We
have
no
acts
of
Parliament
against
combining
to
lower
the
price
of
work
;
but
many
against
combining
to
raise
it
''
.
Eighteenth-century
England
,
upon
whose
customs
our
common_law
was
built
,
had
outlawed
unions
as
monopolies
and
conspiracies
.
In
1825
,
the
Boston
house
carpenters
'
strike
for
a
ten-hour
day
was
denounced
by
the
organized
employers
,
who
declared
:
``
It
is
considered
that
all
combinations
by
any
classes
of
citizens
intended
to
effect
the
value
of
labor
tend
to
convert
all
its
branches
into
monopolies
''
.
There
were
no
pious
hypocrisies
then
about
being
for
collective_bargaining
,
but
against
labor
monopoly
.
The
courts
shared
the
opinion
of
the
employers
.
In
People
vs.
Fisher
,
Justice_Savage
of
the
New_York
Supreme_Court
declared
:
``
Without
any
officious
and
improper
interference
on
the
subject
,
the
price
of
labor
or
the
wages
of
mechanics
will
be
regulated
by
the
demand
for
the
manufactured
article
and
the
value
of_that
which
is
paid
for
it
;
but
the
right
does
not
exist
to
raise
the
wages
of
the
mechanic
by
any
forced
and
artificial
means
''
.
Compare
this
statement
of
a
nineteenth-century
judge
with
how
Congressman_Martin
,
according_to
the
Daily_Labor_Report
of
Sept.
19
,
1961
,
defends
the
necessity
of
enacting
anti-trust
legislation
in
the
field
of
labor
``
if
we
wish
to
prevent
monopolistic
fixing
of
wages
,
production
or
prices
and
if
we
wish
to
preserve
the
freedom
of
the
employer
and
his
employees
to
contract
on
wages
,
hours
and
conditions
of
employment
''
.
Senator_McClellan
is
proposing
the
application
of
anti-trust
measures
to
unions
in
transportation
.
His
bill
,
allegedly
aimed
at
Hoffa
,
would
amend
the
Sherman
,
Clayton
and
Norris-LaGuardia
acts
to
authorize
the
issuance
of
federal
injunctions
in
any
transportation
strike
and
would
make
it
illegal
for
any
union
to
act
in_concert
with
any
other
union
-
even
a
sister
local
in
the
same
international
.
Paradoxically
,
the
same
week
in_which
Senator_McClellan
was
attempting
to
extend
the
anti-trust
act
to
labor
in
transportation
,
the
Civil_Aeronautics_Board
was
assuring
the
airlines
that
if
they
met
in_concert
to
eliminate
many
costly
features
of
air_travel
,
the
action
would
not
be
deemed
a
violation
of
the
anti-trust
act
.
Indeed
,
it
is
in
the
field
of
transportation
that
Congress
has
most
frequently
granted
employers
exemption
from
the
anti-trust
laws
;
for_example
,
the
organization
of
steamship
conferences
to
set
freight_rates
and
the
encouragement
of
railroads
to
seek
mergers
.
At
the
very
moment
that
every
attempt
is
being
made
to
take
management
out
from
under
the
irrationality
of
anti-trust
legislation
,
a
drive
is
on
to
abolish
collective_bargaining
under
the
guise
of
extending
the
anti-monopoly
laws
to
unions
who
want
no_more_than
to
continue
to
set
wages
in
the
same
way
that
ship
operators
set
freight_rates
.
The
passage
of
the
Sherman_Act
was
aimed
at
giant
monopolies
.
It
was
most
effective
against
trade_unions
.
In
the
famous
Danbury_Hatters
case
,
a
suit
was
brought
against
the
union
by
the
Loewe_Company
for
monopolistic
practices
,
e._g.
,
trying
to
persuade
consumers
not
to
purchase
the
product
of
the
struck
manufacturer
.
The
suit
against
the
union
was
successful
and
many
workers
lost
their
homes
to
pay_off
the
judgment
.
In
1914
,
the
Clayton_Act
attempted
to
take
labor
out
from
under
the
anti-trust
legislation
by
stating
that
human
labor
was
not
to
be
considered
a
commodity
.
The
law
could
not
suspend
economics
.
Labor
remained
a
commodity
-
but
presumably
a
privileged
one
granted
immunization
from
the
anti-trust
laws
.
The
courts
,
by
interpretation
,
emasculated
the
act
.
In
1922
,
the
United_Mine
Workers
struck
the
Coronado_Coal_Company
.
The
company
sued
under
the
anti-trust
laws
,
alleging
that
the
union
's
activity
interfered
with
the
movement
of
interstate
commerce
.
(
What
other
purpose
could
a
striking
union
have
but
to
interrupt
the
flow
of
commerce
from
the
struck
enterprise
?
)
The
court
first
ruled
that
the
strike
constituted
only
an
indirect
interference
with
commerce
.
