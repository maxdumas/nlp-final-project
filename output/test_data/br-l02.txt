I
was
giving
the
parked
cars
the
once-over
.
The
Oldsmobile
with
the
license_number
JYJ
114
was
in
stall
number
five
.
``
Okay
''
,
I
said
to
the
attendant
,
``
I
'll
let
you
know
if
I
close
the
deal
on
the
office
in_this
building
''
.
I
walked
with
him
back
to
the
entrance
.
He
gave
me
a
ticket
on
the
agency
car
and
parked
it
.
I
was
back
in
ten
minutes
.
``
Forgot
to
get
something
out
of
the
car
''
,
I
told
him
,
showing
him
my
ticket
.
He
started
to
say
something
as
I
walked
in
and_then
suddenly
grinned
and
said
,
``
Oh
,
yes
.
You
're
the
one
I
was
talking
to
about
a
monthly
rental
.
``
That
's
right
''
,
I
told
him
.
He
consulted
the
parking_ticket
,
then
looked
at
a
notation
and
said
,
``
You
're
in
the
third
row
back
toward_the_rear
.
Can
you
find
it
all_right
''
?
``
Sure
''
,
I
told
him
.
I
went_back
to
the
agency
car
and
got_out
an
electric
bug
,
one
of
the
newest
devices
for
electronic
shadowing
.
I
always
keep
a
set
in
the
car
.
I
put_in
new
batteries
so_as_to
be
certain
I
'd
have
plenty
of
power
and
on
my
way_out
walked
over
to
the
regular
parking
stalls
and
stood
looking
at
them
thoughtfully
.
I
waited
until
the
parking
attendant
was
busy
with
a
customer
,
then
slipped
around
the
back
of
the
car
with
license_number
JYM
114
,
attached
the
electronic
bug
to_the_rear
bumper
and
walked_out
.
The
attendant
waved
me
on
.
One
of
the
hardest
chores
a
detective
has
is
hanging_around
on
a
city
street
,
trying
to
make
himself
inconspicuous
,
keeping_an_eye_on
the
entrance
of
an
office_building
and
waiting
.
For
the
first
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
it
's
possible
to
be
more_or_less
interested
in
window
displays
,
then
in
people
passing_by
.
After
a
while
,
however
,
a
person
's
mind
gets
fed_up
and
that
magnifies
all_of
the
disagreeable
physical
symptoms
which
go_with
that
sort_of
an
assignment
.
You
want
to
sit_down
.
Your
leg
muscles
and
back
muscles
feel
weary
.
You
're
conscious_of
the
fact
that
your
feet
hurt
,
that
the
city
pavements
are
hard
.
I
waited
a
solid
two
hours
before
my
man
came_out
of
the
office_building
.
He
came_out
alone
.
I
was
n't
far
behind
him
when
he
entered
the
parking_lot
and
hurried
over
to
his
car
.
The
attendant
recognized
me
once_more
and
said
,
``
What
did
you
do
about
that
office
''
?
``
I
have
n't
made_up
my
mind
yet
''
,
I
said
.
``
It
's
a
sublease
.
I
have
a_couple_of
them
I
'm
figuring
on
;
one
here
and
one
that
's
out
quite
a
ways
where
there
's
usually
curb
parking
''
.
``
That
curb
parking
is
undependable
and
annoying
,
particularly
when
it
rains
''
,
he
said
.
I
kept
trying
to
get
him
to
take
my
money
.
``
Okay
''
,
I
told
him
.
``
I
'm
in
a
rush
right_now
.
I
know
where
the
car
is
.
Want
me
to
drive
it
out
''
?
``
I
'll
have
one
of
the
boys
get
it
''
,
he
said
.
``
It
's
one
of
the
rules
on
transients
.
Regulars
drive
out
their
own
cars
''
.
``
Make
it
as
snappy
as
you
can
,
will
you
''
?
I
asked
.
``
Oh
,
that
's
all_right
''
,
he
said
.
``
You
're
going_to
be
a
regular
.
You
'll
get_in
the
office_building
here
.
You
do
n't
want
to
lease
a
place
way_out
in
the
sticks
.
You
get
business
where
the
business
is
,
not
where
it
is
n't
''
.
I
grinned
at
him
,
handed
him
a_couple_of
dollars
and
said
,
``
By
the
time
you
get
the
parking
charge
figured
up
,
there
should
be
a
cigar
in
it
for
you
''
.
I
hurried
over
to
the
agency
heap
,
jumped
in
,
started
the
motor
and
was
just_in_time
to
see
the
car
I
wanted
to
shadow
turn
to
the
left
.
I
was
held_up
a_bit
trying
to
make
a
left
turn
.
By
the
time
I
'd
made
it
he
was
gone
.
Traffic
was
pretty
heavy
.
I
turned_on
the
electric
bug
,
and
the
signal
came_in
loud
and
clear
.
I
made
time
and
picked
him
up
within
ten
blocks
.
I
stayed
half
a
block
behind
him
,
letting
lots_of
cars
keep
in
between
us
,
listening
to
the
steady
beep
beep
beep
.
After
fifteen
minutes
of
traffic
driving
he
turned
to
the
left
.
I
could
n't
see
him
,
but
the
electric
bugging
device
gave
steady
beeps
when
it
was
straight
ahead
,
short
half
beeps
when
the
car
I
was
following
was
to
the
left
,
and
long
drawn-out
beeps
when
it
turned
to
the
right
.
If
it
ever
got
behind
me
,
the
beep
turned
to
a
buzz
.
I
turned
left
too_soon
and
got
a
signal
showing
that
I
was
still
behind
him
but
he
was
to
the
right
.
After
a
while
the
signal
became
a
buzz
and
I
knew
he
was
behind
me
.
That
meant
he
'd
parked
someplace
.
I
made
a
big
circle
until
I
located
the
car
parked
at
the
curb
in_front
of
an
apartment
house
.
I
found
a
parking
place
half
a
block
away
,
sat
in
the
car
and
waited
.
My
quarry
was
in
the
apartment
house
for
two
hours
.
Then
he
came_out
and
started
driving
toward
the
beach
.
By
this
time
it
was
dark
.
I
could
get
up
close_to
him
where
there
was
traffic
but
had
to
drop
far
behind
when
there
was
n't
traffic
.
My
lights
would
have
been
a
giveaway
if
I
'd
tried
to
shadow
him
in
the
conventional
manner
.
Moreover
,
I
'd
have
lost
him
if
it
had
n't
been
for
the
electronic
shadowing
device
.
His
signal
was
coming
loud
and
clear
and_then
all_of_a_sudden
it
turned
to
a
buzz
.
I
circled
the
block
and
found
he
was
in
the
parking_lot
of
a
high-class
restaurant
.
I
sat
where
I
could
watch
the
exit
and
realized
I
was
hungry
.
I
sat
there
with
the
faint
odor
of
charcoal-broiled
steaks
tantalizing
my
nostrils
and
occasionally
catching
the
aroma
of
coffee
.
My
man
came_out
an
hour
later
,
drove
to
the
beach
,
turned
right
and
after
half
a
mile
went
to
the
Swim
and
Tan_Motel
.
It
was
a
fairly
modern
motel
with
quite
a_bit
of
electrical
display
in_front
.
I
remembered
it
was
the
Peeping_Tom
place
.
I
waited
until
my
man
was
coming_out
of
the
office
with
the
key
to
a
cabin
before
I
went_in
to
register
.
The
card
the
man
I
was
shadowing
had
filled_out
was
still
on
the
counter
.
I
noticed
that
he
was
in
Unit
12
and
that
he
had
registered
under
the
name
of
Oscar_L._Palmer
and
wife
,
giving
a
San_Francisco
address
.
He
had
written
out
the
license_number
of
his
car
but
had
transposed
the
last
two
figures
,
an
old
dodge
which
is
still
good
.
Ninety-nine
times_out
of
a_hundred
the
motel
manager
does
n't
check
the
license_number
on
the
plates
against
the
license_number
the
tenant
writes
out
.
If
he
does
,
it
's
still
better
than
an
even_chance
he
won
n't
notice
the
transposition
of
the
numbers
,
and
if
he
should
notice
it
,
the
thing
can
be
passed_off
as
an
honest
mistake
.
I
used
the
alias
of
Robert_C._Richards
,
gave
the
first
three
letters
and
the
first_and_last
figure
of
the
license_number
on
the
agency
heap
,
but
a_couple_of
phony
numbers
in_between
.
I
could
have
written
anything
.
The
manager
of
the
motel
was
a
woman
who
apparently
did
n't
care
.
She
was
complying
with
the
law
in
regard_to
registrations
but
she
certainly
was
n't
checking
license_numbers
or
bothering
the
tenants
.
``
You
mean
you
're
all
alone
,
Mr._Richards
''
?
``
That
's
right
''
.
``
Your
wife
is
n't
going_to
join
you
-
later
''
?
``
I
do
n't
think
so
''
.
``
If
you
expect
her
to
show_up
''
,
she
said
,
``
you
'd
better
put
'
and
wife
'
on
there
.
It
's
a
formality
,
you
know
''
.
``
Any
difference
in
the
rate
''
?
I
asked
.
``
Not
to
you
''
,
she
said
smiling
.
``
It
's
ten
dollars
either
way
.
There
are
ice_cubes
in
a
container
at
the
far
end
and
in
another
by
the
office
.
There
are
three
soft-drink
vending_machines
,
and
if
you
should
be
joined
by
-
anybody
-
try
to
keep
things
quiet
,
if
you
will
.
We
like
to
run
a
nice
quiet
place
''
.
``
Thank_you
''
,
I
told
her
.
I
took
another
sidelong
glance
at
the
other
registration
card
,
then
took
the
key
to
Unit
13
that
she
had
given
me
and
went_down
long
enough
to
park
the
car
.
The
construction
was
reasonably
solid
;
not
like
the
cracker-box
construction
of
so
many_of
the
motel
units
that
have
stucco
all_over
the
outside
but
walls
that
are
thin
enough
so
you
can
hear
every
movement
of
the
people
in
the
adjoining
apartment
.
I
put
a
small
electric
amplifier
against
the
wall
on_the_side
I
wanted
to
case
.
With
the
aid
of_that
I
could
hear
my
man
moving
around
,
heard
him
cough
a_couple_of
times
,
heard
the
toilet
flush
,
heard
the
sound
of
water
running
.
Whoever
his
companion
was
going_to
be
,
she
was
going_to
join
him
later
.
She
knew
where
to
come
.
He
did
n't
have_to
telephone
.
I
was
so
hungry
my
stomach
felt
all
lines
of
communication
had
been
severed
.
It
's
one
thing
to
go
without
food
when
you
're
occupied
with
some
work
or
when
you
're
simply
postponing
a
meal
,
but
when
you
're
dependent_on
someone
else
and
know
that
you
can
n't
eat
until
he
's
bedded_down
for
the
night
,
hunger
can
be
a
gnawing
torture
.
I
had
noticed
a
drive-in
down
the
road
a
quarter
of
a
mile
.
The
batteries
on
the
bugging
device
I
had
put
on
the
car
were
still
fresh
enough
to
send_out
good
strong
signals
.
The
powerful
microphone
I
could
press
against
the
wall
between
my
motel
unit
and
that
occupied
by
the
man
would
bring_in
the
sound
of
any
conversation
,
and
I
was
positively
nauseated
I
was
so
hungry
.
I
got_in
the
car
,
drove
down
to
the
drive-in
and
ordered
a_couple_of
hamburgers
with
everything_included
,
a
cup
of
coffee
and
the
fastest
service
possible
.
The
place
was
n't
particularly
busy
at_that_time
of
night
,
and
the
girl
who
was
waiting
on
me
,
who
was
clothed
in
the
tightest-fitting
pair
of
slacks
I
had
ever
seen
on
a
woman
and
a
sweater
that
showed
everything
there
was
-
and
there
was
lots_of
it
-
wanted
to
be
sociable
.
``
You
really
in
a
hurry
,
Handsome
''
?
she
asked
.
``
I
'm
in
a
hurry
,
Beautiful
''
.
``
It
's
early
in
the
evening
to
be
in
a
hurry
.
There
's
lots_of
time
left
''
.
``
There
may
not
be
any
women
left
''
,
I
said
.
She
gave
a_little
pout
and
said
,
``
I
do
n't
get_off
work
until
eleven
o
'
clock
.
That
's
when
my
evening
commences
''
.
``
I
'll
be
here
at
ten-fifty-five
''
,
I
said
.
``
Oh
,
you
!
''
she
announced
.
``
That
's
what
they
all
say
.
What
's
that
thing
going
buzz-buzz-buzz
in
your
car
''
?
I
said
``
Darn
it
,
that
's
the
automatic
signal
that
shows
when
the
ignition_key
is
on
.
I
did
n't
turn
it
off
''
.
I
reached
over
and
switched_off
the
electronic
bugging
device
.
She
went_in
to
get
the
hamburgers
,
and
I
switched_on
the
device
again
and
kept
the
signal
from
Dowling
's
car
coming_in
steady
and
clear
until
I
saw
her
starting
back
with
the
hamburgers
.
Then
I
shut_off
the
device
again
.
She
wanted
to
hang_around
while
I
was
eating
.
``
Do
n't
you
think
it
's
selfish
to
have
dinner
before
you
go
to
pick
her
up
''
?
``
No
''
,
I
said
.
``
It
's
a
kindness
to
her
.
You
see
,
she
's
on
a
diet
.
She
'll
eat
just
a
pineapple
and
cottage_cheese
salad
and
I
'm
to
have
one
with
her
so
she
won
n't
feel
out
of
place
''
.
``
diets
can
be
terrible
''
,
the
girl
said
.
``
How
much
overweight
is
she
''
?
``
Not
a_bit
''
,
I
said
,
``
but
she
's
keeping
her
figure
in_hand
''
.
She
looked
at
me
provocatively
.
``
Good
figures
should
be
kept
in_hand
''
,
she
said
,
and
walked
away
with
an
exaggerated
wiggle
.
I
turned_on
the
device
again
,
half
fearful
that
I
might
find
silence
,
but
the
buzzes
came_in
loud
and
clear
.
When
I
switched_on
the
lights
for
her
to
come
and
get
the
check
,
I
had
the
exact
change
plus
a
dollar
tip
.
