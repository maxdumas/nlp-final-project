After
only
eighteen
years
of
non-interference
,
there
were
already
indications
of
melioration
,
though
``
in
a
slight
degree
''
,
to_be_sure
.
There
were
more
indications
by
the
mid
twentieth
century
.
I
leave
it
to
the
statisticians
to
say
what
they
were
,
but
I
noticed
several
a_few
years
ago
,
during
an
automobile
ride
from
Memphis
to
Hattiesburg
.
In
town
after
town
my
companion
pointed_out
the
Negro
school
and
the
White
school
,
and
in
every
instance
the
former
made
a
better
appearance
(
it
was
newer
,
for_one_thing
)
.
It
really
looked
as
if
a
change
of
the
sort
predicted
by
Booker_T._Washington
had
been
going_on
.
But
with
the
renewal
of
interference
in
1954
(
as
with
its
beginning
in
1835
)
,
the
improvement
was
impaired
.
For
over
a_hundred
years
Southerners
have
felt
that
the
North
was
picking
on
them
.
It
's
infuriating
,
this
feeling
that
one
is
being
picked
on
,
continually
,
constantly
.
By
what
right
of
superior
virtue
,
Southerners
ask
,
do
the
people
of
the
North
do
this
?
The
traditional
strategy
of
the
South
has
been
to
expose
the
vices
of
the
North
,
to
demonstrate
that
the
North
possessed
no
superior
virtue
,
to
``
show
the
world
that
''
(
as
James
's
Christopher_Newman
said
to
his
adversaries
)
``
however
bad
I
may
be
,
you
're
not
quite
the
people
to
say
it
''
.
In
the
pre
Civil_War
years
,
the
South
argued
that
the
slave
was
not
less
humanely
treated
than
the
factory_worker
of
the
North
.
At
the
present_time
,
the
counter-attack
takes
the
line
that
there
's
no
more
of
the
true
spirit
of
``
integration
''
in
the
North
than
in
the
South
.
The
line
is
a
pretty
good
one
.
People
talk_about
``
the
law
of
the
land
''
.
The
expression
has
become
quite
a
cliche
.
But
people
can
n't
be
made
to
integrate
,
socialize
(
the
two
are
inseparable
by
Southern
standards
)
by
law
.
I
was
having
lunch
not_long
ago
(
apologies
to
N._V._Peale
)
with
three
distinguished
historians
(
one
specializing
in
the
European
Middle_Ages
,
one
in
American
history
,
and
one
in
the
Far_East
)
,
and
I
asked
them
if
they
could
name
instances
where
the
general
mores
had
been
radically
changed
with
``
deliberate
speed
,
majestic
instancy
''
(
Francis_Thompson
's
words
for
the
Hound_of_Heaven
's
pursuit
)
by
judicial
fiat
.
They
did
n't
seem
to
be
able
to
think_of
any
.
A
Virginia
judge
a
while
back
cited
a
Roman
jurist
to
the
effect
that
ten
years
might
be
a
reasonable
length
of
time
for
such
a
change
.
But
I
suspect
that
the
old
Roman
was
referring
to
change
made
under
military
occupation
-
the
sort
of
change
which
Tacitus
was
talking_about
when
he
said
,
``
They
make
a
desert
,
and
call
it
peace
''
(
``
Solitudinem
faciunt
,
pacem
appellant
''
.
)
.
Moreover
,
the
law
of
the
land
is
not
irrevocable
;
it
can
be
changed
;
it
has
been
,
many
times
.
Mr._Justice_Taney
's
Dred_Scott
decision
in
1857
was
unpopular
in
the
North
,
and
soon
became
a
dead_letter
.
Prohibition
was
the
law
of
the
land
,
but
it
was
unpopular
(
how
many
of
us
oldsters
took_up
drinking
in
prohibition
days
,
drinking
was
so
gay
,
so
fashionable
,
especially
in
the
sophisticated
Northeast
!
)
and
was
repealed
.
The
cliche
loses
its
talismanic
virtue
in
the
light
of
a_little
history
.
The
Declaration_of_Independence
says
that
``
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
''
.
The
phrase
``
consent
of
the
governed
''
needs
a
hard
look
.
How
do
we
define
it
?
Is
the
consent
of
the
governed
a
numerical
majority
?
Calhoun
dealt
with
this
question
in
his
``
Disquisition_on_Government
''
.
To
guard
against
the
tyranny
of
a
numerical
majority
,
Calhoun
developed
his
theory
of
``
concurrent
majority
''
,
which
,
he
said
,
``
by
giving
to
each
portion
of
the
community
which
may
be
unequally
affected
by
the
action
of
government
,
a
negative
on
the
others
,
prevents
all
partial
or
local
legislation
''
.
Who
will
say
that
our
country
is
even
now
a
homogeneous
community
?
that
regional
peculiarities
do
not
still
exist
?
that
the
Court_order
does
not
unequally
affect
the
Southern
region
?
Who
will
deny
that
in
a
vast
portion
of
the
South
the
Federal
action
is
incompatible
with
the
Jeffersonian
concept
of
``
the
consent
of
the
governed
''
?
Circumstances
alter
cases
.
A
friend
of
mine
in
New_Mexico
said
the
Court_order
had
caused
no
particular
trouble
out
there
,
that
all
had
gone
as
merry
as
a
marriage
bell
.
He
seemed
a_little
surprised
that
it
should
have
caused
any
particular
trouble
anywhere
.
I
murmured
something
about
a
possible
difference
between
New_Mexico
's
history
and
Mississippi
's
.
One
can
meet_with
aloofness
almost
anywhere
:
the
Thank-Heaven-We
're_-_not-Involved
viewpoint
,
It
Does
n't
Affect
Us
!
Southern
Liberals
(
there
are
a_good_many
)
-
especially
if
they
're
rich
-
often
exhibit
blithe
insouciance
.
The
trouble
here
is
that
it
's
almost
too
easy
to
take
the
high
moral
ground
when
it
does
n't
cost
you
anything
.
You
've
already
sent
your
daughter
to
Miss_X
's
select
academy
for
girls
and
your
son
to
Mr._Y
's
select
academy
for
boys
,
and
you
can
be
as
liberal
as
you
please
with
strict
impunity
.
If
there
's
no
suitable
academy
in
your
own
neighborhood
,
there
's
always
New_England
.
New_England
academies
welcome
fugitives
from
the
provinces
,
South
as_well_as
West
.
They
may
even
enroll
a
colored
student
or
two
for
show
,
though
he
usually
turns_out
to
be
from
Thailand
,
or
any
place
other_than
the
American
South
.
It
would
be
interesting
to
know
how
much
``
integration
''
there
is
in
the
famous
,
fashionable
colleges
and
prep_schools
of
New_England
.
A
recent
newspaper
report
said
there
were
five
Negroes
in
the
1960
graduating_class
of
nearly
one_thousand
at
Yale
;
that_is
,
about
one-half
of
one
per_cent
,
which
looks
pretty
``
tokenish
''
to
me
,
especially
in
an
institution
which
professes
to
be
``
national
''
.
I
must
confess
that
I
prefer
the
Liberal
who
is
personally
affected
,
who
is
willing
to
send
his
own
children
to
a
mixed
school
as
proof
of
his
faith
.
I
leave_out
of
account
the
question
of
the
best
interests
of
the
children
,
the
question
of
what
their
best
interests
really
are
.
I
'm
talking_about
the
grand
manner
of
the
Liberal
-
North
and
South
-
who
is
not
affected
personally
.
If
these
people
were
denied
a
voice
(
do
they
have
a
moral
right
to
a
voice
?
)
,
what
voices
would
be
left
?
Who
is
involved
willy_nilly
?
Well
,
after
everybody
has
followed
the
New_England
pattern
of
segregating
one
's
children
into
private_schools
,
only
the
poor
folks
are
left
.
And
it
is
precisely
in
this
poorer
economic
class
that
one
finds
,
and
has
always
found
,
the
most
racial
friction
.
A
dear
,
respected
friend
of
mine
,
who
like
myself
grew_up
in
the
South
and
has
spent
many
years
in
New_England
,
said
to
me
not_long
ago
:
``
I
can
n't
forgive
New_England
for
rejecting
all
complicity
''
.
Being
a
teacher
of
American
literature
,
I
remembered
Whittier
's
``
Massachusetts_to_Virginia
''
,
where
he
said
:
``
But
that
one
dark
loathsome
burden
ye
must
stagger
with
alone
,
And
reap
the
bitter
harvest
which
ye
yourselves
have
sown
''
.
There
is
a
legend
(
Hawthorne
records
it
in
his
``
English_Notebooks
''
.
and
one
finds
it
again
in
Thomas_Nelson_Page
)
to
the
effect
that
the
Mayflower
on
its
second
voyage
brought
a
cargo
of
Negro
slaves
.
Whether
historically
a
fact
or
not
,
the
legend
has
a
certain
symbolic
value
.
Complicity
is
an
embarrassing
word
.
It
is
something
which
most_of
us
try
to
get_out
from
under
.
Like
the
cowboy
in
Stephen_Crane
's
``
Blue_Hotel
''
,
we
run
around
crying
,
``
Well
,
I
did
n't
do
anything
,
did
I
''
?
Robert_Penn_Warren
puts
it
this
way
in
``
Brother_to_Dragons
''
:
``
The
recognition
of
complicity
is
the
beginning
of
innocence
''
,
where
innocence
,
I
think
,
means
about
the
same
thing
as
redemption
.
A
man
must
be
able
to
say
,
``
Father
,
I
have
sinned
''
,
or
there
is
no
hope
for
him
.
Lincoln
understood
this
better
than
most
when
he
said
in
his
``
Second
Inaugural
''
that
God
``
gives
to
both
North
and
South
this
terrible
war
,
as
the
woe
due
to
those
by
whom
the
offense
came
''
.
He
also
spoke_of
``
the
wealth
piled
by
the
bondsman
's
two_hundred_and_fifty
years
in
unrequited
toil
''
.
Lincoln
was
historian
and
economist
enough
to
know
that
a
substantial
portion
of
this
wealth
had
accumulated
in
the
hands
of
the
descendants
of
New_Englanders
engaged
in
the
slave_trade
.
After
how
many
generations
is
such
wealth
(
mounting
all
the
while
through
the
manipulations
of
high_finance
)
purified
of
taint
?
It
is
a
question
which
New_Englanders
long_ago
put
out
of
their
minds
.
But
did
n't
they
get_off
too
easy
?
The
slaves
never
shared
in
their
profits
,
while
they
did
share
,
in
a
very
real
sense
,
in
the
profits
of
the
slave
owners
:
they
were
fed
,
clothed
,
doctored
,
and_so_forth
;
they
were
the
beneficiaries
of
responsible
,
paternalistic
care
.
Emerson
-
Platonist
,
idealist
,
doctrinaire
-
sounded
a
high
Transcendental
note
in
his
``
Boston_Hymn
''
,
delivered
in
1863
in
the
Boston
Music_Hall
amidst
thundering
applause
:
``
Pay
ransom
to
the
owner
and
fill
the
bag
to
the
brim
.
Who
is
the
owner
?
The
slave
is
owner
,
And
ever
was
.
Pay
him
''
!
It
is
the
abstractionism
,
the
unrealism
,
of
the
pure
idealist
.
It
ignores
the
sordid
financial
aspects
(
quite
conveniently
,
too
,
for
his
audience
,
who
could
indulge
in
moral
indignation
without
visible
,
or
even
conscious
,
discomfort
,
their
money
from
the
transaction
having
been
put_away
long_ago
in
a
good
antiseptic
brokerage
)
.
Like
Pilate
,
they
had
washed_their_hands
.
But
can
one
,
really
?
Can
God
be
mocked
,
ever
,
in_the_long_run
?
New_Englanders
were
a_bit
sensitive
on
the
subject
of
their
complicity
in
Negro
slavery
at
the
time
of
the
drafting
of
the
Declaration_of_Independence
,
as
Jefferson
explained
in
his
``
Autobiography
''
:
``
The
clause
reprobating
the
enslaving
the
inhabitants
of
Africa
was
struck_out
in
complaisance
to
South_Carolina
and
Georgia
,
who
had
never
attempted
to
restrain
the
importation
of
slaves
,
and
who
on_the_contrary
still
wished
to
continue
it
.
Our
Northern
brethren
also
I
believe
felt
a_little
tender
under
those
censures
;
for
though
their
people
had
very
few
slaves
themselves
,
yet
they
had
been
pretty
considerable
carriers
of
them
to
others
''
.
But
that
was
a
long_time
ago
.
The
New_England
conscience
became
desensitized
.
George_W._Cable
(
naturalized
New_Englander
)
,
writing
in
1889
from
``
Paradise_Road
,
Northampton
''
(
lovely
symbolic
name
)
,
agitated
continuously
the
``
Southern
question
''
.
It
was
nice
to
be
able
to
isolate
it
.
New_England
,
as
everyone
knows
,
has
long
been
schoolmaster
to
the
Nation
.
There
one
finds
concentrated
in
a
comparatively
small
area
the
chief
universities
,
colleges
,
and
preparatory_schools
of
the
United_States
.
Why
should
this
be
so
?
It
is
true
that
New_England
,
more_than
any
other
section
,
was
dedicated
to
education
from
the
start
.
But
I
think
that
something
more
than
this
is
involved
.
How
did
it
happen
,
for_example
,
that
the
state
university
,
that
great
symbol
of
American
democracy
,
failed
to
flourish
in
New_England
as
it
did
in
other
parts
of
the
country
?
Is
n't
it
a_bit
odd
that
the
three
states
of
Southern
New_England
(
Massachusetts
,
Connecticut
,
and
Rhode_Island
)
have
had
state
institutions
of
university
status
only
in
the
very
recent
past
,
these
institutions
having
previously
been
A_+_M_colleges
?
Was
it
supposed
,
perchance
,
that
A_+_M
(
vocational_training
,
that_is
)
was
quite
sufficient
for
the
immigrant_class
which
flooded
that
part
of
the
New_England
world
in
the
post
Civil_War
period
,
the
immigrants
having
been
brought_in
from
Southern
Europe
,
to
work
in
the
mills
,
to
make_up
for
the
labor
shortage
caused
by
migration
to
the
West
?
Is
it
not
ironical
that
Roger_Williams
's
state
,
Rhode_Island
,
should
have
been
the
very
last
of
the
forty-eight
to
establish
a
state
university
?
The
state
universities
of
Maine
,
New_Hampshire
,
And
Vermont
are
older
and
more
``
respectable
''
;
they
had
less
immigration
to
contend
with
.
A
Yale
historian
,
writing
a_few
years
ago
in
The
Yale_Review
,
said
:
``
We
in
New_England
have
long_since
segregated
our
children
''
.
He
was
referring
not_only
to
the
general
college
situation
but
more
especially
to
the
preparatory_schools
.
And
what
a
galaxy
of
those
adorns
that
fair
land
!
I
do
n't
propose
to
go
into
their
history
,
but
I
have
one
or
two
surmises
.
One
is
that
they
were
established
,
or
gained
eminence
,
under
pressure
provided
by
these
same
immigrants
,
from
whom
the
old
families
wished
to
segregate
their
children
.
In
the
early_days
of
a
homogeneous
population
,
the
public_school
was
quite
satisfactory
.
