East_Providence
should
organize
its
civil_defense
setup
and
begin
by
appointing
a
full-time
director
,
Raymond_H._Hawksley
,
the
present
city
CD
head
,
believes
.
Mr._Hawksley
said
yesterday
he
would
be
willing
to
go
before
the
city_council
``
or
anyone
else
locally
''
to
outline
his
proposal
at
the
earliest
possible
time
.
East_Providence
now
has
no
civil_defense
program
.
Mr._Hawksley
,
the
state
's
general
treasurer
,
has
been
a
part-time
CD
director
in
the
city
for
the
last
nine
years
.
He
is
not
interested
in
being
named
a
full-time
director
.
Noting
that
President_Kennedy
has
handed
the
Defense_Department
the
major
responsibility
for
the
nation
's
civil_defense
program
,
Mr._Hawksley
said
the
federal_government
would
pay
half
the
salary
of
a
full-time
local
director
.
He
expressed
the
opinion
the
city
could
hire
a
CD
director
for
about
$
3500
a
year
and
would
only
have
to
put_up
half
that
amount
on
a
matching
fund
basis
to
defray
the
salary
costs
.
Mr._Hawksley
said
he
believed
there
are
a_number_of
qualified
city
residents
who
would
be
willing
to
take
the
full-time
CD
job
.
One
of
these
men
is
former
Fire_Chief
John_A._Laughlin
,
he
said
.
Along
with
a
director
,
the
city
should
provide
a
CD
headquarters
so_that
pertinent
information
about
the
local
organization
would
be
centralized
.
Mr._Hawksley
said
.
One
advantage
that
would
come
to
the
city
in
having
a
full-time
director
,
he
said
,
is
that
East_Providence
would
become
eligible
to
apply
to
the
federal_government
for
financial_aid
in
purchasing
equipment
needed
for
a
sound
civil_defense
program
.
Matching
funds
also
can
be
obtained
for
procurement
of
such
items
as
radios
,
sirens
and
rescue
trucks
,
he
said
.
Mr._Hawksley
believes
that
East_Providence
could
use
two
more
rescue
trucks
,
similar
to
the
CD
vehicle
obtained
several
years
ago
and
now
detailed
to
the
Central
Fire_Station
.
He
would
assign
one
of
the
rescue
trucks
to
the
Riverside
section
of
the
city
and
the
other
to
the
Rumford
area
.
Speaking
of
the
present
status
of
civil_defense
in
the
city
,
Mr._Hawksley
said
he
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
not
more_than
one
person
in
a_hundred
would
know
what
to
do
or
where
to
go
in
the
event
of
an
enemy
attack
.
The
Narragansett_Race_Track
grounds
is
one
assembly
point
,
he
said
,
and
a
drive-in
theater
in
Seekonk
would
be
another
.
Riverside
residents
would
go_to
the
Seekonk
assembly
point
.
Mr._Hawksley
said
he
was
not
critical
of
city
residents
for
not
knowing
what
to
do
or
where
to
assemble
in_case
of
an
air_attack
.
Such
vital
information
,
he
said
,
has
to
be
made
available
to
the
public
frequently
and
at
regular
intervals
for
residents
to
know
.
If
the
city_council
fails
to
consider
appointment
of
a
full-time
CD
director
,
Mr._Hawksley
said
,
then
he
plans
to
call
a
meeting
early
in
September
so_that
a
civil_defense
organization
will
be
developed
locally
.
One
of
the
first
things
he
would
do
,
he
said
,
would
be
to
organize
classes
in
first_aid
.
Other
steps
would
be
developed
after
information
drifts
down
to
the
local
level
from
the
federal_government
.
Rhode_Island
is
going
to
examine
its
Sunday
sales
law
with
possible
revisions
in
mind
.
Governor_Notte
said
last
night
he
plans
to
name
a
committee
to
make
the
study
and
come_up
with
recommendations
for
possible
changes
in_time
for
the
next
session
of
the
General_Assembly
.
The
governor
's
move
into
the
so-called
``
blue_law
''
controversy
came
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
Miss_Mary_R._Grant
,
deputy
city
clerk
of
Central_Falls
.
A
copy
was
released
to
the
press
.
Mr._Notte
was
responding
to
a
resolution
adopted
by
the
Central_Falls
City_Council
on
July
10
and
sent
to
the
state
house
by
Miss_Grant
.
The
resolution
urges
the
governor
to
have
a
complete
study
of
the
Sunday
sales
laws
made
with
an
eye
to
their
revision
at
the
next
session
of
the
legislature
.
While
the
city_council
suggested
that
the
Legislative_Council
might
perform
the
review
,
Mr._Notte
said
that
instead
he
will
take_up
the_matter
with
Atty._Gen._J._Joseph_Nugent
to
get
``
the
benefit
of
his
views
''
.
He
will
then
appoint
the
study
committee
with
Mr._Nugent
's
cooperation
,
the
governor
said
.
``
I
would
expect
the
proposed
committee
to
hold
public
hearings
''
,
Mr._Notte
said
,
``
to
obtain
the
views
of
the
general
public
and
religious
,
labor
and
special-interest
groups
affected
by
these
laws
''
.
The
governor
wrote
Miss_Grant
that
he
has
been
concerned
for_some_time
``
with
the
continuous
problem
which
confronts
our
local
and
state
law_enforcement
officers
as
a
result
of
the
laws
regulating
Sunday
sales
''
.
The
attorney_general
has
advised
local
police
that
it
is
their
duty
to
enforce
the_blue
laws
.
Should
there
be
evidence
they
are
shirking
,
he
has
said
,
the
state
police
will
step_into
the
situation
.
There
has
been
more
activity
across
the
state_line
in
Massachusetts
than
in
Rhode_Island
in
recent
weeks
toward
enforcement
of
the
Sunday
sales
laws
.
The
statutes
,
similar
in
both
the
Bay_State
and
Rhode_Island
and
dating_back
in
some
instances
to
colonial
times
,
severely
limit
the
types
of
merchandise
that
may
be
sold
on
the
Sabbath
.
The
Central_Falls
City_Council
expressed
concern
especially
that
more
foods
be
placed
on
the
eligible
list
and
that
neighborhood
grocery
and
variety
stores
be
allowed
to
do
business
on
Sunday
.
The
only
day
they
``
have
a
chance
to
compete
with
large
supermarkets
is
on
Sunday
''
,
the
council
's
resolution
said
.
The
small
shops
``
must
be
retained
,
for
they
provide
essential
service
to
the
community
''
,
according
to
the
resolution
,
which
added
that
they
``
also
are
the
source
of
livelihood
for
thousands
of
our
neighbors
''
.
It
declares
that
Sunday
sales
licenses
provide
``
great
revenue
''
to
the
local_government
.
The
council
advised
the
governor
that
``
large
supermarkets
,
factory
outlets
and
department_stores
not
be
allowed
to
do
business
''
on
Sunday
.
They
``
operate
on
a
volume
basis
''
,
it
was
contended
,
``
and
are
not
essential
to
provide
the
more
limited
but
vital
shopping
needs
of
the
community
''
.
Liberals
and
conservatives
in
both
parties
-
Democratic
and
Republican
-
should
divorce
themselves
and
form
two
independent
parties
,
George_H._Reama
,
nationally
known
labor-management
expert
,
said
here
yesterday
.
Mr._Reama
told
the
Rotary_Club
of
Providence
at
its
luncheon
at
the
Sheraton-Biltmore_Hotel
that
about
half
of
the
people
in
the
country
want
the
``
welfare
''
type
of
government
and
the
other
half
want
a
free_enterprise
system
.
He
suggested
that
a
regrouping
of
forces
might
allow
the
average
voter
a
better
pull
at
the
right
lever
for
him
on
election_day
.
He
said
he
was
``
confessing
that
I
was
a
member
of
the
Socialist_Party
in
1910
''
.
That
,
he
added
,
was
when
he
was
``
a
very
young_man
,
a
machinist
and
toolmaker
by
trade
.
``
That
was
before
I
studied
law
.
Some
of
my
fellow_workers
were
grooming
me
for
an
office
in
the
Socialist_Party
.
The
lawyer
with
whom
I
studied
law
steered
me
off
the
Socialist
track
.
He
steered
me
to
the
right
track
-
the
free_enterprise
track
''
.
He
said
that
when
he
was
a
Socialist
in
1910
,
the
party
called_for
government
operation
of
all
utilities
and
the
pooling
of
all
resources
.
He
suggested
that
without
the
Socialist_Party
ever
gaining
a
national
victory
,
most_of
its
original
program
has
come
to
pass
under
both
major
parties
.
Mr._Reama
,
who
retired
as
vice_president
of
the
American_Screw_Co.
in
1955
said
,
``
Both
parties
in
the
last
election
told
us
that
we
need
a
five
per_cent
growth
in
the
gross_national_product
-
but
neither
told
us
how
to
achieve
it
''
.
He
said
he
favors
wage
increases
for
workers
-
``
but
manufacturers
are
caught
in
a
profit
squeeze
''
-
and
raises
should
only
come
when
the
public
is
conditioned
to
higher
prices
,
he
added
.
Indicating
the
way
in_which
he
has
turned
his
back
on
his
1910
philosophy
,
Mr._Reama
said
:
``
A
Socialist
is
a
person
who
believes_in
dividing
everything
he
does
not
own
''
.
Mr._Reama
,
far
from
really
being
retired
,
is
engaged
in
industrial
relations
counseling
.
A
petition
bearing
the
signatures
of
more_than
1700
Johnston
taxpayers
was
presented
to
the
town
council
last
night
as
what
is
hoped
will
be
the
first
step
in
obtaining
a
home_rule
charter
for
the
town
.
William_A._Martinelli
,
chairman
of
the
Citizens
Group
of
Johnston
,
transferred
the
petitions
from
his
left_hand
to
his
right_hand
after
the
council
voted
to
accept
them
at
the
suggestion
of
Council_President_Raymond_Fortin_Sr.
.
The
law
which
governs
home_rule
charter
petitions
states
that
they
must
be
referred
to
the
chairman_of_the_board
of
canvassers
for
verification
of
the
signatures
within
10
days
and
Mr._Martinelli
happens
to
hold
that
post
.
Mr._Martinelli
explained
that
there
should
be
more_than
enough
signatures
to
assure
the
scheduling
of
a
vote
on
the
home_rule
charter
and
possible
election
of
a
nine
member
charter
commission
within
70
days
.
He
explained
that
by_law
the
council
must
establish
procedures
for
a
vote
on
the
issue
within
60
days
after
the
board
of
canvassers
completes
its
work
.
A
difference_of_opinion
arose
between
Mr._Martinelli
and
John_P._Bourcier
,
town
solicitor
,
over
the
exact
manner
in_which
the
vote
is
handled
.
Mr._Martinelli
has
,
in
recent
weeks
,
been
of
the
opinion
that
a
special
town_meeting
would
be_called
for
the
vote
,
while
Mr._Bourcier
said
that
a
special
election
might
be_called
instead
.
Mr._Bourcier
said
that
he
had
consulted
several
Superior_Court
justices
in
the
last
week
and
received
opinions
favoring
both
procedures
.
He
assured
Mr._Martinelli
and
the
council
that
he
would
study
the
correct
method
and
report
back
to
the
council
as
soon
as
possible
.
Mr._Martinelli
said
yesterday
that
the
Citizens
Group
of
Johnston
will
meet
again
July
24
to
plan
further
strategy
in
the
charter
movement
.
He
said
that
the
group
has
no
candidates
for
the
charter
commission
in
mind
at_present
,
but
that
it
will
undoubtedly
endorse
candidates
when_the_time_comes
.
``
After
inspiring
this
,
I
think
we
should
certainly
follow_through
on
it
''
,
he
declared
.
``
It
has
become
our
responsibility
and
I
hope
that
the
Citizens
Group
will
spearhead
the
movement
''
.
He
said
he
would
not
be
surprised
if
some
of
the
more_than
30
members
of
the
group
are
interested
in
running
on
the
required
non-partisan
ballot
for
posts
on
the
charter
commission
.
``
Our
most
immediate
goal
is
to
increase
public
awareness
of
the
movement
''
,
he
indicated
,
``
and
to
tell
them
what
this
will
mean
for
the
town
''
.
He
expects
that
if
the
present
timetable
is
followed
a
vote
will
be
scheduled
during
the
last
week
in
September
.
Some
opposition
to
the
home_rule
movement
started
to
be
heard
yesterday
,
with
spokesmen
for
the
town
's
insurgent
Democratic
leadership
speaking
out
against
the
home_rule
charter
in
favor
of
the
model
municipal
league
charter
.
Increasing
opposition
can
be
expected
in
coming
weeks
,
it
was
indicated
.
Misunderstanding
of
the
real
meaning
of
a
home_rule
charter
was
cited
as
a
factor
which
has
caused
the
Citizens
Group
to
obtain
signatures
under
what
were
termed
``
false
pretenses
''
.
Several
signers
affixed
their
names
,
it
was
learned
,
after
being
told
that
no
tax
increase
would
be
possible
without
consent
of
the
General_Assembly
and
that
a
provision
could
be
included
in
the
charter
to
have
the
town
take_over
the
Johnston_Sanitary_District
sewer_system
.
Action
on
a
new
ordinance
permitting
motorists
who
plead
guilty
to
minor
traffic
offenses
to
pay
fines
at
the
local
police_station
may
be
taken
at
Monday
's
special
North_Providence_Town_Council
meeting
.
Council
president
Frank_SanAntonio
said
yesterday
he
may
ask
the
council
to
formally
request
Town_Solicitor_Michael_A._Abatuno
to
draft
the
ordinance
.
At
the
last
session
of
the
General_Assembly
,
the
town
was
authorized
to
adopt
such
an
ordinance
as
a
means
of
making
enforcement
of
minor
offenses
more
effective
.
Nothing
has
been
done
yet
to
take_advantage
of
the
enabling
legislation
.
At_present
all
offenses
must
be
taken
to
Sixth_District_Court
for
disposition
.
Local
police
have
hesitated
to
prosecute
them
because
of
the
heavy
court
costs
involved
even
for
the
simplest
offense
.
