``
Thrifty
of
her

it
up

Unusual
in

like
this

''
-
``
You
can
joke
!
Did
n't
you
read
it
?
She
's
married
that
tenant
!
''
``
I
read
it
,
yes
.
This
ought
to
simplify
Tolley
's
life
''
.
Laban
had
more
to
say
.
Tolley
had
gone
to
live
in
California
.
He
'd
mentioned
it
,
himself
,
at
church
and
everybody
seemed
to
have
the
idea
that
Tolley
had
left
because
Jenny
had
jilted
him
for
Roy
robards
.
``
It
was
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
that
they
're
laughing
about
it
,
Mamma
.
Zion
stayed
to
get
my
pin
,
but
it
'll
be
a
cold
day
in
June
when
I
go_back
''
.
``
We
will
both
go_back
,
Laban
''
!
Kizzie
turned
to
go
inside
.
``
Let
me
stay
and
take
the
pictures
you
wanted
,
Mamma
.
The
sun
's
right
''
-
``
Pictures
''
?
She
swung
around
.
``
What
pictures
''
?
``
In
Brace
's
room
!
You
told
me
to
bring
my
camera
.
I
'm
not
going_back
''
-
``
Indeed
you
are
!
Why
should
I
want
pictures
of
an
empty
room
now
?
Tolley
had
no
idea
of
marrying
that
sneaky
little
Jenny
!
This
-
trip
of
his
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
consorting
with
tenants
,
and
I
am
going_to
see
that
everybody
at
Mt._Pleasant
understands
that
simple
fact
.
Wait
for
me
,
Laban
,
I
'll
be
dressed
in
half
a
second
''
!
Frank
followed
her
into
the
bedroom
,
hooked
her
dress
up
the
back
.
``
Hurry
,
Frank
!
They
're
not
going_to
laugh_at
the
Fairbrothers
and
Labans
very
long
!
Tolley
's
going
is
my
fault
.
I
drove
him
away
.
You
know
it
and
I
'll
tell
everybody
exactly
how
it
happened
''
.
She
was
so
beautiful
,
so
valiant
,
so
pitiable
.
He
kissed
her
.
``
Make
your
confession
to
God
,
Kizzie
dear
,
not
to
the
congregation
''
.
``
I
'll
decide
that
when
I
get
there
.
I
was
so
cruel
to
Tolley
,
so
unfair
.
But
I
'll
be
fair
now
!
He
is
coming_back
,
is
n't
he
,
Frank
''
?
Yes
,
oh
yes
.
What
else
was_there
to
say
?
Returning
to
the
log-house
he
found
some
favorite
lines
from
Jonathan_Swift
on
his
lips
:
``
Under
the
window
in
stormy
weather
I
marry
this
man
and
woman
together
.
Let
none
but
Him
who
rules
the
thunder
Put
this
man
and
woman
asunder
``
.
Absolution
for
his
lie
?
He
questioned
God
's
taking
time
to
telegraph
the
message
,
but
he
felt
better
about
Kizzie
,
and
he
took
the
sealed
envelope
from
its
pigeonhole
,
wondering
why
he
had
preserved
it
.
If
he
died
before
she
did
,
she
would
never
be
unable
to
resist
opening
it
.
In_any_case
he
would
be
thrusting
a
burden
on
his
remaining
sons
,
making
them
parties
to
a
deception
peculiarly
his
own
.
It
was
simply
his
necessity
to
confess
which
had
made
him
write
and
keep
this
thing
.
``
You
've
told
God
,
Frank
''
,
he
said
.
``
Why
lacerate
the
-
congregation
''
?
Reaching
for
an
old
clay
pot
,
relic
of
pioneer
days
,
he
tore
the
envelope
in
pieces
,
dropping
them
into
it
,
touching
the
little
pyre
to
flame
,
watching
it
curl
,
the
red
sealing_wax
melting
and
bubbling
in
the
feathery
ash
.
Surely
now
his
beloved
son
could
rest_in_peace
.
``
'
And
let
me
go
,
for
the
night
gathers
me
,
and
in
the
night
shall
no
man
gather
fruit
''
'
.
A
beautiful
and
haunting
line
,
a
subtle
genius
,
Swinburne
,
difficult
not
to
envy
a
gifted
man
,
and
perhaps
he
did
.
But
there
were
great
satisfactions
,
even
for
a
small
man
.
Beyond
his
window
were
the
greening
trees
,
new
spring
,
eternal
hope
,
eternal_life
.
There
lay
Grand_Fair
's
Quinzaine
,
his
own
young
parents
'
graves
,
but
new
life
and
promise
for
his
sons
,
grandsons
.
He
poured
his
thimble
of
wine
for
the
toast
he
'd
made
so
often
.
``
To
absent
loved_ones
''
.
But
this
last
time
he
drank
not
to
Brace
but
``
To
Tolley
''
!
Mr._Robards
-
Jenny
was
the
only
person
she
knew
of
in
the
Mt._Pleasant
neighborhood
who
called
him
that
-
was
kind
but
too
easygoing
.
It
did
n't
bother
him
for
everybody
from
the
blacksmith
to
the
preacher
to
say
,
``
Howdy
,
Miss_Jenny
''
,
adding
a
careless
``
Roy
''
,
but
it
did
her
.
He
could
put
a
stop
to_it
,
she
told
him
again_and_again
.
Simply
call
Mr._Whipsnade_Oscar
,
and
Dr._Dunne_P._G.
,
and
C
'
un
Major_Frank
.
Mr._Robards
laughed
,
said
he
'd
feel
a
damn
fool
,
plain-out
could
n't
do
that
even
to
please
her
.
``
You
could
try
.
And
if
I
ever
hear
you
say
'
Mist_Laban
'
again
I
'll
scream
.
And
do
n't
tell
me
you
did
n't
at
church
Sunday
.
I
heard
you
''
!
He
really
had
n't
meant
to
,
he
assured
her
,
but
it
was
plain
to
her
that
the
importance
of
these
small
things
was
lost
on
Mr._Robards
.
How
strange
it
was
that
he
could
give
her
this
handsome
house
and
carte_blanche
as
to
its
beautiful
furnishings
,
and
fail
her
in
-
spiritual
ways
.
Another
weakness
-
far
more
irritating
than
his
manner_of_speaking
,
which
he
made
only
token
effort
to
change
-
was
his
devotion
to_that
old
horse
of
Tolley
's
.
Her
horse
,
rather
.
But
Mr._Robards
'
now
,
oh
my
yes
,
indeed
,
yes
!
He
called
her
``
the
Mare
''
much_as
Mrs._Whipsnade
spoke
of
``
the
Queen
,
God
bless
her
''
.
He
,
with
fifteen
or
twenty
horses
or
mares
or
geldings
or
what-nots
out
there
in
the
barn
,
was
reverent
only
of
``
the
Mare
''
,
``
the
Racin
'
Mare
''
,
the
revolting
Gunny
.
For
the
first
few
months
of
their
marriage
she
had
tried
to
be
nice
about
Gunny
,
going
out
with
him
to
watch
this
pearl
without
price
stamp
imperiously
around
in
her
stall
.
And
what
had
happened
?
Gunny
invariably
tried
to
bite
her
.
Nerves
,
Mr._Robards
said
,
just
a
nip
anyway
.
``
Stand_back
,
Miss_Jen
,
she
's
oneasy
of
your
scarf
''
.
Never
,
``
Quit
that
,
you
sor
'
l
devil
''
!
Never
concern
for
his
wife
's
nerves
,
or
the
danger
that
the
curled
lip
and
big
teeth
might
mark
their
own
dear
baby
due
in
January
.
She
mus
n't
annoy
Gunny
whose
foal
was
due
then
too
!
Listening
for
hours
to
his
laments
that
the
war
and
``
Mist_Fair
's
''
poverty
afterwards
had
robbed
the
mare
of
many_a
racing
triumph
,
and
to
his
predictions
of
greatness
for
the
procession
of
foals
to
come
,
Jenny
could
look_forward
to
years
of
conflict
with
an
animal
who
disliked
her
intensely
and
showed
it
.
Gunny
symbolized
so_much
that
was
unpleasant
-
Tolley
,
the
indifference
with
which
the
Fairbrothers
and
indeed
the
whole
neighborhood
now
treated
her
and
which
she
would
die
rather_than
acknowledge
to
her
husband
,
his
lack
of
understanding
and
sympathy
in
her
present
condition
,
her
disgusting
swollen
stomach
.
Human
birth
was
no
novelty
to
Mr._Robards
.
Tillie
was
a
fine
midwife
and
could
get
here
quick
,
he
suggested
.
Jenny
's
aversion
to
having
Dr._Dunne
,
a
former
admirer
,
seemed
silly
to
him
,
but
he
would
humor
her
,
get
anybody
she
wanted
,
the
best
never
being
too
good
for
her
.
The
chances
were
against
his
being
here
to
humor
her
when
her
time
came
,
she
was
sure
.
He
would
be
in
the
barn
,
or
riding
for
the
veterinarian
!
Night
after
night
he
stayed
with
Gunny
in
the
dead
of
winter
,
rubbing
her
with
quarts
of
expensive
liniment
,
fussing
over
her
bran
mash
as
the
cook
did
over
charlotte_russe
,
tracking
manure
on
the
pretty
new
carpet
when
he
did
come
to
the
house
.
Yet
when
the
dear
baby
came
,
he
had
Tillie
over_here
in
a
jiffy
,
and
was
as
attentive
and
sweet
and
worried
and
happy
when
it
was
all_over
as
any
husband
could
have
been
.
Jenny
wished
now
that
she
had
had
Dr._Dunne
,
feeling
that
somehow
he
would
n't
have
allowed
the
dear
baby
to
turn_into
triplets
.
There
was
something
not
nice
about
triplets
,
though
their
father
seemed
pleased
,
showing
no
disappointment
that
they
had
n't
been
the
son
he
wanted
,
saying
,
``
You
do
n't
see
triplets
trippin
'
down
the
pike
ever
'
day
,
Miss_Jen
,
hon
.
Rhyme
'
em
up
cute
-
Arcilla
,
Flotilla
''
.
Edmonia
for
her
mother
,
she
said
firmly
,
Jennifer
,
for
herself
,
and
-
.
``
Kezziah
,
for
Miss_Kizzie
''
,
he
suggested
.
``
She
was
mighty
good
to
you
past_times
,
an
'
this
'll
fetch
her
''
.
Now
she
must
be
thinking_of
a
boy-name
,
something
special
.
Just
wait
till
she
saw
the
Mare
's
foal
.
Handsomest
colt
in_all
Kentucky
.
Strong
too
,
up_on
his
legs
when
he
was
an
hour
old
.
What
about
Royal_Robards
?
``
Why
do
n't
you
name
him
Jesus_Christ
!
''
She
burst
into
tears
.
Roy
was
deeply
distressed
.
He
'd
had
no
idea
how
unhappy
his
sweet
peach
had
been
.
Of_course
she
was
n't
herself
right_now
,
but
as
her
strength
came_back
her
spirits
did
n't
seem
to
rise
with_it
.
He
had
a
good
idea
why
not
.
Those
elegant
``
At_Home
''
cards
she
sent_out
,
now
she
could
wear
her
pretty
clothes
again
,
and
had
the
house
all
trimmed
up
,
had
n't
brought
many
callers
in
two
whole
months
.
Doc_Dunne
and
Miss_Sis
had
come
.
So
had
Miss_Shawnee_Rakestraw
,
full_of
criticisms
about
the
changes
here
,
giving
thanks
that
her
dear
old
father
had
gone
to
his
Heavenly_Rest
last
year
,
saying
how
much
she
enjoyed
her
boarding_house
in
town
in
inclement
weather
,
was
looking_forward
to
Quinzaine_Spa
this
summer
.
There
was
an
idea
.
Miss_Kizzie
had
been
right
snippy
ever
since
they
were
married
,
though
you
'd
have
thought
a
namesake
would
have
brought
her
round
.
Oh
,
she
'd
come
to
see
them
once
,
left
silver
teething_rings
for
all_of
the
trips
.
But
when
Miss_Jen
went
over
right_away
to
return
the
call
,
Miss_Kiz
could
n't
have
been
very
cordial
,
for
she
'd
come_back
before
she
hardly
had
time
to
get
there
.
More_and_more
,
these
days
,
she
'd
been
driving
that
pretty
little
mare
that
looked_like
her
,
over
to
Tillie
's
and
Nick
's
-
his
own
old
square
frame
box
on
posts
,
chickens
and
cats
and
pups
under
the
house
,
everybody
friendly
inside
,
making
a
to-do
over
the
babies
dressed
like
dollies
.
Though
he
was
glad
she
got_on
well
with
his
young
folks
,
she
ought
to
be
welcome
at
the
finest
house
in
the
land
,
too
.
It
made
him
pretty
hot_under_the_collar
,
after
the
idea
Miss_Sis
had
given
him
,
to
be
told
by
Miss_Kiz
that
her
holy
spa
was
all
reserved
for
this
summer
and
next
,
if
you
please
,
and
that_much
as
she
regretted
it
,
they
would
be
unable
to
entertain
Mrs._Robards
and
the
children
.
She
hoped
they
were_well
.
He
did
n't
tell
Miss_Jen
,
but
she
must
have
got_word
from
the
cook
or
nurse
,
who
of_course
knew
those
Quinzaine
nigs
,
and
she
really
took
a
fit
.
If
he
ever
did
such
a
thing
again
she
'd
die
of
shame
.
``
Have
a
party
an
'
leave
'
em
out
,
hon
''
,
he
suggested
.
``
A
swell
party
,
send
an
invite
to
ever
'
body
but
them
-
those
folks
you
met
at
the
Galt_House
,
the
ones
I
've
got
to
know
in_this
new
Jockey_Club
affair
,
the
whole
dang
neighborhood
.
We
'll
have
oystchers
-
couple
bar
'
l
oystchers

crowd

time

I
'll
see

gets
round
''
.
``
Do
n't
you
dare
!
''
Miss_Jen
was
funny
that
way
,
funny
that
she
did
n't
seem
to
take_to
his
ideas
and
perk_up
.
He
was
downright
worried
about
her
,
but
there
was
one
more
thing
he
could
try
.
Zion
was
surprised
when
Roy
's
buggy
stopped
beside
her
on
the
pike
one
early
summer
day
as
she
was
walking
home
from
the
country
school
where
she
was
teaching
now
that
Eph_Showers
had
had
a
call
to
preach
in
some
mountain
town
.
Roy
smiled
-
he
did
have
a
nice
smile
-
took_off
his
hat
most
politely
,
told
her
to
hop
in
,
and
he
'd
give
her
a
lift
to
Quinzaine
.
Her
hesitation
was
only
momentary
and
she
hoped
he
did
n't
notice
it
,
as
she
settled
herself
,
asked
quickly
how
Miss_Jenny
and
the
babies
were
getting_on
.
``
See
for
yourself
,
Miss_Zion
.
It
won
n't
take
a
minute
''
.
He
swung
in
through
his
own
wide
gateway
.
``
Them
's
the
purtiest
babes
you
ever
did
see
,
but
Miss_Jen
gets
mighty
lonesome
.
She
'll
relish
the
sight
of
a
friendly
face
.
Miss_Kiz
won
n't
care
your
comin
'
,
will
she
''
?
``
Why
of_course
not
''
,
Zion
said
uncomfortably
.
