A
philosopher
may
point_out
that
the
troubles
of
the
Congo
began
with
the
old
Adam
and
consequently
will
never
end
.
But
a
historian
might
put
his
finger
on
a
specific
man
and
date
,
and
hold_out
the
hope
that
the
troubles
will
sometime
pass_away
.
The
man
was
King_Leopold
2
,
of
the
Belgians
,
who
in
1885
concluded
that
he
had_better
grab
a
colony
while
the
grabbing
was
still
good
.
By
force
,
he
took
under
his
protection
,
or
stole
,
900000
square_miles
of
wilderness
in
Central_Africa
.
This
is
an
area
nearly
as
large
as
Western
Europe
;
and
it
was
filled
then
as
now
by
quarreling
tribes
with
no
political
or
historical
unity
.
Its
boundaries
had
nothing
to
do
with
geography
or
ethnic
groupings
;
they
were
determined
by
the
points
at
which
Leopold
's
explorers
and
gunmen
got
tired
of
walking
.
The
population
of
the
Congo
is
13.5
million
,
divided
into
at_least
seven
major
``
culture
clusters
''
and
innumerable
tribes
speaking
400
separate
dialects
.
The
religions
of
the
people
include
Christianity
,
Mohammedanism
,
paganism
,
ancestor_worship
and
animism
.
The
climate
ranges
from
the
steamily
equatorial
to
the
temperate
.
The
hospitals
contain
patients
trampled
by
elephants
or
run_over
by
sports_cars
.
To
make
one
nation
out
of
these
disparities
would
be
a
problem
large
enough
in_any_case
;
it
has
been
made
far
more
difficult
by
what
the
Belgians
have
done
,
or
failed
to
do
,
in
the
Congo
since
1885
.
At_first
the
Belgian
royal_family
administered
the
Congo
as
its
own
private_property
.
But
by
1908
its
record
of
brutality
had
touched
the
national
conscience
.
The
Belgian
government
itself
took_over
administration
,
commencing
a
program
of
paternalism
unmatched
in
the
history
of
colonialism
.
One
definition
of
paternalism
is
``
The
principle
or
practice
,
on
the
part
of
a
government
,
of
managing
the
affairs
of
a
country
in
the
manner
of
a
father
dealing
with
his
children
''
.
The
honor
of
the
Belgians
in_this
matter
is
not
to
be
questioned
-
only
their
judgment
.
Ordinarily
a
father
permits
his
children
to
grow_up
in_due_time
-
but
when
the
colony
received
independence
in
1960
the
Congolese
child
,
if
one
imagines
him
to
have
been_born
in
1908
,
was
52
and
had
until
then
been
treated
as
an
infant
.
The
Belgians
were
interested
primarily
in
the
economic
development
of
the
Congo
,
which
is
rich_in
copper
,
tin
,
cobalt
,
manganese
,
zinc
,
and
uranium
,
and
cotton
and
palm_oil
.
The
colony
was
administered
from
Brussels
,
with
neither
the
Congolese
nor
the
resident
Belgians
having
any
vote
.
The
beneficiaries
of_this
administration
were
a_number_of
huge
cartels
in_which
both
individuals
and
the
Belgian
government
itself
held
stock
.
In
Inside
Africa
,
John_Gunther
describes
one
of
these
,
the
Societe_Generale
,
as
``
the
kind_of
colossus
that
might
be
envisaged
if
,
let
us
say
,
the
House
of
Morgan
,
Anaconda
Copper
,
the
Mutual
Life_Insurance
Company
of
New_York
,
the
Pennsylvania_Railroad
,
and
various
companies
producing
agricultural
products
were
lumped
together
,
with
the
United_States_government
as
a
heavy
partner
''
.
Had
they
been
truly
ruthless
,
the
Belgians
might
have
exploited
the
Congolese
without
compassion
.
But
they
were
not
.
They
provided
a
social_security
system
which
covered
all
their
African
employes
;
their
program
of
mass
medical_care
was
doubtless
the
best
on
the
continent
;
they
put
much
effort
into
public
housing
.
They
also
instituted
a
ration
system
under
which
all
employers
in
the
Congo
were
required
to
furnish
their
employes
with
clothing
and
adequate
food
.
But
instead
of
delivering
the
ration
-
either
in
actual
commodities
or
in
cash
-
at
intervals
of
perhaps
two_weeks
or
a
month
,
the
Belgians
felt
obliged
to
dole
it
out
more_often
.
Would
not
the
children
,
if
they
received
all
their
food
on
the
first
day_of_the_month
,
eat
it
up
immediately
,
and
later
go_hungry
?
The
Belgians
also
placed
great
emphasis
on
education
.
During
the
1950
s
there
were
as_many
as
25000
schools
in
the
Congo
.
But
almost
all
the
schools
were
primary
.
The
average
Congolese
can
do
little
more_than
puzzle_out
the
meaning
of
``
la
chatte
''
and
``
le
chien
''
and
write
his
name
.
Some
schools
were
technical
-
the
Belgians
needed
carpenters
and
mechanics
to
help
exploit
the
land
,
and
trained
many
.
But
they
did
not
believe_in
widespread
secondary
education
,
much
less
in
college
.
It
was
their
conviction
that
the
people
should
be
``
brought_up
together
''
,
a
grade
at_a_time
,
until
in
some
indefinite
future
some
might
be
ready
to
tackle
history
,
economics
and
political_science
.
Indeed
,
the
Belgians
discouraged
higher
education
,
fearing
the
creation
of
a
native
intellectual
elite
which
might
cause
unrest
.
When
the
Congo
received
its
independence
in
1960
there
were
,
among
its
13.5
million
people
,
exactly
14
university
graduates
.
Why
did
the
Belgians
grant
independence
to
a
colony
so
manifestly
unprepared
to
accept
it
?
In
one
large
oversimplification
,
it
might
be
said
that
the
Belgians
felt
,
far
too
late
,
the
gale
of
nationalism
sweeping
Africa
.
They
lacked
time
to
prepare
the
Congo
,
as
the_British
and
French
had
prepared
their
colonies
.
The
Congolese
were
clamoring
for
their
independence
,
even_though
most
were
unsure
what
it
meant
;
and
in
Brussels
,
street
crowds
shouted
,
``
Pas
une
goutte
de
sang
!
''
(
Not_one
drop
of
blood
!
)
.
The
Belgians
would
not
fight
for
the
privilege
of
being
the
detested
pedagogue
;
rather_than
teach
where
teaching
was
not
wanted
,
they
would
wash_their_hands
of
the
mess
.
It
is
hard
to
blame
them
for
this
.
Yet
there
were
other
motivations
and
actions
which
the
Belgians
took
after
independence
for
which
history
may_not
find
them
guiltless
.
As
the
time
for
independence
approached
there
were
in
the
Congo
no_fewer_than
120
political_parties
,
or
approximately
eight
for
each
university
graduate
.
There
were
four
principal
ones
.
First
,
there
were
those
Congolese
(
among
them
Joseph_Kasavubu
)
who
favored
splitting
the
country
into
small
independent
states
,
Balkanizing
it
.
Second
,
there
were
those
(
Moise_Tshombe
)
who
favored
near-Balkanization
,
a
loose
federalism
having
a
central
government
of
limited
authority
,
with
much
power
residing
in
the
states
.
Third
,
there
were
those
(
notably
Patrice_Lumumba
)
who
favored
a
unified
Congo
with
a
very
strong
central
government
.
And
fourth
,
there
were
moderates
who
were
in
no
hurry
for
independence
and
wished
to
wait
until
the
Congo
grew_up
.
However
,
the
positions
of
all
parties
and
leaders
were
constantly
shifting
.
A
final
factor
which
contributed
greatly
to
the
fragmentation
of
the
Congo
,
immediately
after
independence
,
was
the
provincial
structure
that
had
been
established
by
the
Belgians
for
convenience
in
administration
.
They
had
divided
the
Congo
into
six
provinces
-
Leopoldville
,
Kasai
,
Kivu
,
Katanga
,
Equator
and
Eastern
-
unfortunately
with
little
regard
for
ethnic
groupings
.
Thus
some
provinces
contained
tribes
which
detested
each
other
,
and
to
them
independence
meant
an
opportunity
for
war
.
The
Belgian_Congo
was
granted
its
independence
with
what
seemed
a
workable
Western-style
form_of_government
:
there
were
to
be
a
president
and
a
premier
,
and
a
bicameral
legislature
elected
by
universal
suffrage
in
the
provinces
.
Well-wishers
around
the
world
hoped
that
the
Congo
would
quickly
assume
a
respectable
position
in
the
society
of
nations
.
If
internal
frictions
arose
,
they
could
be
handled
by
the
25000
-
man
Congolese
army
,
the
Force_Publique
,
which
had
been
trained
and
was
still
officered
by
white
Belgians
.
The
president
,
Joseph_Kasavubu
,
seemed
an
able
administrator
and
the
premier
,
Patrice_Lumumba
,
a
reasonable
man
.
Twenty-four_hours
after
independence
the
wild
tribesmen
commenced
fighting
each
other
.
Presently
the
well-armed
members
of
the
Force_Publique
-
many_of
them
drawn
from
savage
and
even
cannibalistic
tribes
,
erupted
in
mutiny
,
rioting
,
raping
and
looting
.
Terror
engulfed
the
thousands
of
Belgian
civilians
who
had
remained
in
the
country
.
The
Belgian
government
decided
to
act
,
and
on
July
10
dispatched
paratroops
to
the
Congo
.
On
July
11
the
head
of
the
mineral-rich
province
of
Katanga
,
Moise_Tshombe
,
announced
that
his
province
had
seceded
from
the
country
.
Confusion
became
chaos
;
each
succeeding
day
brought
new
acts
of
violence
.
Lumumba
and
Kasavubu
blamed
it
all
on
the
military
intervention
by
the
Belgians
,
and
appealed_to
the
United_Nations
to
send
troops
to
oust
them
.
On
July_14
the
Security_Council
-
with
France
and
Great_Britain
abstaining
-
voted
the
resolution
which
drew
the
U._N.
into
the
Congo
.
Vague
in
wording
,
it
called_for
withdrawal
of
Belgian
troops
and
authorized
the
Secretary-General
``
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
provide
the
[
Congolese
]
Government
with
such
military
assistance
as
may
be
necessary
,
until
,
through
the
efforts
of
the
Congolese_Government
with
the
technical
assistance
of
the
United_Nations
,
the
national
security_forces
may
be
able
,
in
the
opinion
of
the
Government
,
to
meet
fully
their
tasks
''
.
Secretary-General_Hammarskjo
^
ld
decided
that
it
would
be
preferable
if
the
U._N.
troops
sent
into
the
Congo
were
to
come
from
African
,
or
at_least
nonwhite
,
nations
-
certainly
not
from
the
U._S.
,
Russia
,
Great_Britain
or
France
.
He
quickly
called_on
Ghana
,
Tunisia
,
Morocco
,
Guinea
and
Mali
,
which
dispatched
troops
within
hours
.
Ultimately
the
U._N.
army
in
the
Congo
reached
a
top
strength
of
19000
,
including
about
5000
from
India
and
a_few
soldiers
from
Eire
and
Sweden
,
who
were
the
only
whites
.
It
took
the
U._N.
three
months
to
bring
a
modest
form
of
order
to
the
Congo
.
The
Belgians
were
reluctant
to
withdraw
their
troops
and
often
obstructed
U._N.
efforts
.
The
wildly
erratic
nature
of
Patrice_Lumumba
caused
constant
problems
-
he
frequently
announced
that
he
wanted
the
U._N.
to
get_out
of
the
Congo
along
with
the
Belgians
,
and
appealed_to
Russia
for
help
.
(
However
,
there
is
little
evidence
that
the
late
Lumumba
was
a
Communist
.
Before
appealing_to
the
U._N.
or
to
Russia
,
he
first
appealed_to
the
U._S.
for
military
help
,
and
was
rejected
.
)
Lumumba
further
complicated
the
U.
N
.
's
mission
by
initiating
small
``
wars
''
with
the
secessionist
province
of
Katanga
and
with
South_Kasai
which
,
under
Albert_Kalonji
,
wanted
to
secede
as_well
.
Meanwhile
Russia
took
every
opportunity
to
meddle
in
the
Congo
,
sending
Lumumba
equipment
for
his
``
wars
''
,
dispatching
``
technicians
''
and
even
threatening
,
on_occasion
,
to
intervene
openly
.
But
by
the
end
of
the
three-month
period
,
in
October
1960
,
something
approaching
calm
settled
on
the
Congo
.
President_Kasavubu
became
exasperated
with
Lumumba
and
fired
him
.
Lumumba
fired
Kasavubu
.
Control
of
the
government
-
such
control
as
there
was
and
such
government
as
there
was
-
passed
into
the
hands
of
Joseph_Mobutu
,
chief_of_staff
of
the
Congolese
army
.
Mobutu
promptly
flung_out
the
Russians
,
who
have
not
since
played
any
significant
part
on
the
local
scene
,
although
they
have
redoubled
their
obstructionist
efforts
at
U._N.
headquarters
in
New_York
.
The
Belgians
-
at_least
officially
-
departed
from
the
Congo
as_well
,
withdrawing
all_of
their
uniformed
troops
.
But
they
left
behind
them
large_numbers
of
officers
,
variously
called
``
volunteers
''
or
``
mercenaries
''
,
who
now
staff
the
army
of
Moise_Tshombe
in
Katanga
,
the
seceded
province
which
,
according
to
Tshombe
,
holds
65
%
of
the
mineral
wealth
of
the
entire
country
.
From
October
1960
to
February
1961
,
the
U._N.
forces
in
the
Congo
took
little
action
.
There
was
no
directive
for
it
-
the
Security_Council
's
resolution
had
not
mentioned
political
matters
,
and
in_any_case
the
United_Nations
by
the
terms
of
its
charter
may_not
interfere
in
the
political
affairs
of
any
nation
,
whether
to
unify
it
,
federalize
it
or
Balkanize
it
.
During
the
five-month
lull
,
civil_war
smoldered
and
flickered
throughout
the
Congo
.
In
February
the
murder
of
Patrice_Lumumba
,
who
had
been
kidnaped
into
Katanga
and
executed
on
order
of
Tshombe
,
again
stirred
the
U._N.
to
action
.
On
Feb.
21
the
council
passed
another
resolution
urging
the
taking
of
``
all
appropriate
measures
to
prevent
the
occurrence
of
civil_war
in
the
Congo
,
including
the
use
of
force
,
if
necessary
,
in
the
last_resort
''
.
Although
the
resolution
might
have
been
far
more
specific
,
it
was
considerably
tougher
than
the
earlier
one
.
It
also
urged
that
the
U._N.
eject
,
and
prevent
the
return
of
,
all
Belgian
and
other
foreign
military
and
political
advisers
;
ordered
an
investigation
of
Lumumba
's
death
;
urged
the
reconvention
of
the
Congolese_Parliament
and
the
reorganization
of
the
army
.
