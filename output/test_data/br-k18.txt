She
was
getting
real
dramatic
.
I
'd
have
been
more
impressed
if
I
had
n't
remembered
that
she
'd
played
Hedda_Gabler
in
her
highschool
dramatics
course
.
I
did
n't
want
her
back
on
that
broken
record
.
``
Nothing
's
free
in
the
whole
goddam
world
''
,
was
all
I
could
think_of
to
say
.
When
I
'd
delivered
myself
of
that
gem
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
order
up
another
drink
.
``
I
am
''
,
she
said
.
I
'd
forgotten
all
about
Thelma
and
the
Kentucky_Derby
and
how
it
was
Thelma
's
fifty
dollars
I
was
spending
.
It
was
just
me
and
Eileen
getting
drunk
together
like
we
used_to
in
the
old
days
,
and
me
staring
at
her
across
the
table
crazy
to
get
my
hands
on
her
partly
because
I
wanted
to
wring
her
neck
because
she
was
so
ornery
but
mostly
because
she
was
so
wonderful
to
touch
.
Drunk
or
sober
she
was
the
most
attractive
woman
in
the
world
for
me
.
I
was
crazy
about
her
all
over_again
.
It
was
the
call
of
the
wild
all_right
.
That
evening
turned_out
to
be
hell
like
all
the
others
.
We
moved
down
Broadway
from
ginmill
to
ginmill
.
It
was
the
same
old
routine
.
Eileen
got_to
dancing
,
just
a_little
tiny
dancing
step
to
a
hummed
tune
that
you
could
hardly
notice
,
and
trying
to
pick_up
strange
men
,
but
each
time
I
was
ready
to
say
to_hell_with_it
and
walk_out
she
'd
pull
herself
together
and
talk
so
understandingly
in
that
sweet
husky
voice
about
the
good
times
and
the
happiness
we
'd
had
together
and
there
I
was
back
on_the_hook
.
I
did
have
the
decency
to
call_up
Thelma
and
tell
her
I
'd
met
old
friends
and
would
be
home
late
.
``
I
could
scratch
her
eyes
out
''
,
Eileen
cried
and
stamped
her
foot
when
I
came_back
from
the
phone_booth
.
``
You
know
I
do
n't
like
my
men
to
have
other
women
.
I
hate
it
.
I
hate
it
''
.
She
got
so
drunk
I
had_to
take
her
home
.
It
was
a
walk_up
on
Hudson_Street
.
She
just_about
made
me
carry
her
upstairs
and_then
she
clung_to
me
and
would
n't
let
me
go
.
There
was
a
man
's
jacket
on
the
chair
and
a
straw_hat
on
the
table
.
The
place
smelt
of
some
kind
of
hair
lotion
these
pimp
like
characters
use
.
``
What
about
Ballestre
''
?
I
had_to
shake
her
to
make
her
listen
.
``
Precious
.
What
about
him
''
?
Suddenly
she
was
very
mysterious
and
dramatic
.
``
Precious
and
I
allow
each
other
absolute
freedom
.
We
are
above
being
jealous
.
He
's
used_to
me
bringing
home
strange
men
.
I
'll
just
tell
him
you
're
my
husband
.
He
can
n't
object
to
that
''
.
``
Well
I
object
.
If
he
pokes
his
nose
in
here
I
'll
slug
him
''
.
``
That
really
would
be
funny
''
.
She
began
to
laugh
.
She
was
still
laughing
when
I
grabbed
her
and
started
rolling
her
on
the
bed
.
After_all
I'm
made
of
flesh
and
blood
.
I'm
not
a
plaster_saint
.
Waking_up
was
horrible
.
Never
in
my
life
have
I
felt
so
remorseful
about
anything
I
've
done
as
I
did
about
spending
that
night
with
my
own
wife
.
We
both
had
hangovers
.
Eileen
declared
she
could
n't
lift
her
head
from
the
pillow
.
She
lay
under
the
covers
making
jabbing
motions
with
her
forefinger
telling
me
where
to
look_for
the
coffeepot
.
I
was
stumbling
in
my
undershirt
trying
to
find
my
way
around
her
damn
kitchenette
when
I
smelt
that
sickish
sweet
hairtonic
smell
.
There
was
somebody
else
in
the
apartment
.
I
stiffened
.
Honest
I
could
feel
the
hair
stand_up
on
the
back
of
my
neck
like
a
dog
's
that
is
going_to
get_into
a
fight
.
I
turned_around
with
the
percolator
in
my
hand
.
My
eyes
were
so
bleary
I
could
barely
see
him
but
there
he
was
,
a
little
smooth
olivefaced
guy
in
a
new
spring
overcoat
and
a
taffy
colored
fedora
.
Brown
eyes
,
eyebrow
mustache
.
Oval
face
without
an
expression
in_the_world
.
We
did
n't
have
time
to
speak
before
Eileen
's
voice
was
screeching
at
us
from
the
bed
.
``
Joseph_Maria_Ballestre
meet
Francis_Xavier_Bowman
.
Exboyfriend
meet
exhusband
''
.
She
gave
the
nastiest
laugh
I
ever
heard
.
``
And
do
n't
either
of
you
forget
that
I'm
not
any
man
's
property
.
If
you
want_to
fight
,
go
down
on
the
sidewalk
''
.
She
was
enjoying
the
situation
.
Imagine
that
.
Eileen
was
a
psychologist
all_right
.
Instead
of
wanting_to
sock
the
poor
bastard
I
found
myself
having
a
fellow-feeling
for
him
.
Maybe
he
felt
the
same
way
.
I
never
felt
such
a
lowdown
hound
in
my
life
.
First
thing
I
knew
he
was
in
the
kitchenette
cooking_up
the
breakfast
and
I
was
handing
Eileen
her
coffee-cup
and
she
was
lying
there
handsome
as
a
queen
among
her
courtiers
.
I
could
n't
face
Thelma
after
that
night
.
I
did
n't
even
have
the
nerve
to
call
her
on
the
telephone
.
I
wrote
her
that
I
'd
met_up_with
Eileen
and
that
old
bonds
had
proved
too
strong
and
asked
her
to
send
my
clothes
down
by
express
.
Of_course
I
had_to
give
her
Eileen
's
address
,
but
she
never
came_near
us
.
All
she
did
was
write
me
a
pleasant
little
note
about
how
it
was
beautiful
while
it
lasted
but
that
now
life
had
parted
our
ways
and
it
was
goodbye
forever
.
She
never
said
a
word
about
the
fifty
dollars
.
She
added
a
postscript
begging
me
to
be
careful
about
drinking
.
I
must
know
that
that
was
my
greatest
weakness
underlined
three
times
.
Afterwards
I
learned
that
Eileen
had
called
Thelma
on
the
telephone
and
made
a
big
scene
about
Thelma
trying
to
take
her
husband
away
.
That
finished
me
with
Thelma
.
Trust
Eileen
to
squeeze
all
the
drama
out
of
a
situation
.
And
there
I
was
shacked_up
with
Eileen
in
that
filthy
fourth
floor
attic
on
Hudson_Street
.
I
use
the
phrase
advisedly
because
there
was
something
positively
indecent
about
our
relationship
.
I
felt
it
and
it
ate_on
me
all_the_time
,
but
I
did
n't
know
how
right
I
was
till
later
.
What
I
did
know
was
that
Precious
was
always
around
.
He
slept
in
the
hall
bedroom
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
.
``
Who
do
you
think
pays
the
rent
?
You
would
n't
have
me
throw
the
poor
boy
out
on
the
street
''
,
Eileen
said
when
I
needled
her
about
it
.
I
said
sure
that
was
what
I
wanted
her
to
do
but
she
paid
no
attention
.
Eileen
had
a
wonderful
way
of
not
listening
to
things
she
did
n't
want_to
hear
.
Still
I
did
n't
think
she
was
twotiming
me
with
Precious
right
then
.
To
be
on
the
safe
side
I
never
let
Eileen
get_out
of
my
sight
day
or
night
.
Precious
had
me
worried
.
I
could
n't
make_out
what
his
racket
was
.
I
'd
thought
him
a
pimp
or
procurer
but
he
did
n't
seem
to
be
.
He
was
smooth
and
civil
spoken
but
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
something
tough
under
his
self-effacing
manner
.
Still
he
let
Eileen
treat
him
like
a
valet
.
Whenever
the
place
was
cleaned
or
a
meal
served
it
was
Precious
who
did
the
work
.
I
never
could
find_out
what
his
business
was
.
He
always
seemed
to
have
money
in
his
pocket
.
The
phone
had
been
disconnected
but
telegrams
came
for
him
and
notes
by
special
messenger
.
Now_and_then
he
would
disappear
for
several
days
.
``
Connections
''
was
all
he
would
say
with
that
smooth
hurt
smile
when
I
put
leading
questions
.
``
Oh
he
's
just
an
international
spy
''
,
Eileen
would
shout
with
her
screechy
laugh
.
Poor_devil
he
can
n't
have
been
too
happy
either
.
He
got
no
relief
from
drink
because
,
though
sometimes
Precious
would
buy
himself
a
drink
if
he
went
out
with
us
in
the
evening
,
he
'd
leave
it
on
the
table
untouched
.
When
I
was
in
liquor
I
rode
him
pretty
hard
I
guess
.
Occasionally
if
I
pushed
him
too
far
he
'd
give
me
a
look
out
of
narrowed
eyes
and
the
hard
cruel
bony
skull
would
show
through
that
smooth
face
of
his
.
``
Some_day
''
,
I
told
Eileen
,
``
that
guy
will
kill
us
both
''
.
She
just
would
n't
listen
.
Getting
drunk
every_night
was
the
only
way
I
could
handle
the
situation
.
Eileen
seemed
to
feel
the
same
way
.
We
still
had
that
much
in_common
.
The
trouble
was
drinking
cost
money
.
The
way
Eileen
and
I
were
hitting_it_up
,
we
needed
ten
or
fifteen
dollars
an
evening
.
Eileen
must
have
wheedled
a_little
out
of
Precious
.
I
raised
some
kale
by
hocking
the
good
clothes
I
had
left_over
from
my
respectable
uptown
life
,
but
when
that
was
gone
I
did
n't
have
a
cent
.
I
do
n't
know
what
we
would
have
done
if
Pat_O'Dwyer
had
n't
come
to
town
.
Pat_O'Dwyer
looked_like
a
heavier
Jim
.
He
had
the
same
bullet_head
of
curly
reddish
hair
but
he
did
n't
have
Jim
's
poker-faced
humor
or
his
brains
or
his
charm
.
He
was
a
big
thick
beefy
violent
man
.
Now
Pat
may
have
been
a
lecher
and
a
plug-ugly
,
but
he
was
a
good
churchgoing
Catholic
and
he
loved
his
little_sister
.
Those
O'Dwyers
had
that
Irish
clannishness
that
made
them
stick_together
in_spite
of
politics
and
everything
.
Pat
took
Eileen
and
me
out
to
dinner
at
a
swell
steak_house
and
told
us
with
tears
in
his
eyes
how
happy
he
was
we
had
come
together
again
.
``
Whom
God
hath
joined
''
etcetera
.
The
O'Dwyers
were
real
religious
people
except
for
Kate
.
Now
it
would
be
up_to
me
to
keep
the
little
girl
out
of
mischief
.
Pat
had
been
worried
as
hell
ever
since
she
'd
lost
her
job
on
that
fashion
magazine
.
It
had
gone
big
with
the
Hollywood
girls
when
he
told
them
his
sister
was
an
editor
of
Art_and_Apparel
.
How
about
me
trying
to
help
her
get
her
job
back
?
All
evening
Eileen
had
been
as
demure
as
a
little
girl
getting
ready
for
her
first
communion
.
It
just_about
blew
us
both
out
of
the
water
when
Eileen
suddenly
came_out
with
what
she
came_out
with
.
``
But
brother
I
can
n't
take
a
job
right
now
''
,
she
said
with
her
eyes
on
her
ice_cream
,
``
I'm
going_to
have
a
baby
,
Francis_Xavier
's
baby
,
my
own
husband
's
baby
''
.
My
first
thought
was
how
had
it
happened
so
soon
,
but
I
counted
back
on
my
fingers
and
sure_enough
we
'd
been
living
together
six
weeks
.
Pat
meanwhile
was
bubbling_over
with
sentiment
.
Greatest
thing
that
ever
happened
.
Now
Eileen
really
would
have_to
settle_down
to
love
honor
and
obey
,
and
she
'd
have_to
quit
drinking
.
He
'd
come
East
for
the
christening
,
by_God
he
would
.
When
we
separated
that
evening
Pat
pushed
a_hundred
dollar_bill
into
Eileen
's
hand
to
help
towards
a
layette
.
Before
he
left
town
Pat
saw_to_it
that
I
was
fixed_up
with
a
job
.
Pat
had
contacts
all_over
the
labor_movement
.
A
friend
of
Pat
's
named
Frank_Sposato
had
just
muscled_into
the
Portwatchers_'_Union
.
The
portwatchers
were
retired
longshoremen
and
small_time
seafarers
off
towboats
and
barges
who
acted_as
watchmen
on
the
wharves
.
Most
of
them
were
elderly
men
.
It
was
responsible
and
sometimes
dangerous
work
because
the
thieving
is
awful
in
the
port
of
New_York
.
They
were
n't
as
well
paid
as
they
should
have
been
.
One
reason
the
portwatchers
let
Sposato
take
them
over
was
to
get
the
protection
of
his
musclemen
.
Sposato
needed
a
front
,
some
labor
stiff
with
a
clean
record
to
act_as
business_agent
of
the
Redhook
local
.
There
I
was
a
retired
wobbly
and
structural
iron_worker
who
'd
never
gouged
a
cent
off
a
fellow_worker
in
my
thirty
years
in
the
movement
.
For
once
radicalism
was
a
recommendation
.
Sposato
could
n't
wait
to
get
me
hired
.
With
my
gray
hair
and
my
weatherbeaten
countenance
I
certainly
looked
the
honest
working
stiff
.
The
things
a
man
will
do
for
a
woman
.
