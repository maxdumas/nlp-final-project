Thomas_Douglas
,
fifth
Earl
of
Selkirk
,
a
noble
humanitarian
Scot
concerned
with
the
plight
of
the
crofters
of
his
native
Highlands
,
conceived
a
plan
to
settle
them
in
the
valley
of
the
Red_River
of
the
North
.
Since
the
land
he
desired
lay
within
the
great
northern
empire
of
the
Hudson's_Bay_Company
,
he
purchased
great
blocks
of
the
Company's
stock
with
the
view
to
controlling
its
policies
.
Having
achieved
this
end
,
he
was
able
to
buy
116000
square_miles
in
the
valleys
of
the
Red
and
Assiniboine
rivers
.
The
grant
,
which
stretched
southward
to
Lake_Traverse
-
the
headwaters
of
the
Red
-
was
made
in
May
,
1811
,
and
by
October
of
that
year
a
small
group
of
Scots
was
settling
for
the
winter
at
York_Factory
on
Hudson_Bay
.
Thus
at
the
same
time
that
William_Henry_Harrison
was
preparing
to
pacify
the
aborigines
of
Indiana_Territory
and
winning
fame
at
the
battle
of
Tippecanoe
,
Anglo-Saxon
settlement
made
a
great
leap
into
the
center
of
the
North_American
continent
to
the
west
of
the
American
agricultural
frontier
.
Seven
hundred
miles
south
of
York_Factory
,
at
``
the
Forks
''
of
the
Red
and
the
Assiniboine
,
twenty-three
men
located
a
settlement
in
August
1812
.
By
October
the
little
colony
about
Fort_Douglas
(
present-day
Winnipeg
)
numbered
100
.
Within
a_few
years
the
Scots
,
engaged
in
breaking
the
thick
sod
and
stirring
the
rich
soil
of
the
valley
,
were
joined
by
a
group
called
Meurons
.
The
latter
,
members
of
two
regiments
of
Swiss
mercenaries
transported
by
Great_Britain
to
Canada
to
fight
the
Americans
in
the
War_of_1812
,
had
settled
in
Montreal
and
Kingston
at
the
close
of
the
war
in
1815
.
Selkirk
persuaded
eighty
men
and
four
officers
to
go_to
Red_River
where
they
were
to
serve
as
a
military_force
to
protect
his
settlers
from
the
hostile
Northwest_Company
which
resented
the
intrusion
of
farmers
into
the
fur
traders
'
empire
.
The
mercenaries
were
little
interested
in
farming
and
added
nothing
to
the
output
of
the
farm
plots
on
which
all
work
was
still
done
with
hoes
as
late
as
1818
.
It
was
the
low
yield
of
the
Selkirk
plots
and
the
ravages
of
grasshoppers
in
1818
that
led
to
the
dispersal
of
the
settlement
southward
.
When
late
in
the
summer
the
full
extent
of
the
damage
was
assessed
,
all
but
fifty
of
the
Scots
,
Swiss
and
metis
moved
up
the
Red
to
the
mouth
of
the
Pembina
river
.
Here
they
built
huts
and
a
stockade
named
Fort_Daer
after
Selkirk's
barony
in
Scotland
.
The
new
site
was
somewhat
warmer
than
Fort_Douglas
and
much
closer
to
the
great
herds
of
buffalo
on
which
the
settlement
must
depend
for
food
.
The
Selkirk
settlers
had
been
anticipated
in
their
move
southward
by
British
fur
traders
.
For
many
years
the
Northwest_Company
had
its
southern
headquarters
at
Prairie_du_Chien
on
the
Mississippi_River
,
some
300
miles
southeast
of
present-day
St._Paul
,
Minnesota
.
When
in
1816
an
act
of
Congress
forced
the
foreign
firm
out
of
the
United_States
,
its
British
born
employees
,
now
become
American
citizens
-
Joseph_Rolette
,
Joseph_Renville
and
Alexis_Bailly
-
continued
in
the
fur
business
.
On
Big_Stone_Lake
near
the
headwaters
of
the
Red_River
,
Robert_Dickson
,
Superintendent
of
the
Western
Indian_Department
of
Canada
,
had
a
trading_post
and
planned
in
1818
to
build
a
fort
to
be
defended
by
twenty
men
and
two
small
artillery
pieces
.
His
trading
goods
came
from
Canada
to
the
Forks
of
Red_River
and
from
Selkirk's
settlement
he
brought
them
south
in
carts
.
These
carts
were
of
a
type
devised
in
Pembina
in
the
days
of
Alexander_Henry
the
Younger
about
a
decade
before
the
Selkirk
colony
was
begun
.
In
1802
Henry
referred
to
``
our
new
carts
''
as
being
about
four
feet
off
the
ground
and
carrying
five
times
as
much_as
a
horse
could
pack
.
They
were
held
together
by
pegs
and
withes
and
in
later
times
drawn
by
a
single
ox
in
thills
.
It
was
Dickson
who
suggested
to
Lord_Selkirk
that
he
return
to
the
Atlantic
coast
by
way
of
the
United_States
.
In
September
1817
at
Fort_Daer
(
Pembina
)
Dickson
met
the
noble
lord
whom
,
with
the
help
of
a
band
of
Sioux
,
he
escorted
to
Prairie_du_Chien
.
During
the
trip
Selkirk
decided
that
the
route
through
Illinois
territory
to
Indiana
and
the
eastern
United_States
was
the
best
route
for
goods
from
England
to
reach
Red_River
and
that
the
United_States
was
a
better
source
of
supply
for
many
goods
than
either
Canada
or
England
.
Upon
arriving_at
Baltimore
,
Selkirk
on
December
22
wrote
to
John_Quincy_Adams
,
Secretary_of_State
at
Washington
,
inquiring
about
laws
covering
trade
with
``
Missouri
and
Illinois_Territories
''
.
This
traffic
,
he
declared
prophetically
,
``
tho
'
it
might
be
of
small
account
at_first
,
would
increase
with
the
progress
of
our
Settlements
''
.
The
route
which
he
had
traveled
and
which
he
believed
might
develop_into
a
trade_route
was
followed
by
his
settlers
earlier
than
he
might
have
expected
.
In
1819
grasshoppers
again
destroyed
the
crop
at
``
the
Forks
''
(
Fort_Douglas
)
and
in
December
1819
,
twenty
men
left
Fort_Daer
for
the
most
northerly
American
outpost
at
Prairie_du_Chien
.
It
was
a
three
month
journey
in
the
dead
of
winter
followed
by
three
months
of
labor
on
Mackinac
boats
.
With
these
completed
and
ice
gone
from
the
St._Peter's_River
(
present-day
Minnesota
river
)
their
250
bushels
of
wheat
,
100
bushels
of
oats
and
barley
and
30
bushels
of
peas
and
some
chickens
were
loaded
onto
the
flat-bottomed
boats
and
rowed
up
the
river
to
Big_Stone_Lake
,
across
into
Lake_Traverse
,
and
down
the
Red
.
They
reached
Fort_Douglas
in
June
1820
.
This
epic
effort
to
secure
seed
for
the
colony
cost
Selkirk
1040
.
Nevertheless
so
short
was
the
supply
of
seed
that
the
settlers
were
forced
to
retreat
to
Fort_Daer
for
food
.
Thereafter
seed
and
food
became
more
plentiful
and
the
colony
remained
in
the
north
the
year
round
.
Activity
by
British
traders
and
the
presence
of
a
colony
on
the
Red
prompted
the
United_State
War_Department
in
1819
to
send
Lieutenant-Colonel_Henry_Leavenworth
from
Detroit
to
put
a
post
300
miles
northwest
of
Prairie_du_Chien
,
until
then
the
most
advanced
United_States
post
.
In
September
1822
two
companies
of
infantry
arrived_at
the
mouth
of
the
St._Peter's_River
,
the
head
of
navigation
on
the
Mississippi
,
and
began
construction
of
Fort_St._Anthony
which
,
upon
completion
,
was
renamed
in_honor_of
its
commander
,
Colonel_Josiah_Snelling
.
It
was
from
the
American
outposts
that
Red_River
shortages
of
livestock
were
to
be
made
good
.
Hercules_L._Dousman
,
fur
trader
and
merchant
at
Prairie_du_Chien
,
contracted
to
supply
Selkirk
's
people
with
some
300
head
of
cattle
,
and
Alexis_Bailly
and
Francois_Labothe
were
hired
as
drovers
.
Bailly
,
after
leaving
Fort_Snelling
in
August
1821
,
was
forced
to
leave
some
of
the
cattle
at
the
Hudson's_Bay_Company's
post
on
Lake_Traverse
``
in
the
Sieux_Country
''
and
reached
Fort_Garry
,
as
the
Selkirk
Hudson's_Bay_Company
center
was
now
called
,
late
in
the
fall
.
He
set_out
on
his
700
-
mile
return
journey
with
five
families
of
discontented
and
disappointed
Swiss
who
turned
their
eyes
toward
the
United_States
.
Observing
their
distressing
condition
,
Colonel_Snelling
allowed
these
half
starved
immigrants
to
settle
on
the
military
reservation
.
As
these
Swiss
were
moving
from
the
Selkirk
settlement
to
become
the
first
civilian
residents
of
Minnesota
,
Dousman
of
Michilimackinac
,
Michigan
,
and
Prairie_du_Chien
was
traveling_to
Red_River
to
open
a
trade
in
merchandise
.
Early
in
1822
he
was
at
Fort_Garry
offering
to
bring_in
pork
,
flour
,
liquor
and
tobacco
.
Alexander_McDonnell
,
governor
of
Red_River
,
and
James_Bird
,
a
chief
factor
of
the
Hudson's_Bay_Company
,
ordered
such
``
sundry
articles
''
to
a
value
of
4500
.
For
its
part
the
Hudson's_Bay_Company
was
troubled
by
the
approach
of
American
settlement
.
As
the
time
drew_near
for
the
drawing
of
the
British
American
frontier
by
terms
of
the
agreement
of
1818
,
the
company
suspected
that
the
Pembina_colony
-
its
own
post
and
Fort_Daer
-
was
on
American
territory
.
Accordingly
Selkirk
's
agents
ordered
the
settlers
to
move
north
,
and
by
October
,
John_Halkett
had
torn_down
both
posts
,
floating
the
timber
to
``
the
Forks
''
in
rafts
.
``
I
have
done
everything
''
,
he
wrote
,
``
to
break_up
the
whole
of
that
unfortunate
establishment
''
.
Despite
Company
threats
,
duly
carried_through
,
to
cut_off
supplies
of
powder
,
ball
,
and
thread
for
fishing_nets
,
about
350
persons
stayed
in
the
village
.
They
would
attempt
to
bring
supplies
from
St._Louis
or
Prairie_du_Chien
at
``
great
expense
as
well
as
danger
''
.
At
Fort_Garry
some
of
the_Swiss
also
decided
to
cast
their
lot
with
the
United_States
,
and
in
1823
several
families
paid
guides
to
take
them
to
Fort_Snelling
.
The
disasters
of
1825
-
1826
caused
more
to
leave
.
After
heavy
rains
and
an
onslaught
of
mice
,
snow
fell
on
October
15
,
1825
,
and
remained
on
the
ground
through
a
winter
so
cold
that
the
ice
on
the
Red
was
five
feet
thick
.
In
April
came
a
rapid
thaw
that
produced
high
waters
which
did
not
recede
until
mid-June
.
On
June
24
more
than
400
families
started
the
three
month
trip
across
the
plains
to
the
Mississippi
.
By
fall
,
443
survivors
of
this
arduous
journey
were
clustered
about
Fort_Snelling
,
but
most_of
them
were
sent_on
to
Galena
and
St._Louis
,
with
a
few
going
as
far
as
Vevay
,
Indiana
,
a
notable
Swiss
center
in
the
United_States
.
In
1837
,
157
Red_River
people
with
more
than
200
cattle
were
living
on
the
reservation
at
Fort_Snelling
.
Below
the
fort
,
high
bluffs
extended
uninterruptedly
for
six
miles
along
the
Mississippi_River
.
At
the
point
where
they
ended
,
another
settlement
grew
up
around
a
chapel
built
at
the
boat
landing
by
Father_Lucian_Galtier
in
1840
.
Its
people
,
including
Pierre_Bottineau
and
other
American_Fur_Company
employees
and
the
refugees
from
Fort_Garry
,
were
joined
by
the
remaining
Scots
and
Swiss
from
Fort_Snelling
when
Major_Joseph_Plympton
expelled
them
from
the
reservation
in
May
1840
.
The
resultant
town
,
platted
in
1847
and
named
for
the
patron
of
Father_Galtier
's
mission
,
St._Paul
,
was
to
become
an
important
center
of
the
fur
trade
and
was
to
take_on
a
new
interest
for
those
Selkirkers
who
remained
at
Red_River
.
While
population
at
Fort_Garry
increased
rapidly
,
from
2417
in
1831
to
4369
in
1840
,
economic
opportunities
did
not
increase
at
a
similar
rate
.
Accordingly
,
though
the
practice
violated
the
no
trading
provision
of
the
Selkirk
charter
which
reserved
all
such
activity
in
merchandise
and
furs
to
the
Hudson's_Bay_Company
,
some
settlers
went
into
trade
.
The
Company
maintained
a
store
at
which
products
of
England
could
be
purchased
and
brought_in
goods
for
the
new
merchants
on
the
understanding
that
they
refrain_from
trading
in
furs
.
Despite
this
prohibiton
,
by
1844
some
of
the
Fort_Garry
merchants
were
trading
with
the
Indians
for
furs
.
In
June
1845
,
the
Governor
and
Council
of
Assiniboia
imposed
a
20
per_cent
duty
on
imports
via
Hudson's_Bay
which
were
viewed_as
aimed
at
the
``
very
vitals
of
the
Company
's
trade
and
power
''
.
To
reduce
further
the
flow
of
goods
from
England
,
the
Company
's
local
officials
asked
that
its
London
authorities
refrain_from
forwarding
any
more
trade
goods
to
these
men
.
With
their
customary
source
of
supply
cut_off
,
the
Fort_Garry
free_traders
engaged
three
men
to
cart
goods
to
them
from
the
Mississippi
country
.
Others
carried
pemmican
from
``
the
Forks
''
to
St._Paul
and
goods
from
St._Paul
to
Red_River
,
as
in
the
summer
of
1847
when
one
trader
,
Wells
,
transported
twenty
barrels
of
whisky
to
the
British
settlement
.
This
trade
was
subject
to
a
tariff
of
7.5
per_cent
after
February
1835
,
but
much
was
smuggled
into
Assiniboia
with
the
result
that
the
duty
was
reduced
by
1841
to
4
per_cent
on
the
initiative
of
the
London
committee
.
The
trade
in
a_few
commodities
noted
above
was
to
grow
in
volume
as
a
result
of
changes
both
north
and
south
of
the
49
th
parallel
.
