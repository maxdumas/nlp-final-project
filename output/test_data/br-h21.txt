Strategy
and
tactics
of
the
U._S.
military_forces
are
now
undergoing
one
of
the
greatest
transitions
in
history
.
The
change
of
emphasis
from
conventional
type
to
missile
type
warfare
must
be
made
with
care
,
mindful
that
the
one
type
of
warfare
cannot
be
safely
neglected
in
favor
of
the
other
.
Our
military_forces
must
be
capable
of
contending
successfully
with
any
contingency
which
may
be
forced
upon
us
,
from
limited
emergencies
to
all-out
nuclear
general
war
.
-
This
budget
will
provide
in
the
fiscal_year
1961
for
the
continued
support
of
our
forces
at
approximately
the
present
level
-
a
year-end
strength
of
2489000
men
and
women
in
the
active
forces
.
The
forces
to
be
supported
include
an
Army
of
14
divisions
and
870000
men
;
a
Navy
of
817
active
ships
and
619000
men
;
a
Marine_Corps
of
3
divisions
and
3
air
wings
with
175000
men
;
and
an
Air_Force
of
91
combat
wings
and
825000
men
.
If
the
reserve
components
are
to
serve
effectively
in
time
of
war
,
their
basic
organization
and
objectives
must
conform_to
the
changing
character
and
missions
of
the
active
forces
.
Quality
and
combat
readiness
must
take
precedence
over
mere
numbers
.
Under
modern
conditions
,
this
is
especially
true
of
the
ready
reserve
.
I
have
requested
the
Secretary
of
Defense
to
reexamine
the
roles
and
missions
of
the
reserve
components
in_relation_to
those
of
the
active
forces
and
in
the
light
of
the
changing
requirements
of
modern
warfare
.
Last
year
the
Congress
discontinued
its
previously
imposed
minimum
personnel
strength
limitations
on
the
Army_Reserve
.
Similar
restrictions
on
the
strength
of
the
Army
National_Guard
contained
in
the
1960
Department_of_Defense
Appropriation_Act
should
likewise
be
dropped
.
I
strongly
recommend
to
the
Congress
the
avoidance
of
mandatory
floors
on
the
size
of
the
reserve
components
so
that
we
may
have
the
flexibility
to
make
adjustments
in
keeping
with
military
necessity
.
I
again
proposed
a
reduction
in
the
Army
National_Guard
and
Army_Reserve
-
from
their
present
strengths
of
400000
and
300000
,
respectively
,
to
360000
and
270000
by
the
end
of
the
fiscal_year
1961
.
These
strengths
are
considered
adequate
to
meet
the
essential
roles
and
missions
of
the
reserves
in
support
of
our
national
security
objectives
.
-
About
30
%
of
the
expenditures
for
the
Department_of_Defense
in
1961
are
for
military_personnel
costs
,
including
pay
for
active
,
reserve
,
and
retired
military_personnel
.
These
expenditures
are
estimated
to
be
$
12.1
billion
,
an
increase
of
$
187
million
over
1960
,
reflecting
additional
longevity
pay
of
career
personnel
,
more
dependents
,
an
increased
number
of
men
drawing
proficiency
pay
,
and
social_security
tax
increases
(
effective
for
the
full
year
in
1961
compared
with
only
6
months
in
1960
)
.
Retired
pay
costs
are
increased
by
$
94
million
in
1961
over
1960
,
partly
because
of
a
substantial
increase
in
the
number
of
retired
personnel
.
These
increased
costs
are
partially
offset
by
a
decrease
of
$
56
million
in
expenditures
for
the
reserve
forces
,
largely
because
of
the
planned
reduction
in
strength
of
the
Army_Reserve
components
during
1961
.
Traditionally
,
rates_of_pay
for
retired
military_personnel
have
been
proportionate
to
current
rates_of_pay
for
active
personnel
.
The
1958
military
pay
act
departed
from
this
established
formula
by
providing_for
a
6
%
increase
rather
than
a
proportionate
increase
for
everyone
retired
prior
to
its
effective
date
of
June
1
,
1958
.
I
endorse
pending
legislation
that
will
restore
the
traditional
relationship
between
retired
and
active
duty
pay_rates
.
-
Expenditures
for
operating
and
maintaining
the
stations
and
equipment
of
the
Armed_Forces
are
estimated
to
be
$
10.3
billion
in
1961
,
which
is
$
184
million
more
than
in
1960
.
The
increase
stems
largely
from
the
growing
complexity
of
and
higher
degree
of
maintenance
required
for
newer
weapons
and
equipment
.
A
substantial
increase
is
estimated
in
the
cost
of
operating
additional
communications_systems
in
the
air
defense_program
,
as_well
as
in
all
programs
where
speed
and
security
of
communications
are
essential
.
Also
,
the
program
for
fleet
modernization
will
be
stepped_up
in
1961
causing
an
increase
in
expenditures
.
Further
increases
arise
from
the
civilian
employee
health
program
enacted
by
the
Congress
last
year
.
Other
factors
increasing
operating_costs
include
the
higher
unit_cost
of
each
flying
hour
,
up
11
%
in
two
years
,
and
of
each
steaming
hour
,
up
15
%
.
In
total
,
these
increases
in
operating_costs
outweigh
the
savings
that
result
from
declining
programs
and
from
economy
measures
,
such_as
reduced
numbers
of
units
and
installations
,
smaller
inventories
of
major
equipment
,
and
improvements
in
the
supply
and
distribution
systems
of
the
Armed_Forces
.
In
the
budget
message
for
1959
,
and
again
for
1960
,
I
recommended
immediate
repeal
of
section
601
of
the
Act
of
September
28
,
1951
(
65
Stat.
365
)
.
This
section
prevents
the
military
departments
and
the
Office
of
Civil
and
Defense
Mobilization
from
carrying_out
certain
transactions
involving
real_property
unless
they
come
into
agreement
with
the
Committees_on_Armed_Services
of
the
Senate
and
the
House_of_Representatives
.
As
I
have
stated
previously
,
the
Attorney_General
has
advised
me
that
this
section
violates
fundamental
constitutional
principles
.
Accordingly
,
if
it
is
not
repealed
by
the
Congress
at
its
present
session
,
I
shall
have
no
alternative
thereafter
but
to
direct
the
Secretary
of
Defense
to
disregard
the
section
unless
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
determines
otherwise
.
Basic
long
line
communications
in
Alaska
are
now
provided
through
Federal
facilities
operated
by
the
Army
,
Air_Force
,
and
Federal_Aviation_Agency
.
The
growing
communications
needs
of
this
new
State
can
best
be
met
,
as
they
have
in
other
States
,
through
the
operation
and
development
of
such
facilities
by
private
enterprise
.
Legislation
has
already
been
proposed
to
authorize
the
sale
of
these
Government
owned
systems
in
Alaska
,
and
its
early
enactment
is
desirable
.
-
Approximately
45
%
of
the
expenditures
for
the
Department_of_Defense
are
for
procurement
,
research
,
development
,
and
construction
programs
.
In
1961
,
these
expenditures
are
estimated
at
$
18.9
billion
,
compared
to
$
19.3
billion
in
1960
.
The
decreases
,
which
are
largely
in
construction
and
in
aircraft
procurement
,
are
offset
in
part
by
increases
for
research
and
development
and
for
procurement
of
other
military
equipment
such_as
tanks
,
vehicles
,
guns
,
and
electronic_devices
.
Expenditures
for
shipbuilding
are
estimated
at
about
the
same
level
as
in
1960
.
New
obligational
authority
for
1961
recommended
in
this
budget
for
aircraft
procurement
(
excluding
amounts
for
related
research
and
construction
)
totals
$
4753
million
,
which
is
$
1390
million
below
that
enacted
for
1960
.
On_the_other_hand
,
the
new
authority
of
$
3825
million
proposed
for
missile
procurement
(
excluding
research
and
construction
)
in
1961
is
$
581
million
higher
than
for
1960
.
These
contrasting
trends
in
procurement
reflect
the
anticipated
changes
in
the
composition
and
missions
of
our
Armed_Forces
in
the
years
ahead
.
The
Department_of_Defense
appropriation
acts
for
the
past
several
years
have
contained
a
rider
which
limits
competitive
bidding
by
firms
in
other
countries
on
certain
military
supply
items
.
As
I
have
repeatedly
stated
,
this
provision
is
much
more
restrictive
than
the
general
law
,
popularly
known_as
the
Buy
American
Act
.
I
urge
once_again
that
the
Congress
not
reenact
this
rider
.
The
task
of
providing
a
reasonable
level
of
military
strength
,
without
endangering
other
vital
aspects
of
our
security
,
is
greatly
complicated
by
the
swift
pace
of
scientific
progress
.
The
last
few
years
have
witnessed
what
have
been
perhaps
the
most
rapid
advances
in
military
technology
in
history
.
Some
weapons_systems
have
become
obsolescent
while
still
in
production
,
and
some
while
still
under
development
.
Furthermore
,
unexpectedly
rapid
progress
or
a
technological
break-through
on
any
one
weapon_system
,
in
itself
,
often
diminishes
the
relative
importance
of
other
competitive
systems
.
This
has
necessitated
a
continuous
review
and
reevaluation
of
the
defense_program
in_order
to
redirect
resources
to
the
newer
and
more
important
weapons_systems
and
to
eliminate
or
reduce
effort
on
weapons_systems
which
have
been
overtaken
by
events
.
Thus
,
in
the
last
few
years
,
a
number
of
programs
which
looked
very
promising
at
the
time
their
development
was
commenced
have
since
been
completely
eliminated
.
For_example
,
the
importance
of
the
Regulus_2
,
,
a
very
promising
aerodynamic
ship
to
surface
missile
designed
to
be
launched
by
surfaced
submarines
,
was
greatly
diminished
by
the
successful
acceleration
of
the
much
more
advanced
Polaris
ballistic_missile
launched
by
submerged
submarines
.
Another
example
is
the
recent
cancellation
of
the
F-108
,
a
long
range
interceptor
with
a
speed
three_times
as
great
as
the
speed
of
sound
,
which
was
designed
for
use
against
manned
bombers
in
the
period
of
the
mid
1960
's
.
The
substantial
progress
being
made
in
ballistic_missile
technology
is
rapidly
shifting
the
main
threat
from
manned
bombers
to
missiles
.
Considering
the
high
cost
of
the
F-108
system
-
over
$
4
billion
for
the
force
that
had
been
planned
-
and
the
time_period
in
which
it
would
become
operational
,
it
was
decided
to
stop
further
work
on
the
project
.
Meanwhile
,
other
air_defense
forces
are
being
made
effective
,
as
described
later
in
this
message
.
The
size
and
scope
of
other
important
programs
have
been
reduced
from
earlier
plans
.
Notable
in
this
category
are
the
Jupiter
and
Thor
intermediate
range
ballistic_missiles
,
which
have
been
successfully
developed
,
produced
,
and
deployed
,
but
the
relative
importance
of
which
has
diminished
with
the
increasing
availability
of
the
Atlas
intercontinental_ballistic_missile
.
The
impact
of
technological
factors
is
also
illustrated
by
the
history
of
the
high
energy
fuel
program
.
This
project
was
started
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
critical
need
for
a
high
energy
fuel
to
provide
an
extra
margin
of
range
for
high
performance
aircraft
,
particularly
our
heavy
bombers
.
Continuing
technical
problems
involved
in
the
use
of
this
fuel
,
coupled
with
significant
improvements
in
aircraft
range
through
other
means
,
have
now
raised
serious
questions
about
the
value
of
the
high
energy
fuel
program
.
As
a
result
,
the
scope
of
this
project
has
been
sharply
curtailed
.
These
examples
underscore
the
importance
of
even
more
searching
evaluations
of
new
major
development
programs
and
even
more
penetrating
and
far
ranging
analyses
of
the
potentialities
of
future
technology
.
The
cost
of
developing
a
major
weapon_system
is
now
so
enormous
that
the
greatest
care
must
be
exercised
in
selecting
new
systems
for
development
,
in
determining
the
most
satisfactory
rate
of
development
,
and
in
deciding
the
proper
time
at
which
either
to
place
a
system
into
production
or
to
abandon
it
.
-
The
deterrent
power
of
our
Armed_Forces
comes
from
both
their
nuclear
retaliatory
capability
and
their
capability
to
conduct
other
essential
operations
in
any
form
of
war
.
The
first
capability
is
represented
by
a
combination
of
manned
bombers
,
carrier
based
aircraft
,
and
intercontinental
and
intermediate
range
missiles
.
The
second
capability
is
represented
by
our
deployed
ground
,
naval
,
and
air
forces
in
essential
forward
areas
,
together
with
ready
reserves
capable
of
effecting
early
emergency
reinforcement
.
The
Strategic_Air_Command
is
the
principal
element
of
our
long_range
nuclear
capability
.
One
of
the
important
and
difficult
decisions
which
had
to
be
made
in
this
budget
concerned
the
role
of
the
B-70
,
a
long
range
supersonic
bomber
.
This
aircraft
,
which
was
planned
for
initial
operational
use
about
1965
,
would
be
complementary
to
but
likewise
competitive
with
the
four
strategic
ballistic_missile
systems
,
all_of
which
are
scheduled
to
become
available
earlier
.
The
first
Atlas
ICBM
's
are
now
operational
,
the
first
two
Polaris
submarines
are
expected
to
be
operational
this
calendar_year
,
and
the
first
Titan
ICBM
's
next
year
.
The
Minuteman
solid
fueled
ICBM
is
planned
to
be
operational
about
mid
1963
.
By
1965
,
several
or
all_of
these
systems
will
have
been
fully
tested
and
their
reliability
established
.
Thus
,
the
need
for
the
B-70
as
a
strategic
weapon_system
is
doubtful
.
However
,
I
am
recommending
that
development
work
on
the
B-70
air-frame
and
engines
be
continued
.
It
is
expected
that
in
1963
two
prototype
aircraft
will
be
available
for
flight
testing
.
By
that
time
we
should
be
in
a
much
better
position
to
determine
the
value
of
that
aircraft
as
a
weapon_system
.
I
am
recommending
additional
acquisitions
of
the
improved
version
of
the
B-52
(
the
B-52_H
with
the
new
turbofan_engine
)
and
procurement
of
the
B-58
supersonic
medium
bomber
,
together
with
the
supporting
refueling
tankers
in
each
case
.
These
additional
modern
bombers
will
replace
some
of
the
older
B-47
medium
bombers
;
one
B-52
can
do
the
work
of
several
B-47
's
which
it
will
replace
.
Funds
are
also
included
in
this
budget
to
continue
the
equipping
of
the
B-52
wings
with
the
Hound_Dog
air-to-surface_missile
.
In
the
coming
fiscal_year
additional
quantities
of
Atlas
,
Titan
,
and
Polaris
missiles
also
will
be
procured
.
