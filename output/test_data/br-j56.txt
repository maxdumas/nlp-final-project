The
plant
was
located
west
of
the
Battenkill
and
south
of
the
location
of
the
former
electric_light
plant
.
The
Manchester_Depot_Sewer_Company
issued
214
shares
of
stock
at
$
10
each
for
construction
of
a
sewer
in
that
locality
,
and
assessments
were
made
for
its
maintenance
.
It
has
given
considerable
trouble
at_times
and
empties
right
into
the
Battenkill
.
Fire_District_No._1
discussed
its
possible
purchase
in
1945
,
but
considered
it
an
unwise
investment
.
The
sewer
on
Bonnet_Street
was
constructed
when
there
were
only
a_few
houses
on
the
street
.
as
new
homes
were
built
they
were
connected
so
that
all
residences
south
of
School_Street
are
served
by
it
.
B._J._Connell
is
the
present
treasurer
and
manager
.
The
1946
town_meeting
voted
to
have
the
Selectmen
appoint
a
committee
to
investigate
and
report
on
the
feasibility
of
some
system
of
sewage_disposal
and
a
disposal_plant
to
serve
Manchester_Center
,
Depot
,
and
Way_'s_Lane
.
The
committee
submitted
a
report
signed
by
Louis_Martin
and
Leon_Wiley
with
a
map
published
in
the
1946
town
report
.
The
layout
of
the
sewer_lines
was
designed
by
Henry_W._Taylor
,
who
was
the
engineer
for
the
Manchester_Village
disposal_plant
.
No
figures
were
submitted
with
the
report
and
no
action
was
taken
on
it
by
the
town
.
The
1958
town_meeting
directed
town
authorities
to
seek
federal
and
state
funds
with
which
to
conduct
a
preliminary
survey
of
a
proposed
sewage
plant
with
its
attendant
facilities
.
The
final
step
was
a
vote
for
a
$
230000
bond
issue
for
the
construction
of
a
sewage_system
by
the
1959
town_meeting
,
later
confirmed
by
a
two-thirds
vote
at
a
special
town_meeting
June_21
,
1960
.
There
the
matter
stands
with
the
prospect
that
soon
Manchester
may
be
removed
from
the
roster
of
towns
contributing
raw
sewage
to
its
main
streams
.
Manchester
's
unusual
interest
in
telegraphy
has
often
been
attributed
to
the
fact
that
the
Rev._J._D._Wickham
,
headmaster
of
Burr
and
Burton_Seminary
,
was
a
personal
friend
and
correspondent
of
the
inventor
,
Samuel_F._B._Morse
.
At_any_rate
,
Manchester
did
not
lag
far
behind
the
first
commercial
system
which
was
set_up
in
1844
between
Baltimore
and
Washington
.
In
1846
Matthew_B._Goodwin
,
jeweler
and
watchmaker
,
became
the
town
's
first
telegrapher
in
a
dwelling
he
built
for
himself
and
his
business
``
two
doors
north
of
the
Equinox_House
''
or
``
one
door
north
of
the
Bank
,
Manchester
,
Vermont
''
.
Goodwin
was
telegrapher
for
the
``
American_Telegraph_Company
''
and
the
``
Troy_and_Canada_Junction_Telegraph_Company
''
.
Shares
of
capital_stock
at
$
15
each
in
the
latter
company
were
payable
at
the
Bank_of_Manchester
or
at
various
other
Vermont
banks
.
A
message
of
less_than
fifteen
words
to
Bennington
cost
twenty-five
cents
.
By
1871
L._C._Orvis
,
manager
of
the
``
Western_Union_Telegraph_Company
''
,
expressed
willingness
to
send
emergency
telegrams
on
Sundays
from
his
Village
drugstore
.
Orvis
even
needed
to
hire
an
assistant
,
Clark_J._Wait
.
The
Manchester_Journal
commented
editorially
on
the
surprising
amount
of
local
telegraphic
business
.
In
the
fall
of
1878
,
the
``
Popular_Telegraph_Line
''
was
established
between
Manchester
and
Factory_Point
by
the
owners
,
Paul_W._Orvis
,
Henry_Gray
,
J._N._Hard
,
and
Clark_J._Wait
.
The
line
soon
lived_up_to
its
name
,
as
local
messages
of
moderate
length
could
be
sent
for
a
dime
and
the
company
was
quickly
able
to
declare
very
liberal
dividends
on
its
capital_stock
.
In
1879
the
same
Clark_Wait
,
with
H._H._Holley
of
South_Dorset
,
formed
the
``
American_Telegraph_Line
''
,
extending
from
Manchester_Depot
via
Factory_Point
and
South_Dorset
to
Dorset
.
Besides
being
most
convenient
,
the
line
``
soon
proved
a
good
investment
for
the
owners
''
.
Telegraphers
at
the
Depot
at
this
time
were
Aaron_C._Burr
and
Mark_Manley
of
``
Burr_and_Manley
''
,
dealers
in
lumber
and
dry_goods
.
Early
equipment
was
very
flimsy
;
the
smallest
gusts
of
wind
toppled
poles
,
making
communications
impossible
.
But
companies
continued
to
spring_up
.
By
1883
the
``
Battenkill_Telegraph_Company
''
was
in
existence
and
Alvin_Pettibone
was
its
president
.
Operating
in
1887
was
the
``
Valley_Telegraph_Line
''
,
officers
of
which
were
E._C._Orvis
,
president
;
H._K._Fowler
,
vice-president
and
secretary
;
J._N._Hard
,
treasurer
;
F._H._Walker
,
superintendent
;
H._S._Walker
,
assistant
superintendent
.
Two
companies
now
had
headquarters
with
Clark_J._Wait
,
who
by
then
had
his
own
drugstore
at
Factory_Point
-
the
``
Northern_Union_Telegraph_Company
''
and
the
``
Western_Union
''
.
Operators
were
Arthur_Koop
and
Norman_Taylor
.
Still
existing
on
a
``
Northern_Union
''
telegraph_form
is
a
typical
peremptory
message
from
Peru
grocer
J._J._Hapgood
to
Burton
and
Graves
'
store
in
Manchester
-
``
Get
and
send
by
stage
sure
four
pounds
best
Porterhouse
or
sirloin
steak
,
for
Mrs._Hapgood
send
six
sweet_oranges
''
.
About
1888
J._E._McNaughton
of
Barnumville
and
E._G._Bacon
became
proprietors
of
the
``
Green_Mountain_Telegraph_Company
''
,
connecting
all
offices
on
the
Western_Union
line
and
extending
over
the
mountain
from
Barnumville
to
Peru
,
Londonderry
,
South_Londonderry
,
Lowell_Lake
,
Windham
,
North_Windham
,
Grafton
,
Cambridgeport
,
Saxton_'s_River
,
and
Bellows_Falls
.
From
1896
until
1910
John_H._Whipple
was
manager
of
Western_Union
at
the
Center
in
the
drugstore
he
purchased
from
Clark_Wait
.
The
Village
office
of
Western_Union
with
George_Towsley
as
manager
and
telegrapher
continued
in
Hard
's
drugstore
until
1905
.
During
the
summers
,
Towsley
often
needed
the
assistance
of
a
company_operator
.
These
were
the
years
when
people
flocked
to
Manchester
not_only
to
play
golf
,
which
had
come
into
vogue
,
but
also
to
witness
the
Ekwanok
Country_Club
tournaments
.
New_Yorkers
were
kept
informed
of
scores
by
reporters
who
telegraphed
fifteen
to
twenty
thousand
words
daily
to
the
metropolitan
newspapers
.
This
boosted
local
telegraph
business
and
Manchester
basked
in
all
the
free
advertising
.
In
1914
when
the
town
was
chosen
for
the
U._S._Amateur_Golf
tournament
,
a
representative
hurried
here
from
the
Boston
manager
's
office
.
In
his
wake
came
the
District_Traffic_Supervisor
and
the
cream
of
the
telegraphic
profession
,
ten
of
Boston
's
best
,
chosen
for
their
long
experience
and
thorough
knowledge
of
golf
.
During
that
tournament
alone
,
some
250000
words
winged
their
way
out
of
Manchester
.
The
old
Morse
system
was
replaced
locally
by
the
Simplex
modern
automatic
method
in
1929
,
when
Ellamae_Heckman
(
Wilcox
)
was
manager
of
the
Western_Union
office
.
During
summers
,
business
was
so
brisk
that
Mrs._Wilcox
had
two
assistants
and
a
messenger
.
She
was
succeeded
by
Clarence_Goyette
.
Since
that
time
the
telegraph
office
has
shifted
in
location
from
the
railroad_station
at
the
Depot
and
shops
at
the
Center
back
to
the
town_clerk
's
office
and
drugstore
at
the
Village
.
After
being
located
for
some
years
in
the
Village
at
the
Equinox_Pharmacy
under
the
supervision
of
Mrs._Harry_Mercier
,
it
is
presently
located
in
the
Hill_and_Dale_Shop
,
Manchester_Center
.
The
first
known
telephone_line
in
Manchester
was
established
in
July
1883
between
Burr
and
Manley
's
store
at
Manchester_Depot
and
the
Kent_and_Root_Marble_Company
in
South_Dorset
.
This
was
extended
the
following
year
to
include
the
railroad_station
agent
's
office
and
Thayer
's
Hotel
at
Factory_Point
.
In
November
1887
a
line
connecting
several
dwelling_houses
in
Dorset
was
extended
to
Manchester_Depot
.
Telephone_wires
from
Louis_Dufresne
's
house
in
East_Manchester
to
the
Dufresne
lumber
job
near
Bourn_Pond
were
up
about
1895
.
Eber_L._Taylor
of
Manchester_Depot
recorded
the
setting
of
phone
poles
in
East_Dorset
and
Barnumville
in
his
diary
for
1906
.
These
must
have
been
for
local_calls
strictly
,
as
in
May
1900
the
``
only
long
distance
telephone
''
in
town
was
transferred
from
C._B._Carleton
's
to
Young
's
shoe_store
.
A
small
single
switchboard
was
installed
in
the
Village
over
Woodcock
's
hardware_store
(
later
E._H._Hemenway
's
)
.
George_Woodcock
was
manager
and
troubleshooter
;
Elizabeth_Way
was
the
first
operator
;
and
a
night
operator
was
also
employed
.
Anyone
fortunate
enough
to
have
one
of
those
early
phones
advertised
the
fact
along
with
the
telephone_number
in
the
Manchester_Journal
.
In
1918
the
New_England_Telephone_Company
began
erecting
a
building
to
house
its
operations
on
the
corner
of
U._S._Rte._7
and
what
is
now
Memorial_Avenue
at
Manchester_Center
.
Service
running
through
Barnumville
and
to
Bennington_County
towns
east
of
the
mountains
was
in
the
hands
of
the
``
Gleason_Telephone_Company
''
in
1925
,
but
major
supervision
of
telephone_lines
in
Manchester
was
with
the
New_England_Telephone_and_Telegraph_Company
,
which
eventually
gained
all
control
.
More
aerial
and
underground
equipment
was
installed
as_well
as
office
improvements
to
take_care
of
the
expanding
business
.
In
1931
Mrs._F._H._Briggs
,
agent
and
chief
operator
,
who
was
to
retire
in
1946
with
thirty
years
'
service
,
led
agency
offices
in
sales
for
the
year
with
$
2490
.
William_Hitchcock
,
who
retired
in
1938
,
was
a
veteran
of
thirty-four
years
'
local
service
.
Another
veteran
telephone_operator
was
Edith_Fleming_Blackmer
,
who
had
been
in
the
office
forty
years
at
the
time
of
her
death
in
1960
.
In
1932
Dorset
received
its
own
exchange
,
which
made
business
easier
for
the
Manchester
office
,
but
it
was
not
until
February
1953
that
area
service
was
extended
to
include
Manchester
and
Dorset
.
This
eliminated
toll_calls
between
the
two
towns
.
Within
a
month
,
calls
were
up
seventy
per_cent
.
Electricity
plays
such
an
important
part
in
community
life
today
that
it
is
difficult
to
envision
a
time
when
current
was
not
available
for
daily
use
.
Yet
one
has
to
go_back
only
some
sixty
years
.
The
first
mention
of
an
electric
plant
in
Manchester
seems
to
be
one
installed
in
Reuben_Colvin
's
and
Houghton
's
gristmill
on
the
West_Branch
in
Factory_Point
.
No
records
are
available
as_to
the
date
or
extent
of
installation
,
but
it
may
have
been
in
1896
.
On
June_14
,
1900
the
Manchester_Journal
reported
that
an
electrical_engineer
was
installing
an
electric_light
plant
for
Edward_S._Isham
at
``
Ormsby_Hill
''
.
This
was
working
by
the
end
of
August
and
giving
satisfactory
service
.
In
November
1900
surveying
was
done
under
John_Marsden
on
the
east
mountains
to
ascertain
if
it
would
be
possible
to
get
sufficient
water
and
fall
to
operate
an
electric
power_plant
.
Nothing
came
of
it
,
perhaps
due_to
lack
of
opportunity
for
water
storage
.
The
next
step
was
construction
by
the
Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company
of
a
plant
on
the
west
bank
of
the
Battenkill
south
of
Union_Street
bridge
.
This
was
nearly
completed
May
23
,
1901
with
a
promise
of
lights
by
June
10
,
but
the
first
light
did
not
go_on
until
September
28
.
It
was
at
the
end
of
the
sidewalk
in_front
of
the
Dellwood_Cemetery
cottage
.
The
first
directors
of
the
Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company
were
John_Marsden
,
M._L._Manley
,
William_F._Orvis
,
George_Smith
,
and
John_Blackmer
.
The
officers
were
John_Marsden
,
president
;
John_C._Blackmer
,
vice-president
;
George_Smith
,
treasurer
;
and
William_F._Orvis
,
secretary
.
Marsden
was
manager
of
the
company
for
ten
years
and
manager
of
its
successor
company
,
the
Colonial_Light_and_Power_Company
,
for
one
year
.
At
about
the
time
the
Marsden
enterprise
was
getting
under_way
,
the
Vail_Light_and_Lumber_Company
started
construction
of
a
chair
stock
factory
on
the
site
of
the
present
Bennington_Co-operative_Creamery
,
intending
to
use
its
surplus
power
for
generating
electricity
.
Manchester
then
had
two
competing
power_companies
until
1904
,
when
the
Manchester_Light_and_Power_Company
purchased
the
transmission
system
of
the
Vail_Company
.
This
was
fortunate
,
as
the
Vail
plant
burned
in
1905
.
The
Colonial_Light_and_Power_Company
was
succeeded
by
the
Vermont_Hydro-Electric_Corporation
,
which
in_turn
was
absorbed
by
the
Central_Vermont_Public_Service_Corporation
.
The
latter
now
furnishes
the
area
with
electricity
distributed
from
a
modern
sub-station
at
Manchester_Depot
which
was
put
into
operation
February
19
,
1930
and
was
improved
in
January
1942
by
the
installation
of
larger
transformers
.
For
a
time
following
the
abandonment
of
the
local
plant
,
electric_current
for
Manchester
was
brought_in
from
the
south
with
an
emergency
tie-in
with
the
Vermont_Marble_Company
system
to_the_north
.
