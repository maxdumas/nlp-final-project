She
lived
and
was
given
a
name
.
Helva
.
For
her
first
three
vegetable
months
she
waved
her
crabbed
claws
,
kicked
weakly
with
her
clubbed
feet
and
enjoyed
the
usual
routine
of
the
infant
.
She
was
not
alone
for
there
were
three
other
such
children
in
the
big
city
's
special
nursery
.
Soon
they
all
were
removed
to
Central_Laboratory_School
where
their
delicate
transformation
began
.
One
of
the
babies
died
in
the
initial
transferral
but
of
Helva
's
``
class
''
,
seventeen
thrived
in
the
metal
shells
.
Instead
of
kicking
feet
,
Helva
's
neural
responses
started
her
wheels
;
instead
of
grabbing
with
hands
,
she
manipulated
mechanical
extensions
.
As
she
matured
,
more_and_more
neural
synapses
would
be
adjusted
to
operate
other
mechanisms
that
went_into
the
maintenance
and
running
of
a
space
ship
.
For
Helva
was
destined
to
be
the
``
brain
''
half
of
a
scout
ship
,
partnered
with
a
man
or
a
woman
,
whichever
she
chose
,
as
the
mobile
half
.
She
would
be
among
the
elite
of
her
kind
.
Her
initial
intelligence_tests
registered
above
normal
and
her
adaptation
index
was
unusually
high
.
As
long
as
her
development
within
her
shell
lived_up_to
expectations
,
and
there
were
no
side-effects
from
the
pituitary
tinkering
,
Helva
would
live
a
rewarding
,
rich
and
unusual
life
,
a
far
cry
from
what
she
would
have
faced
as
an
ordinary
,
``
normal
''
being
.
However
,
no
diagram
of
her
brain
patterns
,
no
early
I._Q.
tests
recorded
certain
essential
facts
about
Helva
that
Central
must
eventually
learn
.
They
would
have
to
bide
their
official
time
and
see
,
trusting
that
the
massive
doses
of
shell-psychology
would
suffice
her
,
too
,
as
the
necessary
bulwark
against
her
unusual
confinement
and
the
pressures
of
her
profession
.
A
ship
run
by
a
human
brain
could
not
run
rogue
or
insane
with
the
power
and
resources
Central
had
to
build
into
their
scout
ships
.
Brain
ships
were
,
of_course
,
long
past
the
experimental
stages
.
Most
babes
survived
the
techniques
of
pituitary
manipulation
that
kept
their
bodies
small
,
eliminating
the
necessity
of
transfers
from
smaller
to
larger
shells
.
And
very
,
very_few
were
lost
when
the
final
connection
was
made
to
the
control_panels
of
ship
or
industrial
combine
.
Shell
people
resembled
mature
dwarfs
in
size
whatever
their
natal
deformities
were
,
but
the
well-oriented
brain
would
not
have
changed
places
with
the_most
perfect
body
in
the
Universe
.
So
,
for
happy
years
,
Helva
scooted
around
in
her
shell
with
her
classmates
,
playing
such
games
as
Stall
,
Power-Seek
,
studying
her
lessons
in
trajectory
,
propulsion
techniques
,
computation
,
logistics
,
mental_hygiene
,
basic
alien
psychology
,
philology
,
space
history
,
law
,
traffic
,
codes
:
all
the
et
ceteras
that
eventually
became
compounded
into
a
reasoning
,
logical
,
informed
citizen
.
Not
so
obvious
to
her
,
but
of
more
importance
to
her
teachers
,
Helva
ingested
the
precepts
of
her
conditioning
as
easily
as
she
absorbed
her
nutrient
fluid
.
She
would
one_day
be
grateful
to
the
patient
drone
of
the
sub-conscious-level
instruction
.
Helva
's
civilization
was
not
without
busy
,
do-good
associations
,
exploring
possible
inhumanities
to
terrestrial
as_well
as
extraterrestrial
citizens
.
One
such
group
got
all
incensed
over
shelled
``
children
''
when
Helva
was
just
turning
fourteen
.
When
they
were
forced
to
,
Central
Worlds
shrugged
its
shoulders
,
arranged
a
tour
of
the
Laboratory_Schools
and
set
the
tour
off
to
a
big
start
by
showing
the
members
case_histories
,
complete
with
photographs
.
Very_few
committees
ever
looked
past
the
first
few
photos
.
Most_of
their
original
objections
about
``
shells
''
were
overridden
by
the
relief
that
these
hideous
(
to
them
)
bodies
were
mercifully
concealed
.
Helva
's
class
was
doing
Fine_Arts
,
a
selective
subject
in
her
crowded
program
.
She
had
activated
one
of
her
microscopic
tools
which
she
would
later
use
for
minute
repairs
to
various
parts
of
her
control_panel
.
Her
subject
was
large
-
a
copy
of
the
Last_Supper
-
and
her
canvas
,
small
-
the
head
of
a
tiny
screw
.
She
had
tuned
her
sight
to
the
proper
degree
.
As
she
worked
she
absentmindedly
crooned
,
producing
a
curious
sound
.
Shell
people
used
their
own
vocal_cords
and
diaphragms
but
sound
issued
through
microphones
rather_than
mouths
.
Helva
's
hum
then
had
a
curious
vibrancy
,
a
warm
,
dulcet
quality
even
in
its
aimless
chromatic
wanderings
.
``
Why
,
what
a
lovely
voice
you
have
''
,
said
one
of
the
female
visitors
.
Helva
``
looked
''
up
and
caught
a
fascinating
panorama
of
regular
,
dirty
craters
on
a
flaky
pink
surface
.
Her
hum
became
a
gurgle
of
surprise
.
She
instinctively
regulated
her
``
sight
''
until
the
skin
lost
its
cratered
look
and
the
pores
assumed
normal
proportions
.
``
Yes
,
we
have
quite_a_few
years
of
voice
training
,
madam
''
,
remarked
Helva
calmly
.
``
Vocal
peculiarities
often
become
excessively
irritating
during
prolonged
intra-stellar
distances
and
must
be
eliminated
.
I
enjoyed
my
lessons
''
.
Although
this
was
the
first
time
that
Helva
had
seen
unshelled
people
,
she
took
this
experience
calmly
.
Any
other
reaction
would
have
been
reported
instantly
.
``
I
meant
that
you
have
a
nice
singing_voice
,
dear
''
,
the
lady
amended
.
``
Thank_you
.
Would
you
like
to
see
my
work
''
?
Helva
asked
,
politely
.
She
instinctively
sheered
away
from
personal
discussions
but
she
filed
the
comment
away
for
further
meditation
.
``
Work
''
?
asked
the
lady
.
``
I
am
currently
reproducing
the
Last_Supper
on
the
head
of
a
screw
''
.
``
O
,
I
say
''
,
the
lady
twittered
.
Helva
turned
her
vision
back
to
magnification
and
surveyed
her
copy
critically
.
``
Of_course
,
some
of
my
color
values
do
not
match
the
old_Master
's
and
the
perspective
is
faulty
but
I
believe
it
to
be
a
fair_copy
''
.
The
lady
's
eyes
,
unmagnified
,
bugged_out
.
``
Oh
,
I
forget
''
,
and
Helva
's
voice
was
really
contrite
.
If
she
could
have
blushed
,
she
would
have
.
``
You
people
do
n't
have
adjustable
vision
''
.
The
monitor
of_this
discourse
grinned
with_pride
and
amusement
as
Helva
's
tone
indicated
pity
for
the
unfortunate
.
``
Here
,
this
will
help
''
,
suggested
Helva
,
substituting
a
magnifying
device
in
one
extension
and
holding
it
over
the
picture
.
In
a
kind_of
shock
,
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
committee
bent
to
observe
the
incredibly
copied
and
brilliantly
executed
Last_Supper
on
the
head
of
a
screw
.
``
Well
''
,
remarked
one
gentleman
who
had
been
forced
to
accompany
his
wife
,
``
the
good
Lord
can
eat
where
angels
fear
to
tread
''
.
``
Are
you
referring
,
sir
''
,
asked
Helva
politely
,
``
to
the
Dark_Age
discussions
of
the
number
of
angels
who
could
stand
on
the
head
of
a
pin
''
?
``
I
had
that
in
mind
''
.
``
If
you
substitute
'
atom
'
for
'
angel
'
,
the
problem
is
not
insoluble
,
given
the
metallic
content
of
the
pin
in_question
''
.
``
Which
you
are
programed
to
compute
''
?
``
Of_course
''
.
``
Did
they
remember
to
program
a
sense_of_humor
,
as_well
,
young_lady
''
?
``
We
are
directed
to
develop
a
sense
of
proportion
,
sir
,
which
contributes
the
same
effect
''
.
The
good
man
chortled
appreciatively
and
decided
the
trip
was
worth
his
time
.
If
the
investigation
committee
spent
months
digesting
the
thoughtful
food
served
them
at
the
Laboratory_School
,
they
left
Helva
with
a
morsel
as_well
.
``
Singing
''
as
applicable
to
herself
required
research
.
She
had
,
of_course
,
been
exposed
to
and
enjoyed
a
music
appreciation
course
which
had
included
the
better
known
classical
works
such_as
``
Tristan
und
Isolde
''
,
``
Candide
''
,
``
Oklahoma
''
,
``
Nozze
de
Figaro
''
,
the
atomic
age
singers
,
Eileen_Farrell
,
Elvis_Presley
and
Geraldine_Todd
,
as_well
as
the
curious
rhythmic
progressions
of
the
Venusians
,
Capellan
visual
chromatics
and
the
sonic
concerti
of
the
Altairians
.
But
``
singing
''
for
any
shell
person
posed
considerable
technical
difficulties
to
be
overcome
.
Shell
people
were
schooled
to
examine
every
aspect
of
a
problem
or
situation
before
making
a
prognosis
.
Balanced
properly
between
optimism
and
practicality
,
the
nondefeatist
attitude
of
the
shell
people
led
them
to
extricate
themselves
,
their
ships
and
personnel
,
from
bizarre
situations
.
Therefore
to
Helva
,
the
problem
that
she
could
n't
open
her
mouth
to
sing
,
among
other
restrictions
,
did
not
bother
her
.
She
would
work_out
a
method
,
by-passing
her
limitations
,
whereby
she
could
sing
.
She
approached
the
problem
by
investigating
the
methods
of
sound_reproduction
through
the
centuries
,
human
and
instrumental
.
Her
own
sound
production
equipment
was
essentially
more
instrumental
than
vocal
.
Breath
control
and
the
proper
enunciation
of
vowel_sounds
within
the
oral_cavity
appeared
to
require
the_most
development
and
practice
.
Shell
people
did
not
,
strictly_speaking
,
breathe
.
For
their
purposes
,
oxygen
and
other
gases
were
not
drawn
from
the
surrounding
atmosphere
through
the
medium
of
lungs
but
sustained
artificially
by
solution
in
their
shells
.
After
experimentation
,
Helva
discovered
that
she
could
manipulate
her
diaphragmic
unit
to
sustain
tone
.
By
relaxing
the
throat
muscles
and
expanding
the
oral_cavity
well
into
the
frontal_sinuses
,
she
could
direct
the
vowel_sounds
into
the_most
felicitous
position
for
proper
reproduction
through
her
throat
microphone
.
She
compared
the
results
with
tape_recordings
of
modern
singers
and
was
not
unpleased
although
her
own
tapes
had
a
peculiar
quality
about
them
,
not_at_all
unharmonious
,
merely
unique
.
Acquiring
a
repertoire
from
the
Laboratory
library
was
no
problem
to
one
trained
to
perfect
recall
.
She
found
herself
able
to
sing
any
role
and
any
song
which
struck
her
fancy
.
It
would
not
have
occurred
to
her
that
it
was
curious
for
a
female
to
sing
bass
,
baritone
,
tenor
,
alto
,
mezzo
,
soprano
and
coloratura
as
she
pleased
.
It
was
,
to
Helva
,
only
a
matter
of
the
correct
reproduction
and
diaphragmic
control
required
by
the
music
attempted
.
If
the
authorities
remarked
on
her
curious
avocation
,
they
did
so
among
themselves
.
Shell
people
were
encouraged
to
develop
a
hobby
so_long
as
they
maintained
proficiency
in
their
technical
work
.
On
the
anniversary
of
her
sixteenth
year
in
her
shell
,
Helva
was
unconditionally
graduated
and
installed
in
her
ship
,
the
XH-834
.
Her
permanent
titanium
shell
was
recessed
behind
an
even
more
indestructible
barrier
in
the
central
shaft
of
the
scout
ship
.
The
neural
,
audio
,
visual
and
sensory
connections
were
made
and
sealed
.
Her
extendibles
were
diverted
,
connected
or
augmented
and
the
final
,
delicate-beyond-description
brain
taps
were
completed
while
Helva
remained
anesthetically
unaware_of
the
proceedings
.
When
she
awoke
,
she
was
the
ship
.
Her
brain
and
intelligence
controlled
every
function
from
navigation
to
such
loading
as
a
scout
ship
of
her
class
needed
.
She
could
take_care
of
herself
and
her
ambulatory
half
,
in
any
situation
already
recorded
in
the
annals
of
Central
Worlds
and
any
situation
its
most
fertile
minds
could
imagine
.
Her
first
actual
flight
,
for
she
and
her
kind
had
made
mock
flights
on
dummy
panels
since
she
was
eight
,
showed
her
complete
mastery
of
the
techniques
of
her
profession
.
She
was
ready
for
her
great
adventures
and
the
arrival
of
her
mobile
partner
.
There
were
nine
qualified
scouts
sitting
around
collecting
base
pay
the
day
Helva
was
commissioned
.
There
were
several
missions
which
demanded
instant
attention
but
Helva
had
been
of
interest
to
several
department_heads
in
Central
for_some_time
and
each
man
was
determined
to
have
her
assigned
to
his
section
.
Consequently
no
one
had
remembered
to
introduce
Helva
to
the
prospective
partners
.
The
ship
always
chose
its
own
partner
.
Had
there
been
another
``
brain
''
ship
at
the
Base
at
the
moment
,
Helva
would
have
been
guided
to
make
the
first
move
.
As
it
was
,
while
Central
wrangled
among
itself
,
Robert_Tanner
sneaked_out
of
the
pilots
'
barracks
,
out
to
the
field
and
over
to
Helva
's
slim
metal
hull
.
``
Hello
,
anyone
at_home
''
?
Tanner
wisecracked
.
``
Of_course
''
,
replied
Helva
logically
,
activating
her
outside
scanners
.
``
Are
you
my
partner
''
?
she
asked
hopefully
,
as
she
recognized
the
Scout_Service
uniform
.
``
All
you
have
to
do
is
ask
''
,
he
retorted
hopefully
.
``
No
one
has
come
.
I
thought
perhaps
there
were
no
partners
available
and
I
've
had
no
directives
from
Central
''
.
Even
to
herself
Helva
sounded
a_little
self-pitying
but
the
truth
was
she
was
lonely
,
sitting
on
the
darkened
field
.
Always
she
had
had
the
company
of
other
shells
and
more
recently
,
technicians
by
the
score
.
The
sudden
solitude
had
lost
its
momentary
charm
and
become
oppressive
.
``
No
directives
from
Central
is
scarcely
a
cause
for
regret
,
but
there
happen
to
be
eight
other
guys
biting
their
fingernails
to
the
quick
just
waiting
for
an
invitation
to
board
you
,
you
beautiful
thing
''
.
