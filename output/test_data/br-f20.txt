As
part
of
the
same
arrangement
,
Torrio
had
,
in
the
spirit
of
peace
and
good_will
,
and
in
exchange
for
armed
support
in
the
April
election
campaign
,
bestowed
upon
O_'_Banion
a
third
share
in
the
Hawthorne_Smoke_Shop
proceeds
and
a
cut
in
the
Cicero
beer
trade
.
The
coalition
was
to
prove
inadvisable
.
O_'_Banion
was
a
complex
and
frightening
man
,
whose
bright_blue
eyes
stared
with
a
kind_of
frozen
candour
into
others
'
.
He
had
a
round
,
frank
Irish
face
,
creased
in
a
jovial
grin
that
stayed
bleakly
in_place
even
when
he
was
pumping
bullets
into
someone
's
body
.
He
carried
three
guns
-
one
in
the
right
trouser
pocket
,
one
under
his
left
armpit
,
one
in
the
left
outside
coat
pocket
-
and
was
equally
lethal
with
both
hands
.
He
killed
accurately
,
freely
,
and
dispassionately
.
The
police
credited
him
with
twenty-five
murders
but
he
was
never
brought
to
trial
for
one
of
them
.
Like
a
fair
number
of
bootleggers
he
disliked
alcohol
.
He
was
an
expert
florist
,
tenderly
dextrous
in
the
arrangement
of
bouquets
and
wreaths
.
He
had
no
apparent
comprehension
of
morality
;
he
divided
humanity
into
``
right
guys
''
and
``
wrong
guys
''
,
and
the
wrong
ones
he
was
always
willing
to
kill
and
trample
under
.
He
had
what
was
described
by
a
psychologist
as
a
``
sunny
brutality
''
.
He
walked
with
a
heavy
list
to
the
right
,
as
that
leg
was
four
inches
shorter
than
the
other
,
but
the
lurch
did
not
reduce
his
feline
quickness
with
his
guns
.
Landesco
thought
him
``
just
a
superior
sort
of
plugugly
''
but
he
was
,
in_fact
,
with
his
aggression
and
hostility
,
and
nerveless
indifference
to
risking
or
administering
pain
,
a
casebook
psychopath
.
He
was
also
at
this
time
,
although
not
so
interwoven
in
high
politics
and
the
rackets
as
Torrio
and
Capone
,
the
most
powerful
and
most
dangerous
mob
leader
in
the
Chicago
underworld
,
the
roughneck
king
.
O_'_Banion
was
born
in
poverty
,
the
son
of
an
immigrant
Irish
plasterer
,
in
the
North_Side
's
Little_Hell
,
close
by
the
Sicilian
quarter
and
Death_Corner
.
He
had
been
a
choir_boy
at
the
Holy_Name_Cathedral
and
also
served
as
an
acolyte
to
Father_O_'_Brien
.
The
influence
of
Mass
was
less
pervasive
than
that
of
the
congested
,
slum
tenements
among
the
bawdy_houses
,
honkytonks
,
and
sawdust_saloons
of
his
birthplace
;
he
ran
wild
with
the
child
gangs
of
the
neighbourhood
,
and
went_through
the
normal
pressure-cooker
course
of
thieving
,
police
dodging
,
and
housebreaking
.
At
the
age
of
ten
,
when
he
was
working
as
a
newsboy
in
the
Loop
,
he
was
knocked_down
by
a
streetcar
which
resulted
in
his
permanently
shortened
leg
.
Because
of
this
he
was
known_as
Gimpy
(
but
,
as
with
Capone
and
his
nickname
of
Scarface
,
never
in
his
presence
)
.
In
his
teens
O_'_Banion
was
enrolled
in
the
vicious
Market_Street
gang
and
he
became
a
singing
waiter
in
McGovern's_Cafe
,
a
notoriously
low
and
rowdy
dive
in
North_Clark_Street
,
where
befuddled
customers
were
methodically
looted
of
their
money
by
the
singing
waiters
before
being
thrown_out
.
He
then
got
a
job
with
the
Chicago_Herald-Examiner
as
a
circulation_slugger
,
a
rough
fighter
employed
to
see
that
his
paper
's
news
pitches
were
not
trespassed
upon
by
rival
vendors
.
He
was
also
at_the_same_time
gaining
practical
experience
as
a
safe_breaker
and
highwayman
,
and
learning
how
to
shoot
to
kill
from
a
Neanderthal
convicted
murderer
named
Gene_Geary
,
later
committed
to
Chester_Asylum
as
a
homicidal
maniac
,
but
whose
eyes
misted
with
tears
when
the
young
Dion
sang
a
ballad
about
an
Irish
mother
in
his
clear
and
syrupy
tenor
.
O_'_Banion
's
first
conflict
with
the
police
came
in
1909
,
at
seventeen
,
when
he
was
committed
to
Bridewell_Prison
for
three
months
for
burglary
;
two
years
later
he
served
another
three
months
for
assault
.
Those
were
his
only
interludes
behind
bars
,
although
he
collected
four
more
charges
on
his
police
record
in
1921
and
1922
,
three
for
burglary
and
one
for
robbery
.
But
by
now
O_'_Banion
's
political
pull
was
beginning
to
be
effective
.
On
the
occasion
of
his
1922
indictment
the
$
10000
bond
was
furnished
by
an
alderman
,
and
the
charge
was
nolle_prossed
.
On
one
of
his
1921
ventures
he
was
actually
come_upon
by
a
Detective_Sergeant_John_J._Ryan
down
on
his
knees
with
a
tool
embedded
in
a
labour
office
safe
in
the
Postal_Telegraph_Building
;
the
jury
wanted
better
evidence
than
that
and
he
was
acquitted
,
at
a
cost
of
$
30000
in
bribes
,
it
was
estimated
.
As
promptly
as
Torrio
,
O_'_Banion
jumped
into
bootlegging
.
He
conducted
it
with
less
diplomacy
and
more
spontaneous
violence
than
the
Sicilians
,
but
he
had
his
huge
North_Side
portion
to
exploit
and
he
made
a
great_deal
of
money
.
Unlike
the
Sicilians
,
he
additionally
conducted
holdups
,
robberies
,
and
safe
cracking
expeditions
,
and
refused
to
touch
prostitution
.
He
was
also
personally
active
in
ward
politics
,
and
by
1924
O_'_Banion
had
acquired
sufficient
political
might
to
be
able
to
state
:
``
I
always
deliver
my
borough
as
per
requirements
''
.
But
whose
requirements
?
Until
1924
O_'_Banion
pistoleers
and
knuckle-duster
bullyboys
had
kept
his
North_Side
domain
solidly
Democratic
.
There
was
a
question
and
answer
gag
that
went_around
at
that
time
:
Q.
``
Who
'll
carry
the
Forty-second
and
Forty-third
wards
''
?
A.
``
O_'_Banion
,
in
his
pistol
pocket
''
.
But
as
November
1924
drew
close
the
Democratic
hierarchy
was
sorely
troubled
by
grapevine
reports
that
O_'_Banion
was
being
wooed
by
the
opposition
,
and
was
meeting
and
conferring
with
important
Republicans
.
To
forestall
any
change
of
allegiance
,
the
Democrats
hastily
organised
a
testimonial
banquet
for
O_'_Banion
,
as
public
reward
for
his
past
services
and
as
a
reminder
of
where
his
loyalties
lay
.
The
reception
was
held
in
a
private
dining_room
of
the
Webster_Hotel
on
Lincoln_Park_West
.
It
was
an
interesting
fraternisation
of
ex
convicts
,
union
racketeers
,
ward_heelers
,
sold-out
officials
,
and
gunmen
.
The
guest
list
is
in
itself
a
little
parable
of
the
state
of
American
civic
life
at
this
time
.
It
included
the
top
O_'_Banion
men
and
Chief_of_Detectives_Michael_Hughes
.
When
Mayor_Dever
heard
of
the
banquet
he
summoned
Hughes
for
an
explanation
of
why
he
had
been
dishonouring
the
police_department
by
consorting
with
these
felons
and
fixers
.
Hughes
said
that
he
had
understood
the
party
was
to
be
in
honour
of
Jerry_O_'_Connor
,
the
proprieter
of
a
Loop
gambling_house
.
``
But
when
I
arrived
and
recognised
a
number
of
notorious
characters
I
had
thrown
into
the
detective
bureau
basement
half_a_dozen
times
,
I
knew
I
had
been
framed
,
and
withdrew
almost
at_once
''
.
In_fact
,
O_'_Connor
was
honoured
during
the
ceremony
with
the
presentation
of
a
$
2500
diamond
stickpin
.
There
was
a
brief
interruption
while
one
of
O_'_Banion
's
men
jerked
out
both
his
guns
and
threatened
to
shoot
a
waiter
who
was
pestering
him
for
a
tip
.
Then
O_'_Banion
was
presented
with
a
platinum
watch
set
with
rubies
and
diamonds
.
This
dinner
was
the
start
of
a
new
blatancy
in
the
relationship
between
the
gangs
and
the
politicians
,
which
,
prior
to
1924
,
says
Pasley
,
``
had
been
maintained
with
more_or_less
stealth
''
,
but
which
henceforth
was
marked
by
these
ostentatious
gatherings
,
denounced
by
a
clergyman
as
``
Belshazzar
feasts
''
,
at
which
``
politicians
fraternized
cheek_by_jowl
with
gangsters
,
openly
,
in
the
big
downtown
hotels
''
.
Pasley
continued
:
``
They
became
an
institution
of
the
Chicago
scene
and
marked
the
way
to
the
moral
and
financial
collapse
of
the
municipal
and
county
governments
in
1928_-_29
''
.
However
,
this
inaugural
feast
did
its
sponsors
no
good
whatever
.
O_'_Banion
accepted
his
platinum
watch
and
the
tributes
to
his
loyalty
,
and
proceeded
with
the
bigger
and
better
Republican
deal
.
On
Election_Day
-
November
4
-
he
energetically
marshalled
his
force
of
bludgeon
men
,
bribers
,
and
experts
in
forging
repeat
votes
.
The
result
was
a
landslide
for
the
Republican
candidates
.
This
further
demonstration
of
O_'_Banion
's
ballooning
power
did
not
please
Torrio
and
Capone
.
In
the
past
year
there
had
been
too
many
examples
of
his
euphoric
self-confidence
and
self_aggrandisement
for
their
liking
.
He
behaved
publicly
with
a
cocky
,
swaggering
truculence
that
offended
their
vulpine
Latin
minds
,
and
behaved
towards
them
personally
with
an
unimpressed
insolence
that
enraged
them
beneath
their
blandness
.
They
were
disturbed
by
his
idiotic
bravado
-
as
,
when
his
bodyguard
,
Yankee_Schwartz
,
complained
that
he
had
been
snubbed
by
Dave_Miller
,
a
prize-fight
referee
,
chieftain
of
a
Jewish
gang
and
one
of
four
brothers
of
tough
reputation
,
who
were
Hirschey
,
a
gambler
politician
in
loose
beer
running
league
with
Torrio
and
O_'_Banion
,
Frank
,
a
policeman
,
and
Max
,
the
youngest
.
To
settle
this
slight
,
O_'_Banion
went
down
to
the
La_Salle_Theatre
in
the
Loop
,
where
,
he
had
learned
,
Dave_Miller
was
attending
the
opening
of
a
musical_comedy
.
At
the
end
of
the
performance
,
Dave
and
Max
came_out
into
the
brilliantly
lit
foyer
among
a
surge
of
gowned
and
tuxedoed
first_nighters
.
O_'_Banion
drew
his
guns
and
fired
at
Dave
,
severely
wounding
him
in
the
stomach
.
A
second
bullet
ricocheted
off
Max
's
belt_buckle
,
leaving
him
unhurt
but
in
some
distress
.
O_'_Banion
tucked
away
his
gun
and
walked
out
of
the
theatre
;
he
was
neither
prosecuted
nor
even
arrested
.
That
sort
of
braggadocio
,
for
that
sort
of
reason
,
in
the
view
of
Torrio
and
Capone
,
was
a
nonsense
.
A
further
example
of
the
incompatible
difference
in
personalities
was
when
two
policemen
held_up
a
Torrio
beer
convoy
on
a
West_Side
street
and
demanded
$
300
to
let
it
through
.
One
of
the
beer
runners
telephoned
O_'_Banion
-
on
a
line
tapped
by
the
detective
bureau
-
and
reported
the
situation
.
O_'_Banion
's
reaction
was
:
``
Three_hundred
dollars
!
To
them
bums
?
Why
,
I
can
get
them
knocked_off
for
half
that_much
''
.
Upon
which
the
detective
bureau
despatched
rifle
squads
to
prevent
trouble
if
O_'_Banion
should
send
his
gunmen
out
to
deal
with
the
hijacking
policemen
.
But
in_the_meantime
the
beer
runner
,
unhappy
with
this
solution
,
telephoned
Torrio
and
returned
to
O_'_Banion
with
the
message
:
``
Say
,
Dionie
,
I
just
been
talking
to
Johnny
,
and
he
said
to
let
them
cops
have
the
three_hundred
.
He
says
he
do
n't
want
no
trouble
''
.
But
Torrio
and
Capone
had
graver
cause
to
hate
and
distrust
the
Irishman
.
For
three
years
,
since
the
liquor
territorial
conference
,
Torrio
had
,
with
his
elastic
patience
,
and
because
he
knew
that
retaliation
could
cause
only
violent
warfare
and
disaster
to
business
,
tolerated
O_'_Banion
's
impudent
double-crossing
.
They
had
suffered
,
in
sulky
silence
,
the
sight
of
his
sharp
practice
in
Cicero
.
When
,
as
a
diplomatic
gesture
of
amity
and
in
payment
for
the
loan
of
gunmen
in
the
April
election
,
Torrio
had
given
O_'_Banion
a
slice
of
Cicero
,
the
profits
from
that
district
had
been
$
20000
a
month
.
In
six
months
O_'_Banion
had
boosted
the
profits
to
$
100000
a
month
-
mainly
by
bringing
pressure
to
bear
on
fifty
Chicago
speak-easy
proprietors
to
shift
out
to
the
suburb
.
These
booze
customers
had
until
then
been
buying
their
supplies
from
the
Sheldon
,
Saltis-McErlane
,
and
Druggan-Lake
gangs
,
and
now
they
were
competing
for
trade
with
the
Torrio-Capone
saloons
;
once_again
O_'_Banion
's
brash
recklessness
had
caused
a
proliferation
of
ill_will
.
The
revenue
from
O_'_Banion
's
Cicero
territory
went_up
still
higher
,
until
the
yield
was
more_than
the
Torrio-Capone
takings
from
the
far
bigger
trade
area
of
Chicago
's
South
and
West_Sides
.
But
he
still
showed
no
intention
of
sharing
with
the
syndicate
.
At_last
,
even
the
controlled
Torrio
was
unable
to
hold
still
,
and
he
tentatively
suggested
that
O_'_Banion
should
take
a
percentage
in
the
Stickney
brothels
in_return
for
one
from
his
Cicero
beer
concession
.
O_'_Banion
's
reply
was
a
raucous
laugh
and
a
flat
refusal
.
Still
more
jealous
bitterness
was
engendered
by
the
O_'_Banion
gang
's
seizure
from
a
West_Side
marshalling_yard
of
a
freight-car
load
of
Canadian
whisky
worth
$
100000
and
by
one
of
the
biggest
coups
of
the
Prohibition_era
-
the
Sibley
warehouse
robbery
,
which
became
famous
for
the
cool
brazenness
of
the
operation
.
Here
was
stored
$
1000000
worth
of
bonded
whisky
.
These
1750
cases
were
carted_off
in
a
one
night
operation
by
the
O_'_Banion
men
,
who
left
in
their
stead
the
same
number
of
barrels
filled
with
water
.
