Once_again
,
as
in
the
days
of
the
Founding
Fathers
,
America
faces
a
stern
test
.
That
test
,
as
President_Kennedy
forthrightly
depicted
it
in
his
State
of
the
Union
message
,
will
determine
``
whether
a
nation
organized
and
governed
such_as
ours
can
endure
''
.
It
is
well
then
that
in_this
hour
both
of
``
national
peril
''
and
of
``
national
opportunity
''
we
can
take_counsel
with
the
men
who
made
the
nation
.
Incapable_of
self-delusion
,
the
Founding
Fathers
found
the
crisis
of
their
time
to
be
equally
grave
,
and
yet
they
had
confidence
that
America
would
surmount
it
and
that
a
republic
of
free
peoples
would
prosper
and
serve
as
an
example
to
a
world
aching
for
liberty
.
Seven
Founders
-
George_Washington
,
Benjamin_Franklin
,
John_Adams
,
Thomas_Jefferson
,
Alexander_Hamilton
,
James_Madison
and
John_Jay
-
determined
the
destinies
of
the
new
nation
.
In
certain
respects
,
their
task
was
incomparably
greater
than
ours
today
,
for
there
was
nobody
before
them
to
show
them
the
way
.
As
Madison
commented
to
Jefferson
in
1789
,
``
We
are
in
a
wilderness
without
a
single
footstep
to
guide
us
.
Our
successors
will
have
an
easier
task
''
.
They
thought_of
themselves
,
to
use
Jefferson
's
words
,
as
``
the
Argonauts
''
who
had
lived
in
``
the
Heroic_Age
''
.
Accordingly
,
they
took
special
pains
to
preserve
their
papers
as
essential
sources
for
posterity
.
Their
writings
assume
more_than
dramatic
or
patriotic
interest
because
of
their
conviction
that
the
struggle
in_which
they
were
involved
was
neither
selfish
nor
parochial
but
,
rather
,
as
Washington
in
his
last
wartime
circular
reminded
his
fellow
countrymen
,
that
``
with
our
fate
will
the
destiny
of
unborn
millions
be
involved
''
.
Strong
men
with
strong
opinions
,
frank
to_the_point
of
being
refreshingly
indiscreet
,
the
Founding
Seven
were
essentially
congenial
minds
,
and
their
agreements
with
each
other
were
more
consequential
than
their
differences
.
Even_though
in
most
cases
the
completion
of
the
definitive
editions
of
their
writings
is
still
years
off
,
enough
documentation
has
already
been
assembled
to
warrant
drawing
a
new
composite
profile
of
the
leadership
which
performed
the
heroic
dual
feats
of
winning
American
independence
and
founding
a
new
nation
.
Before
merging
them
into
a
common
profile
it
is
well
to
remember
that
their
separate
careers
were
extraordinary
.
Certainly
no
other
seven
American
statesmen
from
any
later
period
achieved
so_much
in
so
concentrated
a
span
of
years
.
Eldest
of
the
seven
,
Benjamin_Franklin
,
a
New_Englander
transplanted
to
Philadelphia
,
wrote
the_most
dazzling
success
story
in
our
history
.
The
young
printer
's
apprentice
achieved
greatness
in
a
half-dozen
different
fields
,
as
editor
and
publisher
,
scientist
,
inventor
,
philanthropist
and
statesman
.
Author
of
the
Albany_Plan
of
Union
,
which
,
had
it
been
adopted
,
might
have
avoided
the
Revolution
,
he
fought
the
colonists
'
front-line
battles
in
London
,
negotiated
the
treaty
of
alliance
with
France
and
the
peace
that
ended
the
war
,
headed
the
state_government
of
Pennsylvania
,
and
exercised
an
important
moderating
influence
at
the
Federal_Convention
.
On
a
military_mission
for
his
native
Virginia
the
youthful
George_Washington
touched_off
the_French
and
Indian_War
,
then
guarded
his
colony
's
frontier
as
head
of
its
militia
.
Commanding
the
Continental_Army
for
six
long
years
of
the
Revolution
,
he
was
the
indispensable
factor
in
the
ultimate
victory
.
Retiring
to
his
beloved
Mount_Vernon
,
he
returned
to
preside
over
the
Federal_Convention
,
and
was
the
only
man
in
history
to
be
unanimously
elected
President
.
During
his
two
terms
the
Constitution
was
tested
and
found
workable
,
strong
national
policies
were
inaugurated
,
and
the
traditions
and
powers
of
the
Presidential
office
firmly
fixed
.
John_Adams
fashioned
much
of
pre-Revolutionary
radical
ideology
,
wrote
the
constitution
of
his
home
state
of
Massachusetts
,
negotiated
,
with
Franklin
and
Jay
,
the
peace
with
Britain
and
served
as
our
first
Vice_President
and
our
second
President
.
His
political
opponent
and
lifetime
friend
,
Thomas_Jefferson
,
achieved
immortality
through
his
authorship
of
the
Declaration_of_Independence
,
but
equally
notable
were
the
legal
and
constitutional
reforms
he
instituted
in
his
native
Virginia
,
his
role
as
father
of
our
territorial
system
,
and
his
acquisition
of
the
Louisiana_Territory
during
his
first
term
as
President
.
During
the
greater
part
of
Jefferson
's
career
he
enjoyed
the
close
collaboration
of
a
fellow
Virginian
,
James_Madison
,
eight
years
his
junior
.
The
active
sponsor
of
Jefferson
's
measure
for
religious
liberty
in
Virginia
,
Madison
played
the_most
influential
single
role
in
the
drafting
of
the
Constitution
and
in
securing
its
ratification
in
Virginia
,
founded
the
first
political_party
in
American
history
,
and
,
as
Jefferson
's
Secretary_of_State
and
his
successor
in
the
Presidency
,
guided
the
nation
through
the
troubled
years
of
our
second
war
with
Britain
.
If
Franklin
was
an
authentic
genius
,
then
Alexander_Hamilton
,
with
his
exceptional
precocity
,
consuming
energy
,
and
high
ambition
,
was
a
political
prodigy
.
His
revolutionary
pamphlets
,
published
when
he
was
only
19
,
quickly
brought
him
to
the
attention
of
the
patriot
leaders
.
Principal
author
of
``
The
Federalist
''
,
he
swung
New_York
over
from
opposition
to
the
Constitution
to
ratification
almost
single-handedly
.
His
collaboration
with
Washington
,
begun
when
he
was
the
general
's
aide
during
the
Revolution
,
was
resumed
when
he
entered
the
first
Cabinet
as
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
.
His
bold
fiscal
program
and
his
broad
interpretation
of
the
Constitution
stand
as
durable
contributions
.
Less
dazzling
than
Hamilton
,
less
eloquent
than
Jefferson
,
John_Jay
commands
an
equally
high
rank
among
the
Founding
Fathers
.
He
served
as
president
of
the
Continental_Congress
.
He
played
the
leading
role
in
negotiating
the
treaty
with
Great_Britain
that
ended
the
Revolution
,
and
directed
America
's
foreign
affairs
throughout
the
Confederation
period
.
As
first
Chief_Justice
,
his
strong
nationalist
opinions
anticipated
John_Marshall
.
He
ended
his
public
career
as
a
two-term
governor
of
New_York
.
These
Seven
Founders
constituted
an
intellectual
and
social
elite
,
the_most
respectable
and
disinterested
leadership
any
revolution
ever
confessed
.
Their
social_status
was
achieved
in
some
cases
by
birth
,
as
with
Washington
,
Jefferson
and
Jay
;
in
others
by
business
and
professional
acumen
,
as
with
Franklin
and
Adams
,
or
,
in
Hamilton
's
case
,
by
an
influential
marriage
.
Unlike
so
many_of
the
power-starved
intellectuals
in
underdeveloped
nations
of
our
own
day
,
they
commanded
both
prestige
and
influence
before
the
Revolution
started
.
As
different
physically
as
the
tall
,
angular
Jefferson
was
from
the
chubby
,
rotund
Adams
,
the
seven
were
striking
individualists
.
Ardent
,
opinionated
,
even
obstinate
,
they
were
amazingly
articulate
,
wrote
their
own
copy
,
and
were
masters
of
phrasemaking
.
Capable_of
enduring
friendships
,
they
were
also
stout
controversialists
,
who
could
write
with
a
drop
of
vitriol
on
their
pens
.
John_Adams
dismissed
John_Dickinson
,
who
voted
against
the
Declaration_of_Independence
,
as
``
a
certain
great
fortune
and
piddling
genius
''
.
Washington
castigated
his
critic
,
General_Conway
,
as
being
capable_of
``
all
the
meanness
of
intrigue
to
gratify
the
absurd
resentment
of
disappointed
vanity
''
.
And
Hamilton
,
who
felt
it
``
a
religious
duty
''
to
oppose
Aaron_Burr
's
political
ambitions
,
would
have
been
a
better
actuarial
risk
had
he
shown
more
literary
restraint
.
The
Seven
Founders
were
completely
dedicated_to
the
public_service
.
Madison
once
remarked
:
``
My
life
has
been
so_much
a
public
one
''
,
a
comment
which
fits
the
careers
of
the
other
six
.
Franklin
retired
from
editing
and
publishing
at
the
age
of
42
,
and
for
the
next
forty-two
years
devoted
himself
to
public
,
scientific
,
and
philanthropic
interests
.
Washington
never
had
a
chance
to
work
for
an
extended
stretch
at
the
occupation
he
loved
best
,
plantation
management
.
He
served
as
Commander_in_Chief
during
the
Revolution
without
compensation
.
John_Adams
took_to_heart
the
advice
given
him
by
his
legal
mentor
,
Jeremiah_Gridley
,
to
``
pursue
the
study
of
the
law
,
rather_than
the
gain
of_it
''
.
In
taking
account
of
seventeen
years
of
law_practice
,
Adams
concluded
that
``
no
lawyer
in
America
ever
did
so_much
business
as
I
did
''
and
``
for
so
little
profit
''
.
When
the
Revolution
broke_out
,
he
,
along
with
Jefferson
and
Jay
,
abandoned
his
career
at
the
bar
,
with
considerable
financial
sacrifice
.
Hamilton
,
poorest
of
the
seven
,
gave_up
a
brilliant
law_practice
to
enter
Washington
's
Cabinet
.
While
he
was
handling
the
multi-million-dollar
funding
operations
of
the
Government
he
had_to
resort
to
borrowing
small
sums
from
friends
.
``
If
you
can
conveniently
let
me
have
twenty
dollars
''
,
he
wrote
one
friend
in
1791
when
he
was
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
.
To
support
his
large
family
Hamilton
went_back
to
the
law
after
each
spell
of
public_service
.
Talleyrand
passed
his
New_York
law
office
one
night
on_the_way
to
a
party
.
Hamilton
was
bent
over
his
desk
,
drafting
a
legal
paper
by
the
light
of
a
candle
.
The
Frenchman
was
astonished
.
``
I
have
just
come
from
viewing
a
man
who
had
made
the
fortune
of
his
country
,
but
now
is
working
all
night
in_order_to
support
his
family
''
,
he
reflected
.
All
seven
combined
ardent
devotion
to
the
cause
of
revolution
with
a
profound
respect
for
legality
.
John_Adams
asserted
in
the
Continental_Congress
'
Declaration
of
Rights
that
the
demands
of
the_colonies
were
in_accordance_with
their
charters
,
the_British
Constitution
and
the
common_law
,
and
Jefferson
appealed
in
the
Declaration_of_Independence
``
to
the
tribunal
of
the
world
''
for
support
of
a
revolution
justified
by
``
the
laws_of_nature
and
of
nature
's
God
''
.
They
fought
hard
,
but
they
were
forgiving
to
former
foes
,
and
sought
to
prevent
vindictive
legislatures
from
confiscating
Tory
property
in
violation
of
the
Treaty
of
1783
.
This
sense
of
moderation
and
fairness
is
superbly
exemplified
in
an
exchange
of
letters
between
John_Jay
and
a
Tory
refugee
,
Peter_Van_Schaack
.
Jay
had
participated
in
the
decision
that
exiled
his
old
friend
Van_Schaack
.
Yet
when
,
at_war
's
end
,
the
ex-Tory
made
the
first
move
to
resume
correspondence
,
Jay
wrote
him
from
Paris
,
where
he
was
negotiating
the
peace
settlement
:
``
As
an
independent
American
I
considered
all
who
were
not
for
us
,
and
you
amongst
the
rest
,
as
against
us
,
yet
be
assured
that
John_Jay
never
ceased
to
be
the
friend
of
Peter_Van_Schaack
''
.
The
latter
in_turn
assured
him
that
``
were
I
arraigned
at
the
bar
,
and
you
my
judge
,
I
should
expect
to
stand
or
fall
only
by
the
merits
of
my
cause
''
.
All
seven
recognized
that
independence
was
but
the
first_step
toward
building
a
nation
.
``
We
have
now
a
national
character
to
establish
''
,
Washington
wrote
in
1783
.
``
Think
continentally
''
,
Hamilton
counseled
the
young
nation
.
This
new
force
,
love_of_country
,
super-imposed
upon
-
if_not
displacing
-
affectionate
ties
to
one
's
own
state
,
was
epitomized
by
Washington
.
His
first
inaugural_address
speaks
of
``
my
country
whose
voice
I
can
never
hear
but
with
veneration
and
love
''
.
All
sought
the
fruition
of_that
nationalism
in
a
Federal_Government
with
substantial
powers
.
Save
Jefferson
,
all
participated
in
the
framing
or
ratification
of
the
Federal_Constitution
.
They
supported
it
,
not
as
a
perfect
instrument
,
but
as
the
best
obtainable
.
Historians
have
traditionally
regarded
the
great
debates
of
the
Seventeen
Nineties
as
polarizing
the
issues
of
centralized
vs.
limited
government
,
with
Hamilton
and
the
nationalists
supporting
the
former
and
Jefferson
and
Madison
upholding
the
latter
position
.
The
state
's
rights
position
was
formulated
by
Jefferson
and
Madison
in
the
Kentucky
and
Virginia
Resolves
,
but
in
their
later
careers
as
heads_of_state
the
two
proved
themselves
better
Hamiltonians
than
Jeffersonians
.
In
purchasing
Louisiana
,
Jefferson
had_to
adopt
Hamilton
's
broad
construction
of
the
Constitution
,
and
so
did
Madison
in
advocating
the
rechartering
of
Hamilton
's
bank
,
which
he
had
so
strenuously
opposed
at
its
inception
,
and
in
adopting
a
Hamiltonian
protective_tariff
.
Indeed
,
the
old
Jeffersonians
were
far
more
atune
to
the
Hamilton-oriented
Whigs
than
they
were
to
the
Jacksonian
Democrats
.
When
,
in
1832
,
the
South_Carolina
nullifiers
adopted
the
principle
of
state
interposition
which
Madison
had
advanced
in
his
old
Virginia_Resolve
,
they
elicited
no
encouragement
from_that
senior
statesman
.
In
his
political
testament
,
``
Advice
to
My
Country
''
,
penned
just
before
his
death
,
Madison
expressed
the
wish
``
that
the
Union
of
the
States
be
cherished
and
perpetuated
.
Let
the
open
enemy
to_it
be
regarded_as
a
Pandora
with
her
box
opened
;
and
the
disguised
one
,
as
the
serpent
creeping
with
his
deadly
wiles
into
Paradise
''
.
