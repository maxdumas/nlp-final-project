If
THE
Dominican_Republic
achieves
free
,
democratic
government
,
it
will
be_due
in
large
part
to
the
U._S.
show
of
force
that
enabled
President_Balaguer
to
prevent
a
threatened
restoration
of
Trujillo
dictatorship
.
Outwardly
,
Ciudad_Trujillo
is
calm
.
None
of
the
Trujillo
family
remains
.
Mr._Balaguer
is
in
control
,
and
opposition
leaders
have
no
further
excuse
to
suspect
his
offer
of
a
coalition
government
preliminary
to
free
elections
in
the
spring
.
Had
U._S.
warships
not
appeared
off
the
Dominican
coast
,
there
is
every
possibility
that
the
country
would
now
be
wracked
by
civil_war
.
Ultimately
either
the
Trujillos
would
have
been
returned
to
power
or
the
conflict
would
have
produced
conditions
favorable
to
a
takeover
by
Dominican
elements
responsive
to
Castro
in
Cuba
.
Within
the
Organization_of_American_States
,
there
may
be
some
criticism
of_this
unilateral
American
intervention
which
was
not
without
risk
obviously
.
But
there
was
no
complaint
from
the
Dominican
crowds
which
lined
Ciudad_Trujillo
's
waterfront
shouting
,
``
Vive
Yankees
''
!
More
,
the
U._S.
action
was
hailed
by
a
principal
opposition
leader
,
Dr._Juan_Bosch
,
as
having
saved
``
many
lives
and
many
troubles
in
the
near
future
''
.
Mr._Balaguer
's
troubles
are
by_no_means
over
.
He
will
need
the
help
of
all
OAS
members
to
eradicate
,
finally
,
the
forces
of
authoritarianism
,
pro-Trujillo
and
pro-Castro
alike
.
In
cooperating
toward
that
objective
,
OAS
might
move
with
the
speed
and
effectiveness
demonstrated
by
the
United_States
.
Those
watching
the
growing
rivalry
between
craft_unions
and
industrial_unions
may
recognize
all
the
pressures
that
led
to
the
big
labor
split
in
1935
.
Now
,
as
then
,
it
is
a
matter
of
jobs
.
Craft_unions
seek
work
that
industrial_unions
claim
,
such_as
factory
maintenance
.
The
issue
was
sufficiently
potent
in
1935
to
spark
secession
from
the
American_Federation
of
Labor
of
its
industrial_union
members
.
That
breach
was
healed
20
years
later
by
merger
of
the
American_Federation
of
Labor
and
the
Congress
of
Industrial_Organizations
.
Or
that
's
what
it
looked_like
at_the_time
.
But
automation
and
the
increasing
complexity
of
factories
has
renewed
the
competition
for
jobs
.
Walter_Reuther
,
leader
of
the
industrial_union
faction
of
the
AFL
-
CIO
,
says
another
two
years
of_this
squabbling
will
be
disastrous
for
all
American
labor
.
Whether
it
could
be
as
disastrous
for
American
labor
as
,
say
,
Jimmy_Hoffa
of
the
Teamsters
,
is
a
matter
of
conjecture
.
But
the
jurisdictional
disputes
that
result
from
the
craft-industrial
rivalry
do
not
win
friends
for
labor
.
Engaged
as_it_is
in
a
battle
for
world
trade
as
a
condition
of
national
survival
,
this
country
can
have
little
patience
with
labor
's
family
feuds
.
The
concept
of
labor
as
a
special
class
is
outmoded
,
and
in
the
task
confronting
America
as
bastion
of
the
free_world
,
labor
must
learn
to
put
the
national
interest
first
if
it
is
itself
to
survive
.
The
Army
,
Navy
and
Air_Force
,
among
others
,
may
question
Secretary_Freeman
's
claim
that
the
high
estate
of
United_States
agriculture
is
the
``
strongest
deterrent
''
to
the
spread
of
communism
.
But
the
secretary
insists
that
the
success
of
the
American
farmer
is
the
``
greatest
single
source
of
strength
''
in
the
struggle
to
insure
freedom
around
the
world
.
Mr._Freeman
said
that
in
many_of
the
countries
he
visited
on
a
recent
world
trade
trip
people
were
more
awed
by
America
's
capacity
to
produce
food
surpluses
than
by
our
industrial
production
-
or
even
by
the
Soviet
's
successes
in
space
.
This
should
n't
surprise
the
secretary
;
American
taxpayers
have
been
impressed
by
the
surpluses
for
a
long
,
long_time
.
In_fact
,
over
the
years
,
the
American
farmer
's
capacity
to
over-produce
has
cost
the
taxpayers
a
large
dollar
.
And
thus_far
,
Mr._Freeman
has
offered
very
little
relief
.
The
1961
feed_grain
program
,
which
the
secretary
sponsored
,
has
been
declared
a_billion
dollar
fiasco
.
In
exchange
for
higher
price_supports
,
growers
pledged
reduction
in
planted
acreage
.
But
the
farmers
outsmarted
Washington
by
shortening
the
distance
between
the
rows
and
pouring
on
the
fertilizer
.
The
result
:
$
1.1
billion
added
to
the
deficit
in
the
federal
budget
.
Perhaps
,
as
Mr._Freeman
says
,
American
agriculture
may
stop
the
Communists
,
but
it
is
also
swindling
the
American
taxpayer
.
A
Senate
subcommittee
headed
by
Sen._Jackson
of
Washington
has
been
going_over
the
State_Department
and
has
reached
some
predictable
conclusions
.
The
department
needs
a
clearer
``
sense_of_direction
''
at
the
top
and
it
needs
fewer
,
but
better
,
people
,
Sen._Jackson
says
.
The
subcommittee
is
not
alone
in
questioning
the
effectiveness
of
the
department
.
President_Kennedy
has
indicated
his
dissatisfaction
with
its
performance
.
But
those
who
would
revitalize
so
complex
an
organization
must
,
first_of_all
,
overcome
the
resistance
of
layers
of
officials
wedded
to
traditional
procedures
,
suspicious
of
innovation
and
fearful
of
mistakes
.
Nor
does
Sen._Jackson
discuss
the
delicate
situation
created
by
the
presence
in
the
White_House
of
a
corps
of
presidential
assistants
engaged
in
the
study
of
foreign_policy
.
This
tends
to
create
friction
and
confusion
and
has
not
made
it
easier
for
Secretary_Rusk
to
restore
vigor
and
initiative
among
his
subordinates
.
But
competent
observers
believe
he
is
making
progress
,
particularly
toward
what
Sen._Jackson
lists
as
the
primary
need
-
``
a
clearer
understanding
of
where
our
vital
national
interests
lie
and
what
we
must
do
to
promote
them
''
.
The
Jackson
report
will
provide
some
of
the
political
support
Mr._Rusk
will
need
if
he
is
to
get_rid_of
department
personnel
engaged
,
as
Sen._Jackson
puts
it
,
``
in
work
that
does
not
really
need
doing
''
.
Mr._Rusk
should
also
draw
comfort
from
Sen._Jackson
's
recommendation
that
congressional
methods
of
dealing
with
national
security
problems
be
improved
.
Self-criticism
is
a
rare
but
needed
commodity
in
Congress
.
Forecasting
economic
activity
is
a
hazardous
undertaking
even
for
the
specialist
.
But
now
apparently
the
job
of
Secretary
of
Labor
requires
that
he
be
willing
to
risk
his
reputation
as
a
prognosticator
of
unemployment
trends
.
James_P._Mitchell
,
when
he
was
the
head
of
the
department
,
promised
to
eat
his
hat
if
unemployment
did
n't
drop
below
three
million
a_couple_of
years
ago
.
He
lost
,
but
settled
for
a
cake
in
the
shape
of
a
fedora
.
His
successor
,
Secretary_Goldberg
,
also
has
been
guessing
wrong
on
a
drop
in
the
unemployment
rate
which
has
been
holding
just
under
7
per_cent
for
the
last
11
months
.
No
betting
man
,
Mr._Goldberg
says
he
's
merely
``
putting
my
neck
out
again
''
by
predicting
the
rate
will
go_down
this
month
.
He
is
basing
his
guess
on
new
government
statistics
that
show
business
has
broadened
its
stride
-
a
new
record
high
in
personal_income
,
an
increase
in
housing
starts
,
a
spurt
in
retail
sales
and
a
gain
in
orders
for
durable_goods
.
Mr._Mitchell
had
an
excuse
for
losing
-
the
steel
strike
lasted
much
longer
than
he
anticipated
.
Mr._Goldberg
has
less
reason
for
missing
.
The
economy
seems
to
be
sailing
along
on
an
even
keel
and
the
1961
hurricane
season
and
auto
strikes
are
at
an
end
so
they
can
n't
be
blamed
in
November
.
The
odds
thus
appear
favorable
that
the
secretary
's
neck
may
be
spared
.
Cambodia
's
chief_of_state
,
who
has
been
accused
of
harboring
Communist
marauders
and
otherwise
making
life
miserable
for
neighboring
South
Viet_Nam
and
Thailand
,
insists
he
would
be
very
unhappy
if
communism
established
its
power
in
Southeast_Asia
.
But
so
convinced
of
communism
's
inevitable
triumph
is
Prince_Sihanouk
that
he
is
ready
to
throw_in_the_towel
.
``
I
have
to
see
the
facts
''
,
is
the
way
the
prince
puts
it
.
And
from_that
point
of
vantage
he
concedes
another
two
years_of_grace
to
nations
maintaining
a
pro-Western
posture
.
Prince_Sihanouk
's
powers
of
prognostication
some_day
may
be
confirmed
but
history
is
not
likely
to
praise
the
courage
of
his
convictions
.
Commerce_Secretary_Hodges
seems
to
have
been
cast
in
the
role
of
pacemaker
for
official
Washington
's
economic
forecasters
.
Weeks
ago
he
saw
a
business
upturn
in
the
second
quarter
of_this
year
while
his
colleagues
in
the
Cabinet
were
shaking
their
heads
in_disagreement
.
Recently
Treasury_Secretary_Dillon
and
Labor_Secretary_Goldberg
fell
into
line
with
Mr._Hodges
'
appraisal
,
though
there
has
been
some
reluctance
to
do
so
at
the
White_House
.
And
now
Mr._Hodges
has
pioneered
further
into
the
economic
unknown
with
the
announcement
that
he
thinks
business
has
stopped
sliding
and
that
it
should
start
going
upward
from
this
point
.
He
is
the
first
top
administration
officer
to
see
the
bottom
of
the
slump
.
The
secretary
based
his
assessment
on
the
upturn
in
retail
sales
.
February
's
volume
was
1
per_cent
above
January
's
for
the
first
pickup
since
last
October
,
although
it
is
still
1.5
per_cent
off
from
February
1960
.
Corroborating
Mr._Hodges
'
figures
was
the
Federal_Reserve_Board
's
report
of
the
large
sales
increase
in
the
nation
's
department_stores
for
the
week
ending
March
4
.
In
Newark
,
for_example
,
this
gain
was
put
at
26
per_cent
above
the
year-earlier
level
.
Of_course
,
some
of
the
credit
for
the
sale
boost
must
be
given
to
improvement
in
the
weather
and
to
the
fact
that
Easter
comes
more_than
two_weeks
earlier
than
in
1960
.
Another
optimistic
sign
,
this
one
from
the
Labor_Department
,
was
the
report
that
the
long
rise
in
unemployment_compensation
payments
``
was
interrupted
for_the_first_time
in
the
week
ending
Feb.
25
''
.
Initial
claims
for
jobless
benefits
were
said
to
have
dropped
by
8100
in
the
week
ending
March
4
.
Mr._Hodges
is
so
hopeful
over
the
outlook
that
he
does
n't
think
there
will
be
any
need
of
a
cut
in
income_taxes
.
Well
,
we
can
n't
have
everything
.
Prosperity
for
the
whole
nation
is
certainly
preferred
to
a
tax
cut
.
New_Jersey
folk
need
not
be
told
of
the
builder
's
march
to
the
sea
,
for
in
a
single
generation
he
has
parceled
and
populated
miles
of
our
shoreline
and
presses_on
to
develop
the
few
open
spaces
that
remain
.
Now
the
Stone_Harbor
bird_sanctuary
,
31
acres
of
magic
attraction
for
exotic
herons
,
is
threatened
,
but
the
battlefront
extends
far
beyond
our
state
.
Against
the
dramatic
fight
being
waged
for
preservation
of
30
miles
of
Cape_Cod
shoreline
,
the
tiny
tract
at
Stone_Harbor
may
seem
unimportant
.
But
Interior_Secretary_Udall
warns
that
there
is
a
race
on
between
those
who
would
develop
our
few
surviving
open
shorelines
and
those
who
would
save
them
for
the
enjoyment
of
all
as
public
preserves
.
The
move
for
establishment
of
a
national
seashore
park
on
30000
acres
of
Cape_Cod
,
from
Provincetown
to
Chatham
,
is
strengthened
by
President_Kennedy
's
interest
in_that
area
.
But
preservation
of
the
natural
beauty
of
the
Cape
is
of
more_than
regional
concern
,
for
the
automobile
age
has
made
it
the
recreation
spot
of
people
from
all_over
the
country
.
By
comparison
,
Stone_Harbor
bird_sanctuary
's
allies
seem
less
formidable
,
for
aside
from
the
Audubon_Society
,
they
are
mostly
the
snowy
,
common
and
cattle_egrets
and
the
Louisiana
,
green
,
little
blue
and
black-crowned
herons
who
nest
and
feed
there
.
But
there
is
hope
,
for
Conservation_Commissioner_Bontempo
has
tagged
the
sanctuary
as
the
kind_of
place
the
state
hopes
to
include
in
its
program
to
double
its
park
space
.
The
desirability
of
preserving
such
places
as
the
Cape
dunes
and
Stone_Harbor
sanctuary
becomes
more
apparent
every_year
.
Public
sentiment
for
conserving
our
rich
natural
heritage
is
growing
.
But
that
heritage
is
shrinking
even
faster
.
Much
of
the
glamor
President_Kennedy
's
Peace_Corps
may
have
held
for
some
prospective
applicants
has
been
removed
by
Sargent_Shriver
,
the
head
corpsman
.
Anybody
who
is
expecting
a
joyride
should
,
according
to
Mr._Shriver
,
get_off
the
train
right_now
.
First_of_all
,
the
recruits
will
have
to
undergo
arduous
schooling
.
It
will
be
a
16
-
hour
training
day
.
Then
off
to
a
remote
place
in
an
underdeveloped
country
where
the
diet
,
culture
,
language
and
living
conditions
will
be
different
.
And
the
pay
,
of_course
,
will
be
nil
.
Despite
all
this
,
the
idea
apparently
has
captured
the
imagination
of
countless
youths
whose
parents
are
probably
more
surprised
by
the
response
than
anybody
else
.
