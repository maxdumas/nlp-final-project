While
no
larger
than
Dutch_Springs
,
this
mining
supply
town
had
the
appearance
of
being
far
busier
and
more
prosperous
.
Men
crowded
the
streets
and
freight
rigs
and
teams
were
moving
about
.
Although
they
were
forced
to
maintain
a
sharper
watch
,
this
activity
enabled
them
to
ride
in
and
rack
their
broncs
without
any
particular
attention
being
paid
them
.
``
Gyp
'll
be
holdin_'_forth
in
some
bar
if
he
's
here
at_all
''
,
Cobb
declared
,
glancing
along
the
street
as
they
stretched
their
legs
.
There
were
no
less
than
six
or
seven
saloons
in
Ganado
,
not
counting
the
lower_class
dives
,
all
vying
for
the
trade
of
celebrating
miners
and
teamsters
.
Pat
only
nodded
.
``
Take
one
side
of
the
street
,
and
I
'll
take
the
other
''
,
he
proposed
.
``
If
you
spot
Carmer
give
a
yell
before
you
move_in
''
.
Cobb
's
assent
was
tight
.
``
You
do
the
same
.
It
's
all
I
ask
,
Stevens
''
.
Separating
,
they
took
different
sides
of
the
main_drag
and
systematically
combed
the
bars
.
Russ
visited
two
places
without
result
and
his
blood_pressure
was
down
to
zero
.
Suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
insane
that
they
might
hope
to
locate
Gyp_Carmer
so
casually
,
even
were
he
to
prove
the
thief
.
He
tramped
out
of
the
Miners_Rest
with
his
hopes
plummeting
,
and
headed
doggedly
for
the
Palace_Saloon
,
the
last
place
of
any
consequence
on
this
side
of
the
street
.
The
Palace
was
an
elaborate
establishment
,
built
practically
on
stilts
in_front
,
with
long
flights
of
wooden
steps
running
up
to
the
porch
.
Behind
its
ornate
facade
the
notorious
dive
clung
like
a
bird
's
nest
to
the
rocky
ribs
of
the
canyonside
.
Russ
ran
up
the
steps
quickly
to
the
plank
porch
.
The
front
windows
of
the
place
were
long
and
narrow
,
reaching
nearly
to
the
floor
and
affording
an
unusually
good
view
of
the
interior
.
Heading
for
the
batwings
,
Cobb
glanced
perfunctorily
through
the
nearest
window
,
and
suddenly
dodged
aside
.
Nerves
tight
as
a
bowstring
,
he
paused
to
gather
his
wits
.
Against
all
expectation
,
Carmer
was
inside
,
clearly
enjoying
himself
to_the_hilt
and
already
so
tipsy
that
it
seemed
unlikely
he
was
bothering
to
note
anything
or
anyone
about
him
.
Fierce
anger
surged
through
Russ
.
He
fought_down
the
impulse
to
rush
in
and
collar
the
vicious
puncher
on_the_spot
.
Reaching
the
porch
rail
beyond
view
of
the
bar
windows
,
he
feverishly
scanned
the
busy
street
below
.
Stevens
was
nowhere
in_sight
.
Muffling
an
exclamation
,
Russ
sprang
to
the
nearest
steps
and
ran_down
.
As
luck
had
it
,
he
had
not
gone
twenty
feet
in
the
street
before
Pat
appeared
.
``
What
luck
,
Cobb
''
?
he
said
swiftly
.
Russ
pointed
upward
.
``
He
's
there
''
,
he
got_out
tersely
,
curbing
his
rising
excitement
.
Hitching
his
cartridge_belt
around
,
Pat
glanced
upward
briefly
at
the
Palace
and
started
that
way
with
Cobb
at
his
side
.
Climbing
the
steps
steadily
,
they
reached
the
top
and
headed
for
the
door
.
Pat
pushed_through
first
.
Forced
behind
him
momentarily
,
Russ
followed
at_once
and
halted
two
steps
inside
.
His
eyes
widened
.
While
five
minutes
ago
the
place
had
presented
a
scene
of
easy
revelry
,
with
Gyp_Carmer
a
prominent
figure
,
it
was
now
as
somnolent
and
dull
as
the
day
before
payday
.
Carmer
himself
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
A
man
knocked
the
roulette_ball
about
idly
in
its
track
,
and
another
dozed
at
one
of
the
card_tables
.
Two
men
murmured
with
their
heads
together
at
the
end
of
the
bar
,
while
the
sleek
headed
bartender
absently
polished
a
glass
.
Looking
the
setup
over
,
Stevens
started
coolly
for
the
rear
of
the
place
.
``
Where
yuh
goin
''
'
?
It
was
the
barkeep
.
Halting
,
Pat
turned
to
survey
him
deliberately
.
He
did
not
reply
,
going_on
toward
the
back
.
Less
assured
than
the
tall
,
wide
shouldered
man
in_the_lead
,
Cobb
followed
alertly
,
a
hand
on
his
gun
butt
.
The
bartender
measured
this
situation
with
heavy
eyes
and
decided
he
wanted
no
part
of
it
.
He
said
no
more
.
A
hall
opened
in
back
of
the
bar
,
running
toward
an
ell
.
Pat
moved_into
it
.
Small
rooms
,
probably
for
cards
,
opened
off
on
either
side
.
All
the
doors
were
open
at
this
hour
except
one
,
and
it
was
toward
this
that
Stevens
made
his
way
with
Russ
close
at
his
shoulder
.
The
door
was
locked
.
A
single
kick
made
it
spring
open
,
shuddering
.
Pat
saw
Gyp_Carmer
staggering
forward
,
a
half
filled
bottle
upraised
as
if
to
strike
.
Russ
sprang
through
to
bat
it
nimbly
aside
.
With
a
bellow
Carmer
lunged
at
him
.
But
he
was
more_than
half
drunk
,
and
his
faculties
were
dulled
.
Cobb
unleashed
a
single
powerful
jab
that
sent
Gyp
reeling
wildly
and
crashing
down
with
a
whining
groan
.
He
started
to
struggle
up
,
heaving
desperately
.
Russ
gave
him
a
brutal
thrust
that
tumbled
him
over
flat
on
his
stomach
.
Kneeling
,
Cobb
planted
a
sturdy
knee
in
the
small
of
his
back
,
holding
him
pinned
.
``
Okay
,
Stevens
.
I
've
drawn
his
fangs
''
,
he
snapped
.
``
Go
through
his
pockets
,
will
you
?
If
we
have
to
we
'll
take
him
apart
and
see
what
he
's
made
of
''
!
Complying
methodically
,
Pat
pulled
pocket
after
pocket
inside_out
without
finding
a
thing
.
Cobb
watched
this
with
hunted
eyes
,
his
desperate
hope
waning
by
the
moment
.
Stevens
was
grunting
over
the
last
empty
pocket
when
Russ
abruptly
rose
and
lunged
toward
Carmer
's
hat
,
which
had
tumbled
half-a-dozen
feet
away
when
he
first
fell
.
Cobb
got
it
.
Straightening_up
,
his
eyes
ablaze
,
he
held_out
the
battered
Stetson
.
``
Look
at
this
''
!
Inside
the
crown
,
stuffed
behind
the
stained
sweatband
,
could
be
seen
thin
,
crumpled
wads
of
currency
.
Carmer
's
ingenious
cache
for
his
loot
had
been
found
.
``
By
golly
,
Stevens
!
You
were
right
''
,
Russ
exclaimed
,
tearing
the
loose
bills
out
of
Carmer
's
hat
.
``
That_is
,
if
we
can
be
sure
this
is
Colcord
's
money
''
-
Pat
grunted
.
``
Where
else
would
he
get
it
?
Count
what
you
've
got
there
,
Cobb
.
We
can
soon
tell
''
.
Russ
ran_through
the
bills
and
named
an
amount
it
was
highly
unlikely
any
cowpuncher
would
come_by
honestly
.
Pat
nodded
.
``
It
's
within
a_hundred
of
what
Crip
had
''
,
he
declared
.
``
We
know
Penny
spent
some
-
and
Carmer
must
have
dropped
a_few
dollars
getting
that
load
on
''
.
Handing
the
money
over
,
Russ
wiped
his
hands
on
his
pants-legs
as
if
ridding
himself
of
something
unclean
.
His
glance
at
Gyp_Carmer
was
disdainful
.
``
Shall
we
get_out
of
here
''
?
Leaving
the
card_room
,
they
moved_back
through
the
Palace
the
way
they
had
come
.
Glowering
looks
met
them
in
the
bar
,
but
there
was
no
attempt
to
halt
them
.
Pausing
in
the
outside_door
to
glance
behind
him
,
Pat
looked
his
unspoken
warning
and
stepped_out
.
He
and
Cobb
clattered
down
the
high
steps
to
the
street
.
Neither
spoke
till
they
reached
their
horses
.
Pat
paused
there
,
looking_across
at
the
young
fellow
.
It
'll
be
a
pleasure
for
you
to
return
this
money
to
Colcord
and
tell
him
about
it
,
Russ
``
.
He
started
to
return
it
.
To
his
faint
surprise
Russ
held_up
his
hand
.
``
Not
me
''
,
he
ruled
decidedly
.
I
've
had
enough
.
It
was
you
that
tracked
it
down
anyway
,
Stevens
``
,
he
pursued
strictly
.
''
I
'll
shove_along
home
``
.
``
Whatever
you
say
''
.
Pat
swung
into
the
saddle
,
yet
still
he
delayed
,
his
brows
puckered
.
``
You
owe
it
to
Penny
to
give
her
a
chance
to
explain
that
she
was
defending
you
,
really
''
,
he
observed
mildly
.
``
Old_Crip
was
n't
''
,
retorted
Cobb
tartly
.
``
He
'll
know
when
you
tell
him
.
But
I
want
this
to
sink_in
awhile
.
Then
maybe
next
time
he
won
n't
be
so
quick
on
the
trigger
''
.
``
Pat
had
never
pretended
to
give
advice
in
such
affairs
.
''
You
're
the
doctor
``
,
he
returned
with
a
smile
.
''
But
I
still
think
Penny
's
an
awful
nice
girl
,
Russ
``
-
``
You
do
n't
have
to
tell
me
''
,
flashed
Cobb
.
Giving
the
other
a
dark
look
,
he
hauled
his
bronc
around
and
trotted
down
off
the
street
.
Pat
let
him
go
,
following
more
leisurely
.
At
the
first
restaurant
he
sensibly
pulled_up
to
go_in
for
his
dinner
,
and
as
a
consequence
did
not
see
Cobb
strike
the
open
range
at
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
and
head
straight
across
the
swells
for
Antler
.
The
truth
was
,
the
puncher
was
both
bewildered
and
dismayed
by
his
own
mixed
luck
.
``
Penny
's
always
glad
to
see
me
over
there
''
,
he
mused
bleakly
.
Yet
had
he
not
visited
the
girl
at
Saw_Buck
he
would
never
have
been
involved
in
this
latest
tangle
.
Over
and
above
that
,
however
,
was
his
growing
suspicion
of
Chuck_Stober
's
part
in
recent
events
.
``
Gyp_Carmer
could
n't
have
known
about
Colcord
's
money
unless
he
was
told
-
and
who
else
would
have
told
him
''
?
he
asked
himself
.
``
It
's
the
second
time
War_Ax
hands
made
a
play
for
that
money
.
How
much
of
an
accident
could
that
be
``
?
Nearing
home
,
he
jerked
to
attention
at
the
distant
crack
of
a
gun
.
In
town
no
one
paid
much
attention
to
an
occasional
shot
;
but
on
the
range
gunfire
had
a
meaning
.
Hauling_up
,
Russ
listened
carefully
.
Two
minutes
later
it
came
again
-
a
double
explosion
,
followed
by
a
third
,
sounding
more
distant
.
As_near_as
Cobb
could
determine
the
shots
came
from
the
direction
of
the
Antler
ranch_house
.
He
tightened_up
in
a
twinkling
.
So_far_as
he
knew
,
only
his
father
could
be
there
.
What
did
it
mean
?
Clapping
spurs
to
the
bronc
he
set_off
at
a
sharp
canter
,
with
growing
alarm
.
His
first
glimpse
of
the
ranch_house
across
the
brushy
swells
told
him
nothing
.
Still
a
quarter-mile
away
,
the
fresh
clap
of
guns
only
served
to
increase
his
speed
.
Setting
a
course
straight
for
the
house
,
he
was
covering
ground
fast
when
an
angry
bee
buzzed
past
close
to
his
face
.
When
it
was
followed
by
a
second
,
whining
even
closer
,
Cobb
swerved
sharply
aside
into
a
depression
.
He
knew
now
what
he
was
up
against
.
Whoever
was
out
there
hiding
in
the
brushy
cover
was
besieging
the
Antler
house
and
,
having
spotted
his
approach
,
was
determined
to
drive
him
off
before
he
could
get_into
the
fight
.
Cursing
himself
for
having
ridden
out
the
last
few
days
without
a
rifle
in
his
saddle
boot
,
Russ
drew
his
Colt
and
examined
it
briefly
.
If
he
wondered
whether
the
attackers
would
allow
him
to
pull
away
unmolested
,
he
had
his
answer
a
moment
later
.
``
Over
this
way
!
He
ai
n't
gone
far
''
!
a
harsh
cry
floated
to
him
across
the
brush
.
A
carbine
cracked
more
loudly
,
and
a
slug
clipped
fragments
from
the
brush
off
at
one
side
.
The
would-be
assassin
had
his
position
figured
pretty
close
.
Dismounting
,
Russ
looked
about
hastily
.
Toward
the
west
this
depression
led
toward
a
draw
.
Leading
his
pony
,
he
hurried
that
way
,
not
remounting
till
he
was
well
below
the
level
of
the
surrounding
range
.
Swinging
up
then
,
and
bending
forward
over
the
horn
,
he
urged
his
mount
down
the
meandering
draw
.
He
had
not
covered
a_hundred
yards
before
a
gun
crashed
from
somewhere
behind
.
He
had
been
sighted
,
and
his
attacker
pumping
shot
after
shot
.
A
shot
or
two
went
wild
before
Cobb
felt
something
tug
at
his
foot
.
A
slug
had
torn
half
of
his
stirrup
guard
away
.
A
second
twitched
his
shirtsleeve
,
and
he
felt
a
brief
burn
on
his
upper
arm
.
Another
snarled
close
overhead
.
``
Jumping_Jerusalem
!
Let
's
get_out
of
here
''
!
At
the
first
shot
Russ
had
hurled
his
mount
to
the
left
toward
the
side
of
the
winding
draw
.
The
long
minute
before
he
reached
effective
cover
seemed
endless
.
Sweeping
a
look
around
,
he
saw
that
he
was
safe
for_the_moment
.
He
heard
cries
from
behind
him
,
but
he
could
make_out
no
words
.
He
dashed
madly
for
the
next
elbow
turn
in
the
draw
,
and
made_it
.
Recklessly
hurling
the
bronc
sidewise
into
an
intersecting
draw
,
he
plunged
forward
with
undiminished
speed
.
Gradually
the
wash
climbed
upward
,
forcing
him
toward
open
range
.
Yet
he
must
chance
it
.
He
clambered
out
of
the
dwindling
wash
,
the
loose
dirt
flying
behind
him
,
and
flashed
a
look
about
.
