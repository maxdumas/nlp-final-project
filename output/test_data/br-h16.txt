A
former
du_Pont
official
became
a
General_Motors
vice_president
and
set_about
maximizing
du_Pont
's
share
of
the
General_Motors
market
.
Lines
of
communications
were
established
between
the
two
companies
and
several
du_Pont
products
were
actively
promoted
.
Within
a_few
years
various
du_Pont
manufactured
items
were
filling
the
entire
requirements
of
from
four
to
seven
of
General_Motors
'
eight
operating
divisions
.
The
Fisher_Body
division
,
long
controlled
by
the
Fisher
brothers
under
a
voting_trust
even
though
General_Motors
owned
a
majority
of
its
stock
,
followed
an
independent
course
for
many
years
,
but
by
1947
and
1948
``
resistance
had
collapsed
''
and
its
purchases
from
du_Pont
``
compared
favorably
''
with
purchases
by
other
General_Motors
divisions
.
Competitors
came
to
receive
higher
percentage
of
General_Motors
business
in
later
years
,
but
it
is
``
likely
''
that
this
trend
stemmed
``
at_least
in
part
''
from
the
needs
of
General_Motors
outstripping
du_Pont
's
capacity
.
``
The
fact
that
sticks_out
in
this
voluminous
record
is
that
the
bulk
of
du_Pont
's
production
has
always
supplied
the
largest
part
of
the
requirements
of
the
one
customer
in
the
automobile_industry
connected
to
du_Pont
by
a
stock
interest
.
The
inference
is
overwhelming
that
du_Pont
's
commanding
position
was
promoted
by
its
stock
interest
and
was
not
gained
solely
on
competitive
merit
''
.
353_U._S._,_at_605
.
This
Court
agreed
with
the
trial_court
``
that
considerations
of
price
,
quality
and
service
were
not
overlooked
by
either
du_Pont
or
General_Motors
''
.
353_U._S._,_at_606
.
However
,
it
determined
that
neither
this
factor
,
nor
``
the
fact
that
all
concerned
in
high
executive
posts
in
both
companies
acted
honorably
and
fairly
,
each
in
the
honest
conviction
that
his
actions
were
in
the
best
interests
of
his
own
company
and
without
any
design
to
overreach
anyone
,
including
du_Pont
's
competitors
''
,
353_U._S._,_at_607
,
outweighed
the
Government
's
claim
for
relief
.
This
claim
,
as
submitted
to
the
District_Court
and
dismissed
by
it
,
126_F._Supp
.235
,
alleged
violation
not_only
of
7
of
the
Clayton_Act
,
but
also
of
1
and
2
of
the
Sherman_Act
.
The
latter
provisions
proscribe
any
contract
,
combination
,
or
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
interstate
or
foreign
trade
,
and
monopolization
of
,
or
attempts
,
combinations
,
or
conspiracies
to
monopolize
,
such
trade
.
However
,
this
Court
put
to
one
side
without
consideration
the
Government
's
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
its
Sherman_Act
allegations
.
It
rested
its
decision
solely
on
7
,
which
reads
in
pertinent
part
:
``
[
N_]_o
corporation
engaged
in
commerce
shall
acquire
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
stock
or
other
share
capital
of
another
corporation
engaged
also
in
commerce
,
where
the
effect
of
such
acquisition
may
be
to
substantially
lessen
competition
between
the
corporation
whose
stock
is
so
acquired
and
the
corporation
making
the
acquisition
,
or
to
restrain
such
commerce
in
any
section
or
community
,
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
of
any
line
of
commerce
.
This
section
shall
not
apply
to
corporations
purchasing
such
stock
solely
for
investment
and
not
using
the
same
by
voting
or
otherwise
to
bring_about
,
or
in
attempting
to
bring_about
,
the
substantial
lessening
of
competition
``
.
The
purpose
of_this
provision
was
thus
explained
in
the
Court
's
opinion
:
``
Section
7
is
designed
to
arrest
in
its
incipiency
not_only
the
substantial
lessening
of
competition
from
the
acquisition
by
one
corporation
of
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
stock
of
a
competing
corporation
,
but
also
to
arrest
in
their
incipiency
restraints
or
monopolies
in
a
relevant
market
which
,
as
a
reasonable
probability
,
appear
at
the
time
of
suit
likely
to
result
from
the
acquisition
by
one
corporation
of
all
or
any
part
of
the
stock
of
any
other
corporation
.
The
section
is
violated
whether
or
not
actual
restraints
or
monopolies
,
or
the
substantial
lessening
of
competition
,
have
occurred
or
are
intended
''
.
353_U._S._,_at_589
.
Thus
,
a
finding
of
conspiracy
to
restrain
trade
or
attempt
to
monopolize
was
excluded
from
the
Court
's
decision
.
Indeed
,
as
already
noted
,
the
Court
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
the
executives
involved
in
the
dealings
between
du_Pont
and
General_Motors
acted
``
honorably
and
fairly
''
and
exercised
their
business
judgment
only
to
serve
what
they
deemed
the
best
interests
of
their
own
companies
.
This
,
however
,
did
not
bar
finding
that
du_Pont
had
become
pre-eminent
as
a
supplier
of
automotive
fabrics
and
finishes
to
General_Motors
;
that
these
products
constituted
a
``
line
of
commerce
''
within
the
meaning
of
the
Clayton_Act
;
that
General_Motors
'
share
of
the
market
for
these
products
was
substantial
;
and
that
competition
for
this
share
of
the
market
was
endangered
by
the
financial
relationship
between
the
two
concerns
:
``
The
statutory
policy
of
fostering
free
competition
is
obviously
furthered
when
no
supplier
has
an
advantage
over
his
competitors
from
an
acquisition
of
his
customer
's
stock
likely
to
have
the
effects
condemned
by
the
statute
.
We
repeat
,
that
the
test
of
a
violation
of
7
is
whether
,
at
the
time
of
suit
,
there
is
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
acquisition
is
likely
to
result
in
the
condemned
restraints
.
The
conclusion
upon
this
record
is
inescapable
that
such
likelihood
was
proved
as
to
this
acquisition
''
.
353_U._S._,_at_607
.
On
the
basis
of
the
findings
which
led
to
this
conclusion
,
the
Court
remanded
the
case
to
the
District_Court
to
determine
the
appropriate
relief
.
The
sole
guidance
given
the
Court
for
discharging
the
task
committed
to
it
was
this
:
``
The
judgment
must
therefore
be
reversed
and
the
cause
remanded
to
the
District_Court
for
a
determination
,
after
further
hearing
,
of
the
equitable
relief
necessary
and
appropriate
in
the
public
interest
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
the
acquisition
offensive
to
the
statute
.
The
District_Courts
,
in
the
framing
of
equitable
decrees
,
are
clothed
'
with
large
discretion
to
model
their
judgments
to
fit
the
exigencies
of
the
particular
case

''
.
353_U._S._,_at_607_-_608
.
This
brings
us
to
the
course
of
the
proceedings
in
the
District_Court
.
This
Court
's
judgment
was
filed
in
the
District_Court
on
July
18
,
1957
.
The
first
pretrial
conference
-
held
to
appoint
amici_curiae
to
represent
the
interest
of
the
stockholders
of
du_Pont
and
General_Motors
and
to
consider
the
procedure
to
be
followed
in
the
subsequent
hearings
-
took_place
on
September
25
,
1957
.
At
the
outset
,
the
Government
's
spokesman
explained
that
counsel
for
the
Government
and
for
du_Pont
had
already
held
preliminary
discussions
with
a
view
to
arriving
at
a
relief
plan
that
both
sides
could
recommend
to
the
court
.
Du_Pont
,
he
said
,
had
proposed
disenfranchisement
of
its
General_Motors
stock
along
with
other
restrictions
on
the
du_Pont-General_Motors
relationship
.
The
Government
,
deeming
these
suggestions
inadequate
,
had
urged
that
any
judgment
include
divestiture
of
du_Pont
's
shares
of
General_Motors
.
Counsel
for
the
Government
invited
du_Pont
's
views
on
this
proposal
before
recommending
a
specific
program
,
but
stated
that
if
the
court
desired
,
or
if
counsel
for
du_Pont
thought
further
discussion
would
not
be
profitable
,
the
Government
was
prepared
to
submit
a
plan
within
thirty
days
.
Counsel
for
du_Pont
indicated
a
preference
for
the
submission
of
detailed
plans
by
both
sides
at
an
early
date
.
No
previous
antitrust_case
,
he
said
,
had
involved
interests
of
such
magnitude
or
presented
such
complex
problems
of
relief
.
The
submission
of
detailed
plans
would
place
the
issues
before
the
court
more
readily
than
would
discussion
of
divestiture
or
disenfranchisement
in
the
abstract
.
The
Court
adopted
this
procedure
with
an
appropriate
time
schedule
for
carrying
it
out
.
The
Government
submitted
its
proposed
decree
on
October
25
,
1957
.
The
plan
called_for
divestiture
by
du_Pont
of
its
63000000
shares
of
General_Motors
stock
by
equal
annual
distributions
to
its
stockholders
,
as
a
dividend
,
over
a
period
of
ten
years
.
Christiana_Securities_Company
and
Delaware_Realty_+_Investment_Company
,
major
stockholders
in
du_Pont
,
and
the
stockholders
of
Delaware
were
dealt
with
specially
by
provisions
requiring
the
annual
sale
by
a
trustee
,
again
over
a
ten
year
period
,
of
du_Pont
's
General_Motors
stock
allocable
to
them
,
as_well_as
any
General_Motors
stock
which
Christiana
and
Delaware
owned
outright
.
If
,
in
the
trustee
's
judgment
,
``
reasonable
market
conditions
''
did
not
prevail
during
any
given
year
,
he
was
to
be
allowed
to
petition
the
court
for
an
extension
of
time
within
the
ten
year
period
.
In_addition
,
the
right_to_vote
the
General_Motors
stock
held
by
du_Pont
was
to
be
vested
in
du_Pont
's
stockholders
,
other_than
Christiana
and
Delaware
and
the
stockholders
of
Delaware
;
du_Pont
,
Christiana
,
and
Delaware
were
to
be
enjoined
from
acquiring
stock
in
or
exercising
control
over
General_Motors
;
du_Pont
,
Christiana
,
and
Delaware
were
to
be
prohibited
to
have
any
director
or
officer
in_common
with
General_Motors
,
and
vice_versa
;
and
General_Motors
and
du_Pont
were
to
be
ordered
to
terminate
any
agreement
that
provided_for
the
purchase
by
General_Motors
of
any
specified
percentage
of
its
requirements
of
any
du_Pont
manufactured
product
,
or
for
the
grant
of
exclusive
patent_rights
,
or
for
a
grant
by
General_Motors
to
du_Pont
of
a
preferential
right
to
make
or
sell
any
chemical
discovery
of
General_Motors
,
or
for
the
maintenance
of
any
joint
commercial_enterprise
by
the
two
companies
.
On
motion
of
the
amici_curiae
,
the
court
directed
that
a
ruling
be
obtained
from
the
Commissioner_of_Internal_Revenue
as
to
the
federal
income_tax
consequences
of
the
Government
's
plan
.
On
May
9
,
1958
,
the
Commissioner
announced
his
rulings
.
The
annual
dividends
paid
to
du_Pont
stockholders
in
shares
of
General_Motors
stock
would
be
taxable
as
ordinary
income
to
the
extent
of
du_Pont
's
earnings
and
profits
.
The
measure
,
for
federal
income_tax
purposes
,
of
the
dividend
to
individual
stockholders
would
be
the
fair
market_value
of
the
shares
at
the
time
of
each
annual
distribution
.
In
the
case
of
taxpaying
corporate
stockholders
,
the
measure
would
be
the
lesser
of
the
fair
market_value
of
the
shares
or
du_Pont
's
tax
basis
for
them
,
which
is
approximately
$
2.09
per
share
.
The
forced_sale
of
the
General_Motors
stock
owned
by
or
allocable
to
Christiana
,
Delaware
,
and
the
stockholders
of
Delaware
,
and
deposited
with
the
trustee
,
would
result
in
a
tax
to
those
parties
at
the
capital_gains
rate
.
Du_Pont
's
counterproposal
was
filed
on
May
14
,
1958
.
Under
its
plan
du_Pont
would
retain
its
General_Motors
shares
but
be
required
to
pass_on
to
its
stockholders
the
right_to_vote
those
shares
.
Christiana
and
Delaware
would
,
in_turn
,
be
required
to
pass_on
the
voting_rights
to
the
General_Motors
shares
allocable
to
them
to
their
own
stockholders
.
Du_Pont
would
be
enjoined
from
having
as
a
director
,
officer
,
or
employee
anyone
who
was
simultaneously
an
officer
or
employee
of
General_Motors
,
and
no
director
,
officer
,
or
employee
of
du_Pont
could
serve
as
a
director
of
General_Motors
without
court
approval
.
Du_Pont
would
be
denied
the
right
to
acquire
any
additional
General_Motors
stock
except
through
General_Motors
'
distributions
of
stock
or
subscription_rights
to
its
stockholders
.
On
June
6
,
1958
,
General_Motors
submitted
its
objections
to
the
Government
's
proposal
.
It
argued
,
inter_alia
,
that
a
divestiture
order
would
severely
depress
the
market_value
of
the
stock
of
both
General_Motors
and
du_Pont
,
with
consequent
serious
loss
and
hardship
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
innocent
investors
,
among
them
thousands
of
small
trusts
and
charitable
institutions
;
that
there
would
be
a
similar
decline
in
the
market_values
of
other
automotive
and
chemical
stocks
,
with
similar
losses
to
the
stockholders
of
those
companies
;
that
the
tremendous
volume
of
General_Motors
stock
hanging
over
the
market
for
ten
years
would
hamper
the
efforts
of
General_Motors
and
other
automobile
manufacturers
to
raise
equity
capital
;
and
that
all
this
would
have
a
serious
adverse
effect
on
the
entire
stock_market
and
on
general
business_activity
.
General_Motors
comprehensively
contended
that
the
Government
plan
would
not
be
``
in
the
public
interest
''
as_required
by
the
mandate
of_this
Court
.
The
decrees
proposed
by
the
amici_curiae
were
filed
in
August
of
1958
.
These
plans
,
like
du_Pont
's
contained
provisions
for
passing
the
vote
on
du_Pont
's
General_Motors
shares
on
to
the
ultimate
stockholders
of
du_Pont
,
Christiana
,
and
Delaware
,
except
that
officers
and
directors
of
the
three
companies
,
their
spouses
,
and
other
people
living
in
their
households
,
as_well_as
other
specified
persons
,
were
to
be
totally
disenfranchised
.
Both
plans
also
prohibited
common
directors
,
officers
,
or
employees
between
du_Pont
,
Christiana
,
and
Delaware
,
on_the_one_hand
,
and
General_Motors
on_the_other
.
