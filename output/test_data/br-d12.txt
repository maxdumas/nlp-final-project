Much
more_than
shelter
,
housing
symbolizes
social_status
,
a
sense
of
``
belonging
''
,
acceptance
within
a
given
group
or
neighborhood
,
identification
with
particular
cultural
values
and
social
institutions
,
feelings
of
pride
and
worth
,
aspirations
and
hopes
basic
to
human
well-being
.
For
almost
one-sixth
of
the
national
population
discrimination
in
the
free
selection
of
residence
casts
a
considerable
shadow
upon
these
values
assumed
as
self-evident
by
most
Americans
.
Few
business
groups
in
recent
years
have
come
under
heavier
pressure
to
face
these
realities
than
real_estate_brokers
and
home
builders
.
This
pressure
has
urged
re-evaluation
of
the
assumptions
underlying
their
professional
ethics
;
it
has
sought
new
sympathy
for
the
human
aspirations
of
racial
minority
groups
in_this
country
.
It
is
not
surprising
that
,
as
spokesman
for
real_estate
interests
,
the
National_Association
of
Real_Estate
Boards
(
NAREB
)
and
its
local
associations
have
sought
to
limit
and
often
ignore
much
of_this
pressure
.
How
does
the
local
realtor
see
himself
in
the
context
of
housing
restrictions
based
on
race
,
religion
or
ethnic
attachment
?
What
does
he
conceive
his
role
to
be
in_this
area
of
social
unrest
?
What
ought
to
be
,
what
is
his
potential
role
as
a
force
for
constructive
social
change
?
What
social
,
ethical
and
theological
insights
can
the
church
and
university
help
him
bring_to_bear
upon
his
situation
?
Recently
,
a
group
of
the
faculty
at
Wesleyan_University
's
Public_Affairs_Center
sought
some
answers
to
these
questions
.
Several
New_England
realtors
were
invited
to
participate
in
a
small
colloquium
of
property
lawyers
,
political_scientists
,
economists
,
social
psychologists
,
social
ethicists
and
theologians
.
Here
,
in
an
atmosphere
of
forthrightness
and
mutual
criticism
,
each
sought
to
bring
his
particular
insights
to
bear_upon
the
question
of
discrimination
in
housing
and
the
part
each
man
present
played
in
it
.
For
a_number_of
years
,
Wesleyan
has
been
drawing
varied
groups
of
political
and
business_leaders
into
these
informal
discussions
with
members
of
the
faculty
and
student
body
,
attempting
to
explore
and
clarify
aspects
of
their
responsibility
for
public
policy
.
This
article
presents
our
observations
of_that
session
,
of
the
realtors
as
they
saw
themselves
and
as
the
faculty
and
students
saw
them
.
Such
conversation
quickly
reveals
an
ethically
significant
ambivalence
in
the
self-images
held
by
most
realtors
.
Within
the
membership
of_this
group
,
as
has
been
found
true
of
men
in
other
professional
or
trade
associations
,
the_most
ready
portrayal
of
oneself
to
``
the
public
''
is
that
of
a
neutral
agent
simply
serving
the
interests
of
a
seller
or
buyer
and
mediating
between
them
.
Professional
responsibility
is
seen
to
consist
largely
in
serving
the
wishes
of
the
client
fairly
and
in
an
efficient
manner
.
But
as
conversation
goes_on
,
particularly
among
the
realtors
themselves
,
another
image
emerges
,
that
of
considerable
power
and
influence
in
the
community
.
Obviously
,
much
more_than
customer
expectation
is
determining
the
realtor
's
role
.
Judgments
are
continually
rendered
regarding
the
potential
buyers
'
income
,
educational
level
and
above_all
,
racial
extraction
;
and
whether
these
would
qualify
them
for
``
congenial
''
,
``
happy
''
relations_to
other
people
in
certain
community
areas
.
How
explicit
such
factors
have
been
historically
is
evident
in
any
chronology
of
restrictive
covenant
cases
or
in
a
review
of
NAREB
's
Code
of
Ethics
Article
34
in
the
Code
,
adopted
in
1924
,
states
that
``
a
Realtor
should
never
be
instrumental
in
introducing
into
a
neighborhood
a
character
of
property
or
occupancy
,
members
of
any
race
or
nationality
,
or
any
individuals
whose
presence
will
clearly
be
detrimental_to
property
values
in_that
neighborhood
''
.
Though
the
reference_to
race
was
stricken
by
the
association
in
1950
,
being
an
agent
of
such
``
detrimental
''
influences
still
appears
as
the
cardinal
sin
realtors
see
themselves
committed
to
avoid
.
The
rationale
for
this
avoidance
was
most
frequently
expressed
in
economic
terms
;
all
feared
the
supposed
stigma
they
believed
would
inevitably
attach_to
any
realtor
who
openly
introduced
non-white
,
particularly
Negro
,
peoples
into
all-white
,
restricted
areas
.
They
would
become
tagged
as
men
not
interested
in
being
purely
real_estate
``
professionals
''
but
agitators
for
some
kind_of
``
cause
''
or
``
reform
''
,
and
this
was
no_longer
to
be
a
``
pro
''
.
Obviously
what
we
are
confronted
with
here
is
the
identification
of
``
professional
''
with
narrow
skills
and
specialization
,
the
effective
servicing
of
a
client
,
rather_than
responsiveness
to
the
wider
and
deeper
meaning
and
associations
of
one
's
work
.
These
men
-
for_the_most_part
educated
in
our
``
best
''
New_England
colleges
,
well
established
financially
and
socially
in
the
community
-
under
kindly
but
insistent
probing
,
reveal
little
or
no
objective
or
explicit
criteria
or
data
for
their
generalizations
about
the
interests
and
attitudes
of
the
people
they
claim
to
serve
,
or
about
the
public
responses
that
actually
follow
their
occasional
breach
of
a
``
client-service
relationship
''
.
This
narrow
``
professionalism
''
does
not
even
fit
the
present
realities
of
their
situation
,
as
the
pressure
of
minorities
and
the
power
and
respectability
of
the
realtors
increase
.
As
our
discussion
continued
,
the
inadequacy
of
the
``
client
relationship
''
as
an
interpretation
of
their
``
way
of
operating
''
became
evident
.
Realtors
live
in
their
communities
as
specialists
in
a
given
area
of
work
,
as
members
of
social
and
professional
organizations
,
as
citizens
and
civic_leaders
,
as
church
laymen
,
as
university
alumni
,
as
newspaper
readers
,
etc.
.
From
such
communal
roles
the
realtor
finds
the
substance
that
shapes
his
moral
understanding
.
It
seems
to
us
that
choices
exercised
by
realtors
in
moral
situations
center
in
at_least
three
areas
:
(
1
)
the
various
ways
in_which
they
interpret
a
particular
social
issue
;
(
2
)
their
pattern
of
involvement
in
the
regular
legal
and
political
processes
;
and
,
most
pervasively
,
(
3
)
their
interpretation
of
who
is
a
``
real
pro
''
,
of_what
it
means
to
be
a
professional
man
in
a
technical
,
fragmented
society
.
(
1
)
Most_of
the
realtors
minimized
their
own
understanding
of
and
role
in
the
racial
issue
,
pleading
that
they
only
reflect
the
attitudes
and
intentions
of
their
society
.
There
is
some
reality
to
this
;
the
Commission
on
Race
and
Housing
concluded
that
``
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
real_estate
men
are
either
more_or_less
racially
prejudiced
,
on_the_whole
,
than
any
other
segment
of
the
American
population
''
.
But
such
a
reaction
obscures
the
powerful
efforts
made
in_the_past
by
both
NAREB
and
its
local
boards
for
the
maintenance
of
restrictive
clauses
and
practices
.
Also
,
it
does
not
recognize
the
elements
of
choice
and
judgment
continually
employed
.
Like
business
and
university
groups
generally
,
these
men
had
very
limited
knowledge
of
recent
sociological
and
psychological
studies
and
findings
that
might
illumine
the
decisions
they
make
.
Realtors
,
both
generally
and
in_this
group
,
have
invariably
equated
residential
integration
with
a
decline
in
property
values
,
a
circumstance
viewed
with
considerable
apprehension
.
Recent
studies
by
the
Commission
on
Race
and
Housing
and_others
,
however
,
point
to
a
vast
complex
of
factors
that
often
do
not
warrant
this
conclusion
.
There
are
increasing
numbers
of
neighborhoods
that
are
integrated
residentially
without
great
loss
of
property
values
,
the
white
population
having
taken
the
initiative
in
preparing
the
areas
for
an
appreciation
of
the
Negroes
'
desire
for
well-kept
housing
,
privacy
,
etc.
.
Data
on
the
decline
of
property
values
in
an
area
after
a
new
racial
group
enters
it
has
to
be
assessed
in_terms_of
the
trends
in
property
values
before
the
group
comes_in
.
Often
they
are
able
to
get_in
only
because
the
area
is
declining
economically
.
Significantly
,
no
realtor
and
few
of
the
faculty
present
were
familiar
with
any
of
the
six
volumes
(
published
by
the
University
of
California_Press
)
that
present
the
commission
's
findings
.
No
one
anticipates
any
radical
shift
in_this
situation
,
but
questions
concerning
reading
habits
,
the
availability
of
such
data
and
the
places
where
it
is
discussed
must
surely
be
raised
.
The
role
of
both
church
and
university
as
sources
of
information
and
settings
within
which
the
implications
of
such
information
may
be
explored
needs
consideration
.
Relevant
``
facts
''
,
however
,
extend
beyond
considerations
of
property
values
and
maintenance
of
``
harmonious
''
neighborhoods
.
Discussion
of
minority
housing
necessarily
involves
such
basic
issues
as
the
intensity
of
one
's
democratic
conviction
and
religious_belief
concerning
equality
of
opportunity
,
the
function
and
limitations
of
government
in
the
securing
of
such
equality
,
and
the
spotlight
that
world
opinion
plays
upon
local
incidents
of
racial
agitation
and
strife
.
(
2
)
Realtors
realize
,
of_course
,
that
they
are
involved
in
an
increasingly
complex
legal
and
political_system
that_is
opening_up
opportunities
for
leverage
on
their
relation_to
clients
as_well
as
opportunities
for
evasion
of
their
responsibility
for
racial
discrimination
in
housing
.
On
the
positive
side
,
recent
Federal
action
has
largely
undermined
the
legal
sanction
so_long
enjoyed
by
the
segregationist
position
;
anti-discriminatory
statutes
in
housing
have
now
been
adopted
by
thirteen
states
and
,
while
specific
provisions
have
varied
,
the
tendency
is
clearly
toward
expanding
coverage
.
Realtors
in_attendance
at
the
colloquium
expressed
interest
,
for_example
,
in
Connecticut
's
new
housing
law
as
setting
standards
of
equity
that
they
would
like
``
to
have
to
obey
''
,
but
in
support
of_which
none
had
been
willing
to
go
on
public
record
.
As
far
as
they
were
aware
,
the
Connecticut_Association
of
Real_Estate
Boards
had
not
officially
opposed
the
bill
's
passage
or
lobbied
in
its
support
.
(
This
has
not
been
the
case
everywhere
.
In
1957
,
the
Real_Estate
Boards
of
New_York_City
actively
opposed
the
then
pending
private
housing
anti-discrimination
law
.
Official
reasoning
:
the
bill
was
a
``
wanton
invasion
of
basic
property_rights
''
.
)
There
are
sins
of
omission
as_well
as
commission
;
the
attitude
adopted
by
realtors
and
their
associations
,
either
negative
or
positive
,
plays
a
large
part
in
the
public
acceptance
of
such
measures
and
the
degree
to_which
they
may
be
effectively
enforced
.
Judicial
opinion
since
the
Supreme_Court
decision
on
Shelley
v.
Kraemer
(
1948
)
has
rendered
racial
restrictive
covenants
unenforcible
.
Such
a
decision
should
have
placed
a
powerful
weapon
in
the
hands
of
the
entire
housing_industry
,
but
there
is
little
evidence
that
realtors
,
or
at_least
their
associations
,
have
repudiated
the
principle
in
such
clauses
.
In
the
states
that
have
passed
laws
preventing
discrimination
in
the
sale
or
rental
of
housing
,
support
by
real_estate
associations
for
compliance
and
broadened
coverage
through
additional
legislation
could
help
remove
the
label
of
``
social
reformism
''
that
most
realtors
individually
seem
determined
to
avoid
.
But
as_yet
,
no
real_estate
board
has
been
willing
officially
to
support
such
laws
or
to
admit
the
permissibility
of
introducing
minority
buyers
into
all-white
neighborhoods
.
One
of
the
roles
of
the
social_scientist
,
ethicist
or
theologian
in
our
discussions
with
the
realtors
became
that
of
encouraging
greater
awareness
of
the
opportunities
offered
by
the
legal
and
political
processes
for
the
exercise
of
broad
social
responsibilities
in
their
work
.
But
responsiveness
to
these
opportunities
presumes
that
all_of
us
judge
the
good
as
a
human
good
and
not
simply
as
a
professional
,
white
,
American
good
.
Such
judgments
are
meaningful
only
in_so_far
as
persons
are
members
of
a
world
,
let
us
say
a
community
,
that
embraces
Scarsdale
or
Yonkers
,
but
is
also
infinitely
richer
since
it
is
all-inclusive
.
That
community
of
all
creation
is
,
then
,
the
ultimate
object
of
our
loyalty
and
the
concrete
norm
of
all
moral
judgment
.
Racial
discrimination
is
wrong
,
then
,
not
because
it
goes_against
the
grain
of
a
faculty_member
trying
to
converse
with
a_few
realtors
but
because
it
goes_against
the
grain
of
creation
and
against
the
will
of
the
Creator
.
Thus
,
moral
issues
concerning
the
nature
of
the
legal
and
political
processes
take_on
theological
dimensions
.
(
3
)
Over
the
years
,
individuals
engaged
in
the
sale
of
real_estate
have
developed
remarkable
unity
in
the
methods
and
practices
employed
.
Most
realtors
and
real_estate_brokers
talk
of
themselves
as
``
professional
people
''
with
the
cultural
and
moral
values
held
by
the
traditional
professions
.
But
what
significance
attaches_to
``
professional
''
,
beyond
the
narrow
sense
of
skillfulness
in
meeting
a
client
's
stated
needs
as
already
noted
?
Our
faculty
and
students
pressed
this
issue
more_than
any
other
.
As
a
theologian
in
the
group
pointed_out
,
a
professional
was
,
before
the
modern
period
of
technical
specialization
,
one
who
``
professed
''
to
be
a
bearer
and
critic
of
his
culture
in
the
use
of
his
particular
skills
.
