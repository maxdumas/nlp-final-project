The
fight
over
the
Warwick_School_Committee
's
appointment
of
a
coordinator

may
go
to
the
state_Supreme_Court
,
it
appeared
last
night
.
Two
members
of
the

Board_of_Education
upheld
Dr._Michael_F._Walsh
,

who
had
ruled
previously
that
the
Warwick
board
erred
when
it
named
Maurice_F._Tougas
as

education
without
first
finding
that
the
school_superintendent
's
candidate
was
not
suitable
.

had
recommended
Roger_I._Vermeersch
for

The
FBI
yesterday
arrested
on
a
perjury
charge
one
of
the
members
of
the
jury
that
failed
to
reach
a
verdict
in
the
``
Freedom_Rider
''
bus
burning
trial
four
weeks
ago
.
U._S._Attorney_Macon_Weaver
said
the
federal
complaint
,
charged
that
the
juror
gave
false
information
when
asked
about
Ku_Klux_Klan
membership
during
selection
of
jury
.
He
identified
the
man
as
Lewis_Martin_Parker
,
59
,
a
farmer
of
Hartselle
,
Ala.
.
Eight
men
were
tried
together
in
U._S._District_Court
in
Anniston
,
Ala.
,
on
charges
of
interfering
with
interstate
transportation
and
conspiracy
growing
out
of
a
white
mob
's
attack
on
a
Greyhound
bus
carrying
the
first
of
the
Freedom
Riders
.
The
bus
was
burned
outside
Anniston
.
One
of
the
eight
defendants
was
freed
on
a
directed_verdict
of
acquittal
.
A
mistrial
was
declared
in
the
case
against
the
other
seven
when
the
jury
was
unable
to
agree
on
a
verdict
.
The
arrest
of
Mr._Parker
marks
the
third
charge
of
wrongdoing
involving
the
jury
that
heard
the
case
.
The
first
incident
occurred
before
the
trial
got
under_way
when
Judge_H._Hobart_Grooms
told
the
jury
panel
he
had
heard
reports
of
jury-tampering
efforts
.
He
asked
members
of
the
panel
to
tell
him
if
anyone
outside
the
court
had
spoken_to
them
about
the
case
.
Two
members
of
the
panel
later
told
in
court
about
receiving
telephone_calls
at
their
homes
from
anonymous
persons
expressing
interest
in
the
trial
.
Neither
was
seated
on
the
jury
.
Then
,
when
the
case
went
to
the
jury
,
the
judge
excused
one
of
the
jurors
,
saying
the
juror
had
told
him
he
had
been
accosted
by
masked
men
at
his
motel
the
night
before
the
trial
opened
.
The
juror
said
the
masked
men
had
advised
him
to
be
lenient
.
The
judge
replaced
the
juror
with
an
alternate
.
No
formal
charges
have
been
filed
as
a
result
of
either
of
the
two
reported
incidents
.
At
the
opening
of
the
trial
,
the
jury
panel
was
questioned
as_a_group
by
Mr._Weaver
about
Ku_Klux_Klan
connections
.
One
member
of
the
panel
-
not
Mr._Parker
-
indicated
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
KKK
at_one_time
.
He
was
not
seated
on
the
jury
.
The
perjury
charge
against
Mr._Parker
carries
a
maximum
penalty
of
$
2000
fine
and
five
years
imprisonment
on
conviction
.
