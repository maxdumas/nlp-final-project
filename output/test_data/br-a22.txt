Emory_University
's
Board_of_Trustees
announced
Friday
that
it
was
prepared
to
accept
students
of
any
race
as
soon
as
the
state
's
tax
laws
made
such
a
step
possible
.
``
Emory_University
's
charter
and
by-laws
have
never
required
admission
or
rejection
of
students
on
the
basis
of
race
''
,
board
chairman
Henry_L._Bowden
stated
.
But
an
official
statement
adopted
by
the
33
-
man
Emory
board
at
its
annual
meeting
Friday
noted
that
state
taxing
requirements
at_present
are
a
roadblock
to
accepting
Negroes
.
The
statement
explained
that
under
the
Georgia_Constitution
and
state
law
,
tax-exempt
status
is
granted
to
educational_institutions
only
if
they
are
segregated
.
``
Emory
could
not
continue
to
operate
according
to
its
present
standards
as
an
institution
of
higher
learning
,
of
true
university
grade
,
and
meet
its
financial_obligations
,
without
the
tax-exemption
privileges
which
are
available
to_it
only
so_long
as
it
conforms_to
the
aforementioned
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
''
,
the
statement
said
.
The
statement
did
not
mention
what
steps
might
be
taken
to
overcome
the
legal
obstacles
to
desegregation
.
An
Emory
spokesman
indicated
,
however
,
that
the
university
itself
did
not
intend
to
make
any
test
of
the
laws
.
The
Georgia_Constitution
gives
the
Legislature
the
power
to
exempt
colleges
from
property
taxation
if
,
among
other
criteria
,
``
all
endowments
to
institutions
established
for
white
people
shall
be
limited
to
white
people
,
and
all
endowments
to
institutions
established
for
colored
people
shall
be
limited
to
colored
people
''
.
At_least
two
private
colleges
in
the
Atlanta
area
now
or
in_the_past
have
had
integrated
student
bodies
,
but
their
tax-exempt
status
never
has
been
challenged
by
the
state
.
Emory
is
affiliated
with
the
Methodist_Church
.
Some
church
leaders
,
both
clerical
and
lay
,
have
criticized
the
university
for
not
taking
the
lead
in
desegregation
.
The
student
newspaper
,
The
Emory_Wheel
,
as
early
as
the
fall
of
1954
called_for
desegregation
.
``
From
its
beginning
''
,
the
trustees
'
statement
said
Friday
,
``
Emory_University
has
assumed
as
its
primary
commitment
a
dedication
to
excellence
in
Christian
higher
learning
.
Teaching
,
research
and
study
,
according
to
highest
standards
,
under
Christian
influence
,
are
paramount
in
the
Emory_University
policy
.
``
As
a
private
institution
,
supported
by
generous
individuals
,
Emory_University
will
recognize
no
obligation
and
will
adopt
no
policy
that
would
conflict
with
its
purpose
to
promote
excellence
in
scholarship
and
Christian
education
.
``
There
is
not
now
,
nor
has
there
ever
been
in
Emory_University
's
charter
or
by-laws
any
requirement
that
students
be
admitted
or
rejected
on
the
basis
of
race
,
color
or
creed
.
Insofar
as
its
own
governing
documents
are
concerned
,
Emory_University
could
now
consider
applications
from
prospective
students
,
and_others
seeking
applications
from
prospective
students
,
and_others
seeking
the
opportunity
to
study
or
work
at
the
university
,
irrespective_of
race
,
color
or
creed
.
``
On_the_other_hand
,
Emory_University
derives
its
corporate
existence
from
the
State
of
Georgia
.
``
When
and
if
it
can
do
so
without
jeopardizing
constitutional
and
statutory
tax-exemption
privileges
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
its
educational
program
and
facilities
,
Emory_University
will
consider
applications
of
persons
desiring
to
study
or
work
at
the
University
without

,
continuing
university
policy
that
all
applications
shall
be
considered
on
the
basis

A
young_man
was
killed
and
two
others
injured
at
midnight
Friday
when
the
car
they
were
riding
slid
into
a
utility
pole
on
Lake_Avenue
near
Waddell_Street
,
NE
,
police
said
.
The
dead
youth
was
identified
as
Robert_E._Sims
,
19
,
of
1688
Oak_Knoll_Cir.
,
SE
.
Patrolman_G._E._Hammons
said
the
car
evidently
slid
out_of_control
on
rain-slick
streets
and
slammed
into
the
pole
.
The
other
occupants
were
James_Willard_Olvey
,
18
,
of
963
Ponce
de
Leon_Ave.
,
NE
,
and
Larry_Coleman_Barnett
,
19
,
of

Hill_St.
,
SE
,
both
of
whom
were
treated
at
Grady_Hospital
for
severe
lacerations
and
bruises
.
The
Atlanta_Negro
student
movement
renewed
its
demands
for
movie_theater
integration
Friday
and
threatened
picketing
and
``
stand-ins
''
if
negotiations
failed
.
The
demands
were
set_forth
in
letters
to
seven
owners
of
first-run
theaters
by
the
Committee
on
Appeal
for
Human_Rights
.
``
We
intend
to
attend
the
downtown
theaters
before
the
first
of
the
year
''
,
the
identically
worded
letters
said
.
The
letters
set
a
Nov.
15
deadline
for
the
start
of
negotiations
.
They
indicated
that
stand-ins
and
picketing
would
be
started
if
theater
owners
failed
to
cooperate
.
Downtown
and
art
theater
managers
and
owners
,
contacted
Friday
night
for
comment
on
the
COAHR
request
,
said
they
had
no
knowledge
of
such
a
letter
,
and
that
it
was
not
in
the
Friday
mail
.
However
,
three
of
the
managers
did
say
that
they
would
agree
to
attend
the
proposed
meeting
if
all_of
the
other
managers
decided
to
attend
.
The
COAHR
letter
comes
on
the
eve
of
a
large
gathering
of
theater
managers
and
owners
scheduled
to
begin
here
Sunday
.
Several
theater
operators
said
,
however
,
that
there
is
little
likelihood
of
the
subject
being
discussed
during
the
three-day
affair
.
Student
leaders
began
sporadic
efforts
to
negotiate
theater
integration
several
months
ago
.
Charles_A._Black
,
COAHR
chairman
,
said
Friday
that
three
theater
representatives
had
agreed
to
meet
with
the
students
on
Oct.
31
but
had
failed
to
show_up
.
He
declined
to
name
the
three
.
Friday
's
letters
asked
for
a
Nov.
15
meeting
.
Failure
to
attend
the
meeting
or
explain
inability
to
attend
,
the
letters
said
,
would
be
considered
a
``
sign
of
indifference
''
.
Black
said
COAHR
``
hoped
to
be
able
to
integrate
the
theaters
without
taking
direct_action
,
but
we
are
pledged
to
using
every
legal
and
nonviolent
means
at
our
disposal
''
.
A
prepared
statement
released
by
the
student
group
Friday
stated
that
``
extensive
research
by
COAHR
into
techniques
and
methods
of
theater
integration
in
other
cities
indicated
that
the
presence
of
picket_lines
and
stand-ins
before
segregated
theaters
causes
a
drop
in
profits
''
.
Besides
managers
of
downtown
theaters
,
the
students
sent
letters
to
owners
of
art
theaters
in
the
uptown
area
and
Buckhead
.

Georgia
's
Department_of_Agriculture
is
intensifying
its
fire_ant
eradication
program
in
an
effort
to
stay
ahead
of
the
fast-spreading
pest
.
The
department
is
planning
to
expand
its
eradication
program
soon
to
four
additional
counties
-
Troup
,
Pierce
,
Bryan
and
Bulloch
-
to
treat
132000
acres
infested
by
the
ants
,
according
to
W._E._Blasingame
state
entomologist
.
Low-flying
planes
will
spread
a
granular-type
chemical
,
heptachlor
,
over
30000
acres
in
Troup
,
37000
acres
in
Pierce
and
65000
acres
in
Bulloch
and
Bryan
counties
.
The
eradication
effort
is
being
pushed
in
Bibb
and
Jones
counties
,
over
37679
acres
.
The
department
has
just
finished
treating
20000
acres
in
urban_areas
of
Macon
.
Also
being
treated
are
Houston
,
Bleckley
,
Tift
,
Turner
and
Dodge
counties
,
Blasingame
said
.
The
fire_ant
is
thought
to
infest
approximately
two
million
acres
of
land
in
Georgia
,
attacking
crops
,
young
wildlife
and
livestock
and
can
be
a
serious
health
menace
to
humans
who
are
allergic
to
its
venom
,
Blasingame
said
.
The
north-bound
entrance
to
the
Expressway
at
14
th
Street
will
be
closed
during
the
afternoon
rush
traffic
hours
this
week
.
This
is
being
done
so_that
Georgia_Tech
can
complete
the
final
phase
of
a
traffic
survey
on
the
North_Expressway
.
Students
have
been
using
electric
computers
and
high
speed
movie_cameras
during
the
study
.
Perhaps
the
engineers
can
find_out
what
causes
all
the
congestion
and
suggest
methods
to
eliminate
it
.
Incidentally
,
14
th
Street
and
the
Expressway
is
the
high

intersection
during
