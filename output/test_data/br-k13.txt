In
the
dim
underwater
light
they
dressed
and
straightened
up
the
room
,
and
then
they
went
across
the
hall
to
the
kitchen
.
She
was
intimidated
by
the
stove
.
He
found
the
pilot_light
and
turned_on
one
of
the
burners
for
her
.
The
gas
flamed_up
two
inches
high
.
They
found
the
teakettle
and
put
water
on
to
boil
and
then
searched
through
the
icebox
.
Several
sections
of
a
loaf
of
dark_bread
;
butter
;
jam
;
a
tiny
cake
of
ice
.
In
their
search
for
what
turned_out
to
be
the
right
breakfast
china
but
the
wrong
table
silver
,
they
opened
every
cupboard
door
in
the
kitchen
and
pantry
.
While
she
was
settling
the
teacart
,
he
went_back
across
the
hall
to
their
bedroom
,
opened
one
of
the
suitcases
,
and
took_out
powdered
coffee
and
sugar
.
She
appeared
with
the
teacart
and
he
opened
the
windows
.
``
Do
you
want
to
call
Eugene
''
?
He
did
n't
,
but
it
was
not
really
a
question
,
and
so
he
left
the
room
,
walked
down
the
hall
to
the
front
of
the
apartment
,
hesitated
,
and
then
knocked
lightly
on
the
closed
door
of
the
study
.
A
sleepy
voice
answered
.
``
Le
petit_dejeuner
''
,
Harold
said
,
in
an
accent
that
did
credit
to
Miss_Sloan
,
his
high-school
French_teacher
.
At_the_same_time
,
his
voice
betrayed
uncertainty
about
their
being
here
,
and
conveyed
an
appeal
to
whatever
is
reasonable
,
peace-loving
,
and
dependable
in
everybody
.
Since
ordinary
breakfast-table
conversation
was
impossible
,
it
was
at_least
something
that
they
were
able
to
offer
Eugene
the
sugar_bowl
with
their
sugar
in
it
,
and
the
plate
of
bread_and_butter
,
and
that
Eugene
could
return
the
pitcher
of
hot
milk
to
them
handle
first
.
Eugene
put
a
spoonful
of
powdered
coffee
into
his
cup
and
then
filled
it
with
hot
water
.
Stirring
,
he
said
:
``
I
am
sorry
that
my
work
prevents
me
from
doing
anything
with
you
today
''
.
They
assured
him
that
they
did
not
expect
or
need
to
be
entertained
.
Harold
put
a
teaspoonful
of
powdered
coffee
in
his
cup
and
filled
it
with
hot
water
,
and
then
,
stirring
,
he
sat_back
in
his
chair
.
The
chair
creaked
.
Every
time
he
moved
or
said
something
,
the
chair
creaked
again
.
Eugene
was
not
entirely
silent
,
or
openly
rude
-
unless
asking
Harold
to
move
to
another
chair
and
placing
himself
in
the
fauteuil
that
creaked
so
alarmingly
was
an
act
of
rudeness
.
It
went
right
on
creaking
under
his
own
considerable
weight
,
and
all
it
needed
,
Harold
thought
,
was
for
somebody
to
fling
himself
back
in
a
fit
of
laughter
and
that
would
be
the
end
of_it
.
Through
the
open
window
they
heard
sounds
below
in
the
street
:
cartwheels
,
a
tired
horse
's
plodding
step
,
voices
.
Harold
indicated
the
photograph
on
the
wall
and
asked
what
church
the
stone
sculpture
was
in
.
Eugene
told
him
and
he
promptly
forgot
.
They
passed
the
marmalade
,
the
bread
,
the
black-market
butter
,
back_and_forth
.
Nothing
was
said
about
hotels
or
train
journeys
.
Eugene
offered
Harold
his
car
,
to
use
at
any
time
he
cared
to
,
and
when
this
offer
was
not
accepted
,
the
armchair
creaked
.
They
all
three
had
another
cup
of
coffee
.
Eugene
was
in
his
pajamas
and
dressing_gown
,
and
on
his
large
feet
he
wore
yellow
Turkish
slippers
that
turned_up
at
the
toes
.
``
Ex-cuse
me
''
,
he
said
in
Berlitz_English
,
and
got_up
and
left
them
,
to
bathe
and
dress
.
The
first
shrill
ring
of
the
telephone
brought
Harold
out
into
the
hall
.
He
realized
that
he
had
no
idea
where
the
telephone
was
.
At
that
moment
the
bathroom
door
flew_open
and
Eugene
came_out
,
with
his
face
lathered
for
shaving
,
and
strode
down
the
hall
,
tying
the
sash
of
his
dressing_gown
as
he
went
.
The
telephone
was
in
the
study
but
the
ringing
came
from
the
hall
.
Between
the
telephone
and
the
wall_plug
there
was
sixty
feet
of
cord
,
and
when
the
conversation
came
to
an
end
,
Eugene
carried
the
instrument
with
him
the
whole
length
of
the
apartment
,
to
his
bathroom
,
where
it
rang
three
more
times
while
he
was
shaving
and
in
the
tub
.
Before
he
left
the
apartment
he
knocked
on
their
door
and
asked
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
for
them
.
Harold
shook
his
head
.
``
Sabine
called
a_few
minutes
ago
''
,
Eugene
said
.
``
She
wants
you
and
Barbara
to
have
dinner
with
her
tomorrow
night
''
.
He
handed
Harold
a
key
to
the
front_door
,
and
cautioned
him
against
leaving
it
unlocked
while
they
were
out
of
the
apartment
.
When
enough
time
had
elapsed
so_that
there
was
little
likelihood
of
his
returning
for
something
he
had
forgotten
,
Harold
went_out
into
the
hall
and
stood
looking
into
one
room
after
another
.
In
the
room
next
to
theirs
was
a
huge
cradle
,
of
mahogany
,
ornately
carved
and
decorated
with
gold_leaf
.
It
was
the
most
important-looking
cradle
he
had
ever
seen
.
Then
came
their
bathroom
,
and
then
a
bedroom
that
,
judging
by
the
photographs
on
the
walls
,
must
belong_to
Mme_Cestre
.
A
young_woman
who
looked_like
Alix
,
with
her
two
children
.
Alix
and
Eugene
on
their
wedding_day
.
Matching
photographs
in
oval
frames
of
Mme_Bonenfant
and
an
elderly
man
who
must
be
Alix
's
grandfather
.
Mme_Vienot
,
considerably
younger
and
very
different
.
The
schoolboy
.
And
a
gray-haired
man
whose
glance
-
direct
,
lifelike
,
and
mildly
accusing
-
was
contradicted
by
the
gilt
and
black
frame
.
It
was
the
kind
of
frame
that
is
only
put
around
the
photograph
of
a
dead_person
.
Professor_Cestre
,
could
it
be
?
With
the
metal
shutters
closed
,
the
dining_room
was
so
dark
that
it
seemed
still
night
in
there
.
One
of
the
drawing-room
shutters
was
partly
open
and
he
made_out
the
shapes
of
chairs
and
sofas
,
which
seemed
to
be
upholstered
in
brown
or
russet
velvet
.
The
curtains
were
of
the
same
material
,
and
there
were
some
big
oil_paintings
-
portraits
in
the
style
of
Lancret
and
Boucher
.
Though
,
taken
individually
,
the
big
rooms
were
,
or
seemed
to
be
,
square
,
the
apartment
as
a
whole
formed
a
triangle
.
The
apex
,
the
study
where
Eugene
slept
,
was
light
and
bright
and
airy
and
cheerful
.
The
window
looked_out_on
the
Place_Redoute
-
it
was
the
only
window
of
the
apartment
that
did
.
Looking_around
slowly
,
he
saw
a
marble
fireplace
,
a
desk
,
a
low
bookcase
of
mahogany
with
criss-crossed
brass
wire
instead
of
glass
panes
in
the
doors
.
The
daybed
Eugene
had
slept
in
,
made_up
now
with
its
dark-brown
velours
cover
and
pillows
.
The
portable
record_player
with
a
pile
of
classical
records
beside
it
.
Beethoven
's
Fifth
was
the
one
on
top
.
Da-da-da-dum
.
Music
could
not
be
Eugene
's
passion
.
Besides
,
the
records
were
dusty
.
He
tried
the
doors
of
the
bookcase
.
Locked
.
The
titles
he
could
read
easily
through
the
criss-crossed
wires
:
works
on
theology
,
astral
physics
,
history
,
biology
,
political_science
.
No
poetry
.
No
novels
.
He
moved_over
to
the
desk
and
stood
looking
at
the
papers
on_it
but
not
touching
anything
.
The
clock
on
the
mantel_piece
was
scandalized
and
ticked
so
loudly
that
he
glanced
at
it
over
his
shoulder
and
then
quickly
left
the
room
.
The
concierge
called_out
to
them
as
they
were
passing_through
the
foyer
.
Her
quarters
were
on
the
right
as
you
walked
into
the
building
,
and
her
small
front_room
was
clogged
with
heavy
furniture
-
a
big
,
round
,
oak
dining_table
and
chairs
,
a
buffet
,
with
a
row
of
unclaimed
letters
inserted
between
the
mirror
and
its
frame
.
The
suitcases
had
come
while
they
were
out
,
and
had
been
put
in
their
room
,
the
concierge
said
.
He
waited
until
they
were
inside
the
elevator
and
then
said
:
``
Now
what
do
we
do
''
?
``
Call
the
Vouillemont
,
I
guess
''
.
``
I
guess
''
.
Rather_than
sit
around
waiting
for
the
suitcases
to
be
delivered
,
they
had
gone
sight-seeing
.
They
went
to
the
Flea_Market
,
expecting
to
find
the
treasures
of
Europe
,
and
found
instead
a
duplication
of
that
long
double
row
of
booths
in
Tours
.
Cheap
clothing
and
junk
of
every
sort
,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
.
They
looked
,
even_so
.
Looked
at
everything
.
Barbara
bought
some
cotton
aprons
,
and
Harold
bought
shoestrings
.
They
had
lunch
at
a
sidewalk
cafe
overlooking
the
intersection
of
two
broad
,
busy
,
unpicturesque
streets
,
and
coming
home
they
got
lost
in
the
Metro
;
it
took
them
over
an
hour
to
get_back
to
the
station
where
they
should
have
changed
,
in_order
to
take
the
line
that
went
to
the
Place_Redoute
.
It
was
the
end
of
the
afternoon
when
he
took
the
huge
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
inserted
it
into
the
keyhole
.
When
he
opened
the
door
,
there
stood
Eugene
,
on
his
way
out_of
the
apartment
.
He
was
wearing
sneakers
and
shorts
and
an
open-collared
shirt
,
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
little
black
bag
.
He
did
not
explain
where
he
was
going
,
and
they
did
not
ask
.
Instead
,
they
went_on
down
the
hall
to
their
room
.
``
Do
you
think
he
could
be
having
an
affair
''
?
Barbara
asked
,
as
they
heard
the
front_door
close
.
``
Oh_no
''
,
Harold
said
,
shocked
.
``
Well
,
this
is
France
,
after_all
''
.
``
I
know
,
but
there
must
be
some
other
explanation
.
He
's
probably
spending
the
evening
with
friends
''
.
``
And
for
that
he
needs
a
little
bag
''
?
They
went
shopping
in
the
neighborhood
,
and
bought
two
loaves_of_bread
with
the
ration
coupons
they
had
been
given
in
Blois
,
and
some
cheese
,
and
a
dozen
eggs
,
and
a
bag
of
oranges
from
a
peddler
in
the
Place_Redoute
-
the
first
oranges
they
had
seen
since
they
landed
.
They
had
Vermouth
,
sitting
in_front_of
a
cafe
.
When
they
got
home
Harold
was
grateful
for
the
stillness
in
the
apartment
,
and
thought
how
,
under
different
circumstances
,
they
might
have
stayed_on
here
,
in
these
old-fashioned
,
high-ceilinged
rooms
that
reminded
him
of
the
Irelands
'
apartment
in
the
East_Eighties
.
They
could
have
been
perfectly
happy
here
for
ten
whole
days
.
He
went
down
the
hall
to
Eugene
's
bathroom
,
to
turn_on
the
hot-water_heater
,
and
on
the
side
of
the
tub
he
saw
a
pair
of
blue
wool
swimming_trunks
.
He
felt
them
.
They
were
damp
.
He
reached_out
and
felt
the
bath_towel
hanging_on
the
towel_rack
over
the
tub
.
Damp
also
.
He
looked_around
the
room
and
then
called_out
:
``
Come
here
,
quick
''
?
``
What
is
it
''
?
Barbara
asked
,
standing
in
the
doorway
.
``
I
've
solved
the
mystery
of
the
little
bag
.
There
it
is
*
*
h
and
there
is
what
was
in
it
.
But
where
do
people
go
swimming
in
Paris
?
That
boat
in
the
river
,
maybe
''
.
``
What
boat
''
?
``
There
's
a
big
boat
anchored
near
the
Place_de_la_Concorde
,
with
a
swimming_pool
in
it
-
did
n't
you
notice
it
?
But
if
he
has
time
to
go
swimming
,
he
had
time
to
be
with
us
''
.
She
looked
at
him
in
surprise
.
``
I
know
''
,
he
said
,
reading
her
mind
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
I'm
going_to
do
with
you
''
.
``
It
's
because
we
are
in
France
''
,
he
said
,
``
and
know
so
few
people
.
So
something
like
this
matters
more_than
it
would
at
home
.
Also
,
he
was
so
nice
when
he
was
nice
''
.
``
All
because
I
did
n't
feel_like
dancing
''
.
``
I
do
n't
think
it
was
that
,
really
''
.
``
Then
what
was
it
''
?
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
wish
I
did
.
The
tweed
coat
,
maybe
.
The
thing
about
Eugene
is
that
he
's
very
proud
''
.
And
the
thing
about
hurt
feelings
,
the
wet
bathing_suit
pointed_out
,
is
that
the
person
who
has
them
is
not
quite
the
innocent
party
he
believes
himself
to
be
.
For_instance
-
what
about
all
those
people
Harold_Rhodes
went
toward
unhesitatingly
,
as
if
this
were
the
one
moment
they
would
ever
have
together
,
their
one
chance
of
knowing
each
other
?
Fortunately
,
the
embarrassing
questions
raised
by
objects
do
not
need
to
be
answered
,
or
we
would
all
have_to
go
sleep
in
the
open
fields
.
And
in_any_case
,
answers
may
clarify
but
they
do
not
change
anything
.
