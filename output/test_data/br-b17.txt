Sir
-
We
are
writing
in
reference_to
a
recent
``
suggestion
''
made
to
the
staff
of
the
Public_Health_Nursing_Service
of
Jersey_City
(
registered
professional
nurses
with
college
background
and
varying
experiences
)
.
The
day
before
Election_Day
,
to_which
we
are
entitled
as
a
legal_holiday
,
we
were
informed
to
report
to
our
respective
polls
to
work
as
``
workers
of
the
party
''
.
Being
ethical
and
professional
people
interested
in
community
health
and
well-being
,
we
felt
this
was
n't
a
function
of
our
position
.
Such
tactics
reek
of
totalitarianism
!
As
we
understand
,
this
directive
was
given
to
all
city
and
county
employes
.
To
our
knowledge
no
nurse
in
our
agency
has
been
employed
because
of
political
affiliation
.
We
,
therefore
,
considered
the
``
suggestion
''
an
insult
to
our
intelligence
,
ethics
,
Bill_of_Rights
,
etc.
.
Our
only
obligation
for
this
day
is
to
vote
,
free_of
persuasion
,
for
the
person
we
feel
is
capable
in
directing
the
public
.
This
is
our
duty
-
not
as
nurses
or
city
employes
-
but
as
citizens
of
the
United_States
.
Sir
-
I
read
of
a
man
who
felt
he
should
not
build
a
fallout
shelter
in
his
home
because
it
would
be
selfish
for
him
to
sit
secure
while
his
neighbors
had
no
shelters
.
Does
this
man
live
in
a
neighborhood
where
all
are
free
loaders
unwilling
to
help
themselves
,
but
ready_to
demand
that
``
the
community
''
help
and
protect
them
?
Community
shelters
are
,
of_course
,
necessary
for
those
having
no
space
for
shelter
.
If
in
a
town
of
2000
private
homes
,
half
of
them
have
shelters
,
the
need
for
the
community
shelters
will
be
reduced
to
that
extent
.
In
designing
his
home
fallout
shelter
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
a
man
from
planning
to
shelter
that
home
's
occupants
,
``
plus-one
''
-
so
he
will
be
able
to
take_in
a
stranger
.
I
hope
the
man
who
plans
to
sit
on
his
hands
until
the
emergency
comes
will
have
a
change
of
heart
,
will
get
busy
and
be
the
first
member
of
our
``
plus-one
''
shelter
club
.
Sir
-
People
continue
to
inquire
the
reason
for
the
race
for
outer_space
.
It
's
simple
enough
from
my
point_of_view
.
I
am
for
it
.
It
is
the
only
method
left
for
a
man
to
escape_from
a
woman
's
world
.
Sir
-
When
the_colonies
decided
upon
freedom
from
England
,
we
insisted
,
through
the
Declaration_of_Independence
,
that
the
nations
of
the
world
recognize
us
as
a
separate
political
entity
.
It
is
high_time
the
United_States
began
to
realize
that
the
God-given
rights
of
men
set_forth
in_that
document
are
applicable
today
to
Katanga
.
In
the
United_Nations
Charter
,
the
right
of
self-determination
is
also
an
essential
principle
.
This
,
again
,
applies
to
Katanga
.
The
people
of
Katanga
had
fought
for
,
and
obtained
,
their
freedom
from
the
Communist
yoke
of
Antoine_Gizenga
,
and
his
cohorts
.
By
political
,
economic
,
geographic
and
natural
standards
,
they
were
justified
in
doing
so
.
The
United_States
and
the
U._N.
denounce
their
own
principles
when
they
defend
the
Communist
oppressors
and
refuse
to
acknowledge
the
right
of
self-determination
of
the
Katangans
.
Sir
-
Permit
me
to
commend
your
editorial
in_which
you
stress
the
fact
that
a
program
of
county
colleges
will
substantially
increase
local
tax
burdens
and
that
taxpayers
have
a
right
to
a
clear
idea
of_what
such
a
program
would
commit
them
to
.
The
bill
which
passed
the
Assembly
last
May
and
is
now
pending
in
the
Senate
should
be
given
careful
scrutiny
.
The
procedure
for
determining
the
amounts_of_money
to
be
spent
by
county
colleges
and
raised
by
taxation
will
certainly
startle
many
taxpayers
.
Under
the
proposal
the
members
of
the
board_of_trustees
of
a
county
college
will
be
appointed
;
none
will
be
elected
.
The
trustees
will
prepare
an
annual
budget
for
the
college
and
submit
it
to
the
board
of
school
estimate
.
This
board
will
consist_of
two
of
the
trustees
of
the
college
,
and
the
director
and
two
members
of
the
board
of
freeholders
.
It
will
determine
the
amount_of_money
to
be
spent
by
the
college
and
will
certify
this
amount
to
the
board
of
freeholders
,
which
``
shall
appropriate
in
the
same
manner
as
other
appropriations
are
made
by
it
the
amount
so
certified
and
the
amount
shall
be
assessed
,
levied
and
collected
in
the
same
manner
as
moneys
appropriated
for
other
purposes
''
.
The
approval
of
only
three
members
of
the
board
of
school
estimate
is
required
to
certify
the
amount_of_money
to
be
allotted
to
the
college
.
Since
two
of
these
could
be
trustees
of
the
college
,
actually
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
the
consent
of
only
one
elected_official
to
impose
a
levy
of
millions
of
dollars
of
tax_revenue
.
This
is
taxation
without
representation
.
Sir
-
Your
editorial
,
``
Housing
Speedup
''
,
is
certainly
not
the
answer
to
our
slum
problems
.
The
very
rules
and
regulations
in
every
city
are
the
primary
case
of
slum
conditions
.
Change
our
taxing
law
so_that
no
tax
shall
be
charged
to
any
owner
for
additions
or
improvements
to
his
properties
.
Then
see
what
a
boom
in_all
trades
,
as_well
as
slum
clearance
at
no
cost
to
taxpayers
,
will
happen
.
Our
entire
economy
will
have
a
terrific
uplift
.
Sir

An
old_man
is
kicked
to
death
by
muggers
.
The
medical_examiner
states
that
death
was
due
to
``
natural
causes
''
.
I
once
heard
a
comedian
say
that
if
you
are
killed
by
a
taxicab
in
New_York
,
it
is
listed
as
``
death
due_to
natural
causes
''
.
Sir
-
Every
resident
of_this
city
should
visit
the
Newark_Museum
and
see
the
exhibit
``
Our
Changing
Skyline
in
Newark
''
.
It
will
be
at
the
museum
until
March
30
.
It
is
a
revelation
of_what
has
been
done
,
what
is
being
done
and
what
will
be
done
in
Newark
as
shown
by
architects
'
plans
,
models
and
pictures
.
It
shows
what
a
beautiful
city
Newark
will
become
and
certainly
make
every
Newarker
proud_of
this
city
.
It
should
also
make
him
desire
to
participate
actively
in
civic
,
school
and
religious
life
of
the
community
so_that
that
phase
of
Newark
will
live_up_to
the
challenge
presented
by
this
exhibit
.
Sir
-
I
hasten
to
join
in
praise
of
the
men
in
the
toll
booths
on
the
Garden_State
Parkway
.
Recently
I
traveled
the
parkway
from
East_Orange
to
Cape_May
and
I
found
the_most
courteous
group
of
men
you
will
find
anywhere
.
One
even
gave
my
little_dog
a
biscuit
.
It
was
very
refreshing
.
The
viewers
of
the
``
deep
Peep_Show
''
at
15
th
and
M
streets
nw.
have
an
added
attraction
-
the
view
of
a
fossilized
cypress
swamp
.
Twenty
feet
below
the
street
level
in
the
excavation
of
the
new
motel
to
be
constructed
on
this
site
,
a
black
coal-like
deposit
has
been
encountered
.
This
is
a
black
swamp
clay
in_which
about
one_hundred
million
years
ago
cypress-like
trees
were
growing
.
The
fossilized
remains
of
many_of
these
trees
are
found
embedded
in
the
clay
.
Some
of
the
stumps
are
as
much_as
three
feet
long
,
but
most_of
them
have
been
flattened
by
the
pressure
of
the
overlying
sediments
.
Although
the
wood
has
been
changed
to
coal
,
much
of_it
still
retains
its
original
cell
structure
.
In
the
clay
are
entombed
millions
of
pollen
grains
and
spores
which
came
from
plants
growing
in
the
region
at_the_time
.
These
microfossils
indicate
the
swamp
was
``
formed
during
the
Lower
Cretaceous_period
when
dinosaurs
were
at
their
heyday
and
when
the
first
flowering_plants
were
just
appearing
.
The
15
th
Street
deposit
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
nearby
famous
Mayflower_Hotel
cypress
swamp
on
17
th
Street
reported
in
The
Washington_Post
,
August
2
,
1955
,
which
was
probably
formed
during
the
second
interglacial
period
and
is
therefore
much
younger
.
Recently
the
secretary
of
the
Friends
Committee
on
National
Legislation
was
interviewed
on
the
air
.
While
I
respect
his
sincere
concern
for
peace
,
he
made
four
points
that
I
would
like
to
question
.
He
said
,
``
Let
's
work
for
peace
instead
of
protection
from
aggression
''
.
I
would
ask
,
``
Why
not
do
both
''
?
Military
power
does
not
cause
war
;
war
is
the
result
of
mistrust
and
lack
of
understanding
between
people
.
Are
we
not_late
,
especially
those
of
us
who
call
ourselves
Friends
,
in
doing
enough
about
this
lack
of
understanding
?
As
to
protection
,
the
speaker
disapproved
of
shelters
,
pointing_out
that
fallout
shelters
would
not
save
everyone
.
Is
this
a
reason
for
saving
no
one
?
Would
the
man
with
an
empty
life
boat
row
away
from
a
shipwreck
because
his
boat
could
not
pick_up
everyone
?
The
speaker
suggested
that
the
desolation
of
a
post-attack
world
would
be
too
awful
to
face
.
If
the
world
comes
to
this
,
would
n't
it
be
the
very
time
when
courage
and
American
know-how
would
be
needed
to
help
survivors
rebuild
?
Many_of
our
young
people
think
it
would
.
Lastly
,
the
speaker
decried
our
organized
program
of
emergency
help
calling
it
``
Civilian_Defense
''
.
In
1950
,
Public_Law
920
created
Civil_Defense
(
different
from
Civilian-groups
of
World_War
2
,
)
,
a
responsibility
of
the
Government
at_all
levels
to
help
reduce
loss
of
life
and
property
in
disaster
,
natural
or
manmade
.
Far
from
creating
fear
,
as
the
speaker
suggests
,
preparedness
-
knowing
what
to
do
in
an
emergency
-
gives
people
confidence
.
Civil_Defense
has
far
to
go
and
many
problems
to
solve
,
but
is
it
not
in
the
best
spirit
of
our
pioneer
tradition
to
be
not_only
willing
,
but
prepared
to
care
for
our
own
families
and
help
our
neighbors
in
any
disaster
-
storm
,
flood
,
accident
or
even
war
?
It
seems
rather
peculiar
that
residents
of
apartments
are
denied
the
right
of
providing
themselves
with
the
protection
and
companionship
of
dogs
.
I
feel
that
few
burglars
would
be
prone
to
break
and
enter
into
someone
's
apartment
if
they
were
met
with
a
good
hardy
growl
that
a
dog
would
provide
.
In_addition
,
would
not
the
young
female
public
of
Washington
be
afforded
a
greater
degree
of
protection
at
night
when
they
are
on
the
streets
if
they
were
accompanied
by
a
dog
on
a
leash
?
I
grant
that
the
dog
may
not
be
really
protective
,
based
on
his
training
,
but
if
you
were
roaming
the
streets
looking_for
a
purse
to
snatch
or
a
young_lady
to
molest
,
how
quick
would
you
be
to
attack
a
person
strolling
with
a
dog
?
I
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
landlords
and
Commissioners
get
together
and
consider
liberalizing
the
practice
of
prohibiting
dogs
in
apartments
.
Use
the
terraces
of
the
Capitol
for
a
sidewalk
cafe
?
Could
Senator_Humphrey
be
serious
in
his
proposal
?
Is
nothing
in_this
country
more
sacred
than
the
tourists
'
comfort
?
Perhaps
the
idea
of
sidewalk
cafes
could
be
extended
.
The
Lincoln
and
Jefferson_Memorials
are
rather
bleak
.
Why
not
put
a
cafe
in
each
so
the
tourists
would
not
have
to
travel
too
far
to
eat
?
Unfortunately
the
cafes
might
not
make
enough
money
to
support
themselves
during
the
off
season
.
As
an
added
suggestion
to
balance
the
budget
,
the
Government
could
sell
advertising
space
on
the
Washington_Monument
.
It
is
visible
throughout
the
city
,
and
men
from
Madison_ave.
would
jump
at
the
chance
.
Sen._Hubert_Humphrey
is
obviously
a
man
with
a
soul
and
heart
.
He
,
like
most_of
us
,
wants
to
be
able
to
sit
,
to
contemplate
and
be
moved
by
the
great
outdoors
.
Let
us
have
more
benches
and
fewer
forbidden
areas
around
fountains
and
gardens
.
Let
us
,
like
the_French
,
have
outdoor
cafes
where
we
may
relax
,
converse
at_leisure
and
enjoy
the
passing
crowd
.
Two
strong
dissents
from
the
majority
report
of
the
Joint_Economic_Committee
(
May
2
)
by
Senators
Proxmire
and
Butler
allege
that
the
New_Deal
fiscal
policy
of
the
Thirties
did
not
work
.
