Everywhere
I
went
in
Formosa
I
asked
the
same
question
.
I
was
searching
for
an
accent
of
self-delusion
or
,
even
,
of
hypocrisy
.
I
never
found
it
among
any
of
the
Chinese
with
whom
I
spoke
,
though
granted
they
were
,
almost
all
,
members
of
the
official
family
who
,
presumably
,
harbor
official
thoughts
.
But
I
questioned
,
also
,
professional
soldiers
,
who
would
not
easily
be
hypnotized
by
a
septuagenarian
's
dreamy
irredentism
.
Their
answer
was
:
it
can
be
done
,
and
we
will
do
it
.
And_then
I
put
the
question
as
pointedly
as
I
could
directly
to
Chiang_Kai-shek
:
``
In
America
''
,
I
said
,
``
practically
no
one
believes
that
you
subjectively
intend
to
re-enter
the
Mainland
.
What
evidence
is
there
of
an
objective
kind
that
in_fact
your
government
proposes
to
do
just
that
,
and
that
it
can
be
done
''
?
He
smiled
.
(
He
always
smiles
-
at_least
at
visitors
,
I
gather
.
He
smiled
also
at
a
British
bloke
seated
next
to
me
,
who
asked
the_most
asinine
questions
.
I
recalled
sympathetically
the
Duke
's
complaint
in
Browning
's
``
My
Last
Duchess
''
.
He
smiled
,
and
said
a
word
or
two
to
the
interpreter
,
who
turned_to
me
,
``
The
President
wonders
where
you
are
going
after
you
leave
Taipei
''
?
That
,
I
smarted
,
is
a
royal
rebuff
if
ever
there
was
one
.
I
answered
the
routine
question
about
my
itinerary
,
rather
coolly
.
Chiang
spoke
again
,
this
time
at
greater
length
.
``
The
President
says
''
,
the
translator
came_in
,
``
that
the
reason
he
asked
you
where
you
were
going
is
because
he
hoped
you
would
be
visiting
other
areas
in
Southeast_Asia
,
and
that
everywhere
you
went
,
you
would
seek
the
answer
to
your
question
.
He
says
that
if
he
were
to
express
to
you
,
once_again
,
his
own
profound
determination
to
go
to
the
Mainland
,
and
his
faith
that
that
return
is
feasible
,
he
would
merely
sound
redundant
.
So
you
yourself
must
seek
these
objective
data
,
and
come
to
your
own
conclusions
.
Any
information
we
have
here
in
Taiwan
is
at
your
disposal
''
.
Fair
enough
.
What
are
the
relevant
data
?
For
every
person
on
Taiwan
,
there
are
sixty
in
Mainland_China
.
If
the
raw
population
figures
are
crucially
relevant
,
then
it
is
idle
to
think_of
liberation
,
as
idle
as
to
suppose
that
Poland
might
liberate
Russia
.
Relative
military
manpower
?
Less_than
60
-
1
,
but
at_least
6
-
1
.
The
estimates
vary
widely
on
the
strength
of
the
Chinese
army
.
Say
four
million
.
The
armed_forces
of
Taiwan
are
at
a
working
strength
of
about
450000
,
though
a
reserve
potential
twice
that
high
is
contemplated
.
Skill
?
Training
?
Morale
?
It
is
generally
conceded
that
the
Formosan
air_force
is
the
best
by_far
in
Asia
,
and
the
army
the
best
trained
.
The
morale
is
very
high
.
Even_so
,
it
adds_up
to
impossible
odds
,
except
that
the
question
arises
,
On
whose
side
would
the
Mainland
Chinese
army
fight
?
The
miserable
people
of
China
,
the
largest
cast
ever
conscripted
to
enact
an
ideological
passion_play
,
cannot
themselves
resist
overtly
.
They
think
,
perforce
,
of
physical
survival
:
everything
else
is
secondary
.
But
the
army
which
Mao
continues
to
feed
well
,
where
are
its
sympathies
?
The
psychological
strategists
in
Taiwan
stress
the
great
sense
of
family
,
cultivated
in
China
over
thousands
of
years
.
It
has
not
been
extirpated
by
ten
years
of
Communist
depersonalization
.
Every
soldier
in
the
army
has
,
somewhere
,
relatives
who
are
close_to
starvation
.
The
soldiers
themselves
cannot
stage
a
successful
rebellion
,
it
is
assumed
:
but
will
their
discontent
spread
to
the
officer
class
?
The
immediate
families
of
the
generals
and
the
admirals
are
well_fed
:
a
despot
does
not
economize
on
his
generals
.
But
there
are
the
cousins
and
aunts
and
nephews
.
Their
privations
are
almost
beyond
endurance
.
In
behalf
of_what
?
Leninism-Marxism
,
as
understood
by
Exegete_Mao
.
To
whom
will
the
generals
stay
loyal
?
There
is
little
doubt
if
they
had
a
secret
ballot
,
they
would
vote
for
food
for
their
family
,
in_place
of
ideological
purity
out
on
the
farm
.
It
is
another
question
whether
``
they
''
-
or
a
single
general
,
off
in
a
corner
of
China
,
secure
for
a_few
(
galvanizing
?
)
days
at_least
from
instant
retaliation
-
will
defy
the
Party
.
But
the
disposition
to
rebel
is
most
definitely
there
.
But
there
must
be
a
catalytic
pressure
.
The
military
in
Taiwan
believe
that
the
Communists
have
made
two
mistakes
,
which
,
together
,
may
prove
fatal
.
The
first
was
the
commune
program
,
which
will
ensure
agricultural
poverty
for
years
.
The
family
is
largely
broken_up
;
and
where
it
is
not
,
it
is
left
with
no
residue
,
and
the
social
meaning
of_this
is
enormous
.
For
it
is
the
family
that
,
in
China
,
has
always
provided
social_security
for
the
indigent
,
the
sick
,
the
down-and-out
members
of
the
clan
.
Now
the
government
must
do
that
;
but
the
government
is
left
with
no
reserve
granary
,
under
the
agricultural
system
it
has
ordained
.
Thus
the
government
simultaneously
undertook
the
vast
burden
of
social_security
which
had
traditionally
been
privately
discharged
,
and
created
a
national
scarcity
which
has
engendered
calamitous
problems
of
social_security
.
The
second
mistake
is
Tibet
.
Tibet
has
historically
served
China
as
a
buffer_state
.
A
friendly
state
,
sometimes
only
semi-independent
,
but
never
hostile
.
China
never
tried
to
integrate
Tibet
by
extirpating
the
people
's
religion
and
institutions
.
Red_China
is
trying
to
do
this
,
and
she
is
not
likely
ever
to
succeed
.
Tibet
is
too
vast
,
the
terrain
is
too
difficult
.
Tibet
may
bleed
China
as
Algeria
is
bleeding
France
.
These
continuing
pressures
,
social
,
economic
and
military
,
are
doing
much
to
keep
China
in
a
heightening
state
of
tension
.
The
imposition
of
yet
another
pressure
,
a
strong
one
,
from_the_outside
,
might
cause
it
to
snap
.
The
planners
in
Taiwan
struck
me
as
realistic
men
.
They
know
that
they
must
depend
heavily
on
factors
outside
their
own
control
.
First_and_foremost
,
they
depend_on
the
inhuman
idiocies
of
the
Communist
regime
.
On
these
they
feel
they
can
rely
.
Secondly
,
they
depend_on
America
's
``
moral
cooperation
''
when
the
crucial
moment
arrives
.
They
hope
that
if
history
vouchsafes
the
West
another
Budapest
,
we
will
receive
the
opportunity
gladly
.
I
remarked
jocularly
to
the
President
that
the
future
of
China
would
be
far
more
certain
if
he
would
invite
a
planeload
of
selected
American
Liberals
to
Quemoy
on
an
odd
day
.
He
affected
(
most
properly
)
not
to
understand
my
point
.
But
he
-
and
all_of
China
-
wear
the
scars
of
American
indecisiveness
,
and
he
knows
what
an
uncertain
ally
we
are
.
We
have
been
grand
to
Formosa
itself
-
lots_of
aid
,
and
,
most_of
the
time
,
a
policy
of
support
for
the
offshore
islands
.
But
our
outlook
has
been
,
and
continues
to
be
,
defensive
.
A
great_deal
depends_on
the
crystallization
of
Mr._Kennedy
's
views
on
the
world
struggle
.
The
Free
Chinese
know
that
the
situation
on
the
Mainland
is
in
flux
,
and
are
poised
to
strike
.
There
is
not_anywhere
on
the
frontiers
of
freedom
a
more
highly
mobilized
force
for
liberation
.
The
moment
of
truth
is
the
moment
of
crisis
.
During
the
slow
buildup
,
the
essence
of
a
policy
or
a
man
is
concealed
under
embroidered
details
,
fine
words
,
strutting
gestures
.
The
crisis
burns
these
suddenly
away
.
There
the
truth
is
,
open_to
eyes
that
are
willing
to
look
.
The
moment
passes
.
New
self-deceiving
rags
are
hurriedly
tossed
on
the
too-naked
bones
.
A
truth-revealing
crisis
erupted
in
Katanga
for
a_couple_of
days
this
month
,
to
be
quickly
smothered
by
the
high_pressure
verbal
fog
that_is
kept
on_tap
for
such
emergencies
.
Before
memory
,
too
,
clouds_over
,
let
us
make
a
note
or
two
of_what
could
be
seen
.
The
measure
was
instantly
taken
,
as
always
in
such
cases
,
of
public
men
at
many
levels
.
One
knows
better
,
now
,
who
has
bone
and
who
has
jelly
in
his
spine
.
But
I
am
here
concerned
more
with
policy
than
with
men
.
Public
men
come
and
go
but
great
issues
of
policy
remain
.
Now
,
everyone
knows
-
or
knew
in
the
week
of
December
10
-
that
something
had
gone
shockingly
wrong
with
American
foreign_policy
.
The
United_States
was
engaged
in
a
military
attack
on
a
peaceful
,
orderly
people
governed
by
a
regime
that
had
proved
itself
the_most
pro-Western
and
anti-Communist
within
any
of
the
new
nations
-
the
only
place
in
Africa
,
moreover
,
where
a
productive
relationship
between
whites
and
blacks
had
apparently
been
achieved
.
Of_course
the
fighting
was
officially
under
the
auspices
of
the
United_Nations
.
But
in
the
moment
of
truth
everyone
could
see
that
the
U._S.
was
in_reality
the
principal
.
The
moment
simultaneously
revealed
that
in
the
crisis
our
policy
ran
counter
to_that
of
all
our
NATO
allies
,
to
the
entire
Western
community
.
By
our
policy
the
West
was
-
is
-
split
.
But
the
key
revelation
is
not
new
.
The
controlling
pattern
was
first
displayed
in
the
Hungary-Suez
crisis
of
November
1956
.
It
reappears
,
in
whole
or
part
,
whenever
a
new
crisis
exposes
the
reality
:
in
Cuba
last
spring
(
with
which
the
Dominican
events
of
last
month
should
be
paired
)
;
at
the
peaks
of
the
nuclear
test
and
the
Berlin
cycles
;
in_relation_to
Laos
,
Algeria
,
South_Africa
;
right_now
,
with
almost
cartoon
emphasis
,
in
the
temporally
linked
complex
of
Tshombe-Gizenga-Goa-Ghana
.
This
prime
element
of
the
truth
may
be
stated
as_follows
:
Under
prevailing
policy
,
the
U._S.
can
take
the
initiative
against
the
Right
,
but
cannot
take
the
initiative
against
the
Left
.
It
makes
no
difference
what
part
of
the
world
is
involved
,
what
form
of
regime
,
what
particular
issue
.
The
U._S.
cannot
take
the
initiative
against
the
Left
.
There
is
even
some
question
whether
the
U._S.
can
any
longer
defend
itself
against
an
initiative
by
the
Left
.
We
can
attack
Tshombe
,
but
not
Gigenza
.
No_matter
that
Gizenga
is
Moscow
's
man
in
the
Congo
.
No_matter
that
it
is
his
troops
who
rape
Western
women
and
eat
Western
men
.
No_matter
that
the
Katanga
operation
is
strategically
insane
in_terms_of
Western
interests
in
Africa
.
(
Even
granted
that
the
Congo
should
be
unified
,
you
do
n't
protect
Western
security
by
first
removing
the
pro-Western
weight
from
the
power
equilibrium
.
)
We
can
force
Britain
and
France
out
of
the
Suez
,
but
we
cannot
so_much
as
try
to
force
the
Russian
tanks
back
from
Budapest
.
We
can
mass
our
fleet
against
the
Trujillos
,
but
not
against
the
Castros
.
We
can
vote_in
the
UN
against
South_African
apartheid
or
Portuguese
rule
in
Angola
,
but
we
cannot
even
introduce
a
motion
on
the
Berlin_Wall
-
much
less
,
give
the
simple
order
to
push
the
Wall
down
.
We
officially
receive
the
anti-French
,
Moscow-allied
Algerian
FLN
,
but
we
denounce
the
pro-Europe
,
anti-Communist
OAS
as
criminal
.
In
the
very
week
of
our
war
against
Katanga
,
we
make
a
$
133
million
grant
to
Kwame_Nkrumah
,
who
has
just
declared
his
solidarity
with
the
Communist
bloc
,
and
is
busily
turning
his
own
country
into
a
totalitarian
dictatorship
.
As
our
planes
land
the
war
materiel
that
kills
pro-Western
Katangans
,
we
stand
supinely
bleating
while
Nehru
's
troops
smash
into
a
five-hundred-year-old
district
of
our
NATO
ally
,
Portugal
.
What
explains
this
uni-directional
paralysis
?
It
is
the
consequence
of
the
system
of
ideas
that
constitutes
the
frame
of
our
international
-
and
in
some
degree
our
domestic
-
policy
.
The
Suez-Hungary
crisis
proves
that
this
system
was
not
invented
by
the
new
Administration
,
but
only
made
more
consistent
and
more
active
.
Most
immediately
relevant
to
these
episodes
in
Goa
,
Katanga
and
Ghana
,
as
to
the
Suez-Hungary
crisis
before
them
,
is
the
belief
that
the
main
theater
of
the
world
drama
is
the
underdeveloped
region
of
Asia
,
Africa
and
Latin_America
.
From
this
belief
is
derived
the
practical
orientation
of
our
policy
on
the
``
uncommitted
''
(
``
neutralist
''
,
``
contested
''
)
nations
,
especially
on
those
whose
leaders
make
the_most
noise
-
Nehru
,
Tito
,
Nkrumah
,
Sukarno
,
Betancourt
,
etc.
.
Our
chief
aim
becomes
that
of
finding
favor
in
neutralist
eyes
.
If
we
grasp
this
orientation
as
a
key
,
our
national
conduct
in_all
of
the
events
here
mentioned
becomes
intelligible
.
And
it
becomes
clear
why
in_general
we
cannot
take
the
initiative
against
the
Left
.
