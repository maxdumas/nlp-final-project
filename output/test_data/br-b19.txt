I
just
wish
to
congratulate
Inspector_Trimmer
and
his
efficient
police
troops
in
cleaning
the
city
of
those
horrible
automobiles
.
We
have
now
a
quiet
city
,
fewer
automobiles
,
less
congestion
,
and
fewer
retail
customers
shopping
in
center
city
.
Good
for
Mr._Trimmer
.
Maybe
he
will
help
to
turn
our
fair
city
into
a
``
ghost
''
town
.
I
worked_on
the
Schuylkill_Expressway
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
big
trucks
carrying
rock
and
concrete
there
would
n't
be
an
Expressway
.
Without
these
massive
trucks
highways
would
still
be
just
an
idea
of
the
future
.
Mr._George_Hough
(
Oct.
30
)
sounds
like
a
business
man
who
waits
until
the
last
minute
to
leave
his
home
or
shop
.
The
trucks
today
help
pay
for
this
highway
.
They
try
to
keep
within
the
speed_limits
.
Although
today
's
trucks
are
as
fast
as
passenger_cars
,
a
truck_driver
has
to
be
a
sensible
person
and
guard
against
hogging
the
road
.
The
letter_writer
who
suggested
saving
money
by
taking
kids
out
of
school
at
14
should
have
signed
his
letter
``
Simpleton
''
instead
of
``
Simplicitude
''
.
Such
kids
only
wind_up
among
the
unemployed
on
relief
or
in
jail
where
they
become
a
much
bigger
burden
.
There
are
lots_of
jobs
available
for
trained
high_school
graduates
,
but
not
for
the
dropouts
.
What
we
need
is
more
vocational
training
in
high_schools
,
not
more
dropouts
.
I
suppose
I
am
missing
some
elementary
point
but
I
honestly
cannot
see
how
two
wrongs
can
make
a
right
!
I
am
referring
to
this
country
conducting
atmosphere
tests
of
nuclear
bombs
just
because
Russia
is
.
Will
our
bombs
be
cleaner
or
will
their
fallout
be
less
harmful
to
future
generations
of
children
?
If
an
atom_bomb
in
1945
could
destroy
an
entire
city
surely
the
atomic
arsenal
we
now
have
is
more_than
adequate_to
fulfill
any
military
objective
required
of_it
.
As
I
see
it
,
if
war
starts
and
we
survive
the
initial
attack
enough
to
be
able
to
fight_back
,
the
nuclear_weapons
we
now
have
-
at_least
the
bombs
-
can
inflict
all
the
demage
that
is
necessary
.
Why
do
we
need
bigger
and
better
bombs
?
I
repeat
,
two
wrongs
do
not
make
a
right
.
Everyone
should
take
time
to
read
Martin_Luther
's
Hymn
``
A
Mighty_Fortress
Is
Our
God
''
.
Especially
the
first_half
of
the
third
verse
.
To
our
everlasting
shame
,
we
led
the
world
in_this
nuclear
arms_race
sixteen
years
ago
when
we
dropped
the
first
bombs
on
Hiroshima
and
Nagasaki
.
Having
led
the
world
in_this
mad
race
I
pray
that
we
may
have
the
wisdom
and
courage
to
lead
it
out
of
the
race
.
Are
we
to
be
the
master
of
the
atom
,
or
will
the
atom
be
our
master
-
and
destroy
us
!
Just
because
Cheddi_Jagan
,
new
boss
of
British_Guiana
,
was
educated
in
the
United_States
is
no
reason
to
think
he
is
n't
a
Red
.
We
have
quite_a_few
home-grown
specimens
of
our
own
.
If
we
go_all_gooey
over
this
newest
Castro
(
until
he
proves
he
is
n't
)
we
've
got
rocks
in
our
heads
.
How
many_times
must
we
get
burned
before
we
learn
?
Just
to
remind
the
Communists
that
the
bombs
dropped
on
Japan
were
to
end
a
war
not
start
one
.
The
war
could
have
continued
many
years
with
many
thousands
killed
on
both
sides
.
Intelligent
people
will
admit
that
bombs
and
rockets
of
destruction
are
frightening
whether
they
fall
on
Japan
,
London
or
Pearl_Harbor
.
That
is
why
the
United_Nations
was
formed
so_that
intelligent
men
with
good
intentions
from
all
countries
could
meet
and
solve
problems
without
resorting
to
war
.
Russia
has
showed
its
intentions
by
exploding
bombs
in
peace
time
to
try
to
frighten
the
world
.
Why
are
n't
the
Soviets
expelled
from
the
U._N.
?
While
``
better
late
than
never
''
may
have
certain
merits
,
the
posthumous
award
of
the
Nobel_Prize
for
Peace
to
the
late
Dag_Hammarskjold
strikes
me
as
less_than
a
satisfactory
expression
of
appreciation
.
Had
it
been
bestowed
while
the
Secretary_General
of
the
United_Nations
was
living
,
unquestionably
he
would
have
been
greatly
encouraged
in
pursuing
a
difficult
and
,
in
many
ways
,
thankless
task
.
According
to
one
report
,
however
,
Mr._Hammarskjold
was
considered
``
too
controversial
''
a
figure
to
warrant
bestowal
of
the
coveted
honor
last
spring
.
Actually
,
of_course
,
that
label
``
controversial
''
applied
only
because
he
was
carrying_out
the
mandate
given
him
by
the
world_organization
he
headed
rather_than
following
the
dictates
of
the
Soviet_Union
.
At
Khrushchev
's
door
,
therefore
,
can
be
placed
the
primary
blame
but
also
at_fault
are
those
who
permitted
themselves
to
be
intimidated
.
It
is
well
for
us
to
remember
that
a
wreath
on
a
coffin
never
can
atone
for
flowers
withheld
while
they
still
can
be
enjoyed
.
As
has
happened
so
often
in_the_past
,
the
ability
to
recognize
true
greatness
has
been
inadequate
and
tardy
.
Just
a
brief
note
of
appreciation
to
Vice_President
Johnson
and
Pakistani
camel
driver
Bashir_Ahmad
for
providing
a
first-class
example
of
``
people
to
people
''
good_will
.
If
only
this
could
be
done
more_often
-
with
such
heartening
results
-
many_of
the
earth
's
``
big
problems
''
would
shrink
to
the
insignificances
they
really
are
.
P._S.
.
Thanks
for
your
good
coverage
of
Ahmad
's
visit
,
too
!
Your
continuing
editorials
concerning
the
Schuylkill_Expressway
are
valuable
;
however
,
several
pertinent
considerations
deserve
recognition
.
One
of
the
problems
associated
with
the
expressway
stems
from
the
basic
idea
.
We
shuffle
a
large
percentage
of
the
cars
across
the
river
twice
.
They
start
on
the
East_side
of
the
Schuylkill
,
have
to
cross
over
to
the
West
to
use
the
expressway
and
cross
over_again
to
the
East
at
their
destination
.
Bridges
,
tunnels
and
ferries
are
the_most
common
methods
of
river
crossings
.
Each
one
of
these
is
,
by
its
nature
,
a
focal_point
or
a
point
of
natural
congestion
.
We
should
avoid
these
congestion
points
or
,
putting
it
another
way
,
keep
ars
starting
and
ending
on
the
East_side
of
the
river
-
on
the
East_side
.
This
can
be
accomplished
by
several
logical
steps
:
Widen
the
East_River
Drive
at
least
one
lane
.
So
widen
it
as
to
minimize
the
present
curves
and
eliminate
drainage
problems
.
Paint
continuous
lane
stripes
and
install
overhead
directional
lights
as
on
our
bridges
.
One
additional
lane
would
then
be
directional
with
the
traffic
burden
and
effectively
increase
the
traffic
carrying_capability
of
the
East_River_Drive
by
fifty_percent
.
This
could
be
accomplished
without
the
tremendous
expenditures
necessitated
by
the
Schuylkill_Expressway
and
without
destroying
the
natural
beauty
of
the
East_River_Drive
.
I
wish
to
advocate
two
drastic
changes
in
Washington_Square
:
Take_away
George_Washington
's
statue
.
Replace
it
with
the
statue
of
one
or
another
of
the
world
's
famous
dictators
.
There
's
no
sense
in
being
reminded
of
times
that
were
.
Washington_Square
seems
not
part
of
a
free
land
.
It
may
remind
one
of
Russia
,
China
or
East_Berlin
;
but
it
can
n't
remind
one
of
the
freedom
that
Washington
and
the
Continental
soldiers
fought
for
.
The
Fairmount_Park_Commission
will
no_doubt
approve
my
two
proposals
,
because
it
is
responsible_for
the
change
of
ideological
atmosphere
in
the
Square
.
The_matter
may
seem
a
small
thing
to
some
people
,
I
know
,
but
it
's
a
very
good
start
on_the_road
to
Totalitarianism
.
The
Commission
has
posted
signs
in
Washington_Square
saying
:
The
Feeding
of
Birds
is
Prohibited
in_This
Square
.
Fairmount_Park_Commission
Does
each
tentacle
of
the
octopus
of
City_Government
reach_out
and
lash
at
whatever
it
dislikes
or
considers
an
annoyance
?
If
birds
do
n't
belong
in
a
Square
or
Park
,
what
does
?
They
are
the_most
beautiful
part
of_that
little
piece
of
Nature
.
The
trees
are
their
homes
;
but
the
Commission
does
not
share
such
sentiments
.
The
whole
official
City
apparently
has
an
intense
hatred
toward
birds
.
Starlings
and
blackbirds
are
scared_off
by
cannon
,
from
City_Hall
.
Just
a
preliminary
measure
.
If
any
are
left
,
presently
,
we
may
expect
to
see
signs
specifically
prohibiting
the
feeding
of
them
too
.
The
City_Government
is
not
united
in
an
all-out
,
to-the-death
drive
to
stamp_out
gangs
,
delinquents
,
thugs
,
murderers
,
rapists
,
subversives
.
Indeed
no
.
Let
every
policeman
and
park
guard
keep
his
eye
on
John
and
Jane_Doe
,
lest
one
piece
of
bread
be
placed
undetected
and
one
bird
survive
.
Of_course
,
in_this
small
way
of
forcing
the
people
to
watch
as
tiny
and
innocent
and
dependent
creatures
die
because
we
're
afraid
to
feed
them
and
afraid
to
protest
and
say
``
How_come
?
What
's
your
motive
?
Who
wants
this
deed
done
''
?
-
in_this
small
way
do
the
leaders
of
a
city
,
or
of
a
nation
,
inure
the
masses
to
watching
,
or
even
inflicting
,
torture
and
death
,
upon
even
their
fellow
men
.
One
means
to
help
the_birds
occurs
to
me
:
Let
the
chimes
that
ring
over
Washington_Square
twice
daily
,
discontinue
any
piece_of_music
but
one
.
Let
them
offer
on
behalf
of
those
creatures
whose
melody
has
been
the
joy
of
mankind
since
time
began
,
the
hymn
``
Abide
With
Me
''
.
We
will
know
,
and
He
will
know
,
to
whom
it
is
rendered
,
what
the_birds
would
ask
.
There
is
a
trend
today
to
bemoan
the
fact
that
Americans
are
too
``
soft
''
.
Unfortunately
,
those
who
would
remedy
our
``
softness
''
seek
to
do
so
with
calisthenics
.
They
are
working_on
the
wrong
part
of
our
anatomy
.
It
is
not
our
bodies
but
our
hearts
and
heads
that
have
grown
too
soft
.
Ashamed
of
our
wealth
and
power
,
afraid_of
so-called
world
opinion
and
addicted
to
peace
,
we
have
allowed
our
soft-heartedness
to
lead
to
soft-headed
policies
.
When
we
become
firm
enough
to
stand
for
those
ideals
which
we
know
to
be
right
,
when
we
become
hard
enough
to
refuse
to
aid
nations
which
do
not
permit
self-determination
,
when
we
become
strong
enough
to
resist
any_more
drifts
towards
socialism
in
our
own
Nation
,
when
we
recognize
that
our
enemy
is
Communism
not
war
,
and
when
we
realize
that
concessions
to
Communists
do
not
insure
peace
or
freedom
,
then
,
and
only
then
will
we
no_longer
be
``
soft
''
.
America
does
n't
need
to
``
push-up
''
,
she
needs
to
stand_up
!
The
new
column
by
Maurice_Stans
regarding
business
scandals
,
is
fair
and
accurate
in
most
respects
and
his
solution
to
the
problem
has
some
merit
.
However
,
he
states
unequivocally
``
the
scandals
in
business
are
far
less
significant
than
the
scandals
in_labor
''
.
I
must
,
in
fairness
,
take_issue
with
his
premise
,
primarily
because
the
so-called
scandals
in_labor
unions
were
very_much
connected
with
business
scandals
.
The
area
most
prominently
commented
on
during
the
McClellan
hearings
had
to
do
with
``
sweetheart
contracts
''
.
These
arrangements
would
have
been
impossible
if
the
business_community
was
truly
interested
in
the
welfare
of
its
employes
.
A
sweetheart
arrangement
can
come_about
as
often
by
employers
doing
the
corrupting
as
by
unscrupulous
labor_leaders
demanding
tribute
.
Anyone
familiar_with
the
details
of
the
McClellan
hearings
must
at_once
realize
that
the
sweetheart
arrangements
augmented
employer
profits
far
more_than
they
augmented
the
earnings
of
the
corruptible
labor_leaders
.
Further
,
it
should
be
recalled
that
some
very
definite
steps
were
taken
by
Congress
to
combat
corruption
in
the
labor_movement
by
its
passage
of
the
Landrum-Griffin_Act
.
