Vincent_G._Ierulli
has
been
appointed
temporary
assistant
district_attorney
,
it
was
announced
Monday
by
Charles_E._Raymond
,
District_Attorney
.
Ierulli
will
replace
Desmond_D._Connall
who
has
been
called
to
active
military_service
but
is
expected
back
on_the_job
by
March
31
.
Ierulli
,
29
,
has
been
practicing
in
Portland
since
November
,
1959
.
He
is
a
graduate
of
Portland_University
and
the
Northwestern_College
of
Law
.
He
is
married
and
the
father
of
three
children
.
Helping
foreign
countries
to
build
a
sound
political
structure
is
more
important
than
aiding
them
economically
,
E._M._Martin
,
assistant
secretary_of_state
for
economic
affairs
told
members
of
the
World_Affairs_Council_Monday
night
.
Martin
,
who
has
been
in
office
in
Washington
,
D._C.
,
for
13
months
spoke
at
the
council
's
annual
meeting
at
the
Multnomah_Hotel
.
He
told
some
350
persons
that
the
United_States
'
challenge
was
to
help
countries
build
their
own
societies
their
own
ways
,
following
their
own
paths
.
``
We
must
persuade
them
to
enjoy
a
way_of_life
which
,
if_not
identical
,
is
congenial
with
ours
''
,
he
said
but
adding
that
if
they
do
not
develop
the
kind_of
society
they
themselves
want
it
will
lack
ritiuality
and
loyalty
.
Insuring
that
the
countries
have
a
freedom
of
choice
,
he
said
,
was
the
biggest
detriment
to
the
Soviet_Union
.
He
cited
East_Germany
where
after
15
years
of
Soviet
rule
it
has
become
necessary
to
build
a
wall
to
keep
the
people
in
,
and
added
,
``
so_long
as
people
rebel
,
we
must_not
give_up
''
.
Martin
called_for
patience
on
the
part
of
Americans
.
``
The
countries
are
trying
to
build
in
a
decade
the
kind_of
society
we
took
a
century
to
build
''
,
he
said
.
By
leaving
our
doors
open
the
United_States
gives
other
peoples
the
opportunity
to
see
us
and
to
compare
,
he
said
.
``
We
have
no
reason
to
fear
failure
,
but
we
must
be
extraordinarily
patient
''
,
the
assistant
secretary
said
.
Economically
,
Martin
said
,
the
United_States
could
best
help
foreign
countries
by
helping
them
help
themselves
.
Private
business
is
more
effective
than
government
aid
,
he
explained
,
because
individuals
are
able
to
work
with
the
people
themselves
.
The
United_States
must
plan
to
absorb
the
exported
goods
of
the
country
,
at
what
he
termed
a
``
social
cost
''
.
Martin
said
the
government
has
been
working
to
establish
firmer
prices
on
primary
products
which
may
involve
the
total
income
of
one
country
.
The
Portland
school_board
was
asked
Monday
to
take
a
positive
stand
towards
developing
and
coordinating
with
Portland
's
civil_defense
more
plans
for
the
city
's
schools
in
event
of
attack
.
But
there
seemed
to
be
some
difference_of_opinion
as
to
how
far
the
board
should
go
,
and
whose
advice
it
should
follow
.
The
board_members
,
after
hearing
the
coordination
plea
from
Mrs._Ralph_H._Molvar
,
1409
SW_Maplecrest_Dr.
,
said
they
thought
they
had
already
been
cooperating
.
Chairman_C._Richard_Mears
pointed_out
that
perhaps
this
was
not
strictly
a
school_board
problem
,
in_case
of
atomic
attack
,
but
that
the
board
would
cooperate
so_far
as
possible
to
get
the
children
to
where
the
parents
wanted
them
to
go
.
Dr._Melvin_W._Barnes
,
superintendent
,
said
he
thought
the
schools
were
waiting
for
some
leadership
,
perhaps
on
the
national
level
,
to
make
sure
that
whatever
steps
of
planning
they
took
would
``
be
more
fruitful
''
,
and
that
he
had
found
that
other
school
districts
were
not
as
far
along
in
their
planning
as
this
district
.
``
Los_Angeles
has
said
they
would
send
the
children
to
their
homes
in_case
of
disaster
''
,
he
said
.
``
Nobody
really
expects
to
evacuate
.
I
think
everybody
is
agreed
that
we
need
to
hear
some
voice
on
the
national
level
that
would
make
some
sense
and
in_which
we
would
have
some
confidence
in
following
.
Mrs._Molvar
,
who
kept
reiterating
her
request
that
they
``
please
take
a
stand
''
,
said
,
``
We
must
have
faith
in
somebody
-
on
the
local
level
,
and
it
would
n't
be
possible
for
everyone
to
rush
to
a
school
to
get
their
children
''
.
Dr._Barnes
said
that
there
seemed
to
be
feeling
that
evacuation
plans
,
even
for
a
high_school
where
there
were
lots_of
cars
``
might
not
be
realistic
and
would
not
work
''
.
Mrs._Molvar
asked
again
that
the
board
join
in
taking
a
stand
in_keeping_with
Jack_Lowe
's
program
.
The
board
said
it
thought
it
had
gone
as
far
as
instructed
so_far
and
asked
for
more
information
to
be
brought
at
the
next
meeting
.
It
was
generally
agreed
that
the
subject
was
important
and
the
board
should
be
informed
on
what
was
done
,
is_going_to_be
done
and
what
it
thought
should
be
done
.

A
stronger
stand
on
their
beliefs
and
a
firmer
grasp
on
their
future
were
taken
Friday
by
delegates
to
the
29
th
general
council
of
the
Assemblies
of
God
,
in
session
at
the
Memorial_Coliseum
.
The
council
revised
,
in
an
effort
to
strengthen
,
the
denomination
's
16
basic
beliefs
adopted
in
1966
.
The
changes
,
unanimously
adopted
,
were
felt
necessary
in
the
face
of
modern
trends
away
from
the
Bible
.
The
council
agreed
it
should
more
firmly
state
its
belief
in
and
dependence
on
the
Bible
.
At
the
adoption
,
the
Rev._T._F._Zimmerman
,
general
superintendent
,
commented
,
``
The
Assemblies
of
God
has
been
a
bulwark
for
fundamentalism
in
these
modern
days
and
has
,
without
compromise
,
stood_for
the
great
truths
of
the
Bible
for
which
men
in_the_past
have
been
willing
to
give
their
lives
''
.
Many
changes
involved
minor
editing
and
clarification
;
however
,
the
first
belief
stood
for
entire
revision
with
a
new
third
point
added
to
the
list
.
The
first
of
16
beliefs
of
the
denomination
,
now
reads
:
``
The
scriptures
,
both
Old
and
New_Testament
,
are
verbally
inspired
of
God
and
are
the
revelation
of
God
to
man
,
the
infallible
,
authoritative
rule
of
faith
and
conduct
''
.
The
third
belief
,
in
six
points
,
emphasizes
the
Diety
of
the
Lord
Jesus_Christ
,
and
:
emphasizes
the_Virgin
birth
the
sinless
life
of
Christ
His
miracles
His
substitutionary
work
on
the
cross
His
bodily
resurrection
from
the
dead
and
His
exaltation
to
the
right_hand
of
God
.
Friday
afternoon
the
Rev._T._F._Zimmerman
was
reelected
for
his
second
consecutive
two-year
term
as
general
superintendent
of
Assemblies
of
God
.
His
offices
are
in
Springfield
,
Mo.
.
Election
came
on
the
nominating
ballot
.
Friday
night
the
delegates
heard
the
need
for
their
forthcoming
program
,
``
Breakthrough
''
scheduled
to
fill
the
churches
for
the
next
two
years
.
In
his
opening
address
Wednesday
the
Rev._Mr._Zimmerman
,
urged
the
delegates
to
consider
a
10
-
year
expansion
program
,
with
``
Breakthrough
''
the
theme
for
the
first
two
years
.
The
Rev._R._L._Brandt
,
national
secretary
of
the
home
missions
department
,
stressed
the
need
for
the
first
two
years
'
work
.
``
Surveys
show
that
one
out
of
three
Americans
has
vital
contact
with
the
church
.
This
means
that
more_than
100
million
have
no
vital
touch
with
the
church
or
religious
life
''
,
he
told
delegates
Friday
.
Talking
of
the
rapid
population
growth
(
upwards
of
12000
babies
born
daily
)
with
an
immigrant
entering
the
United_States
every
1
-
1
2
minutes
,
he
said
``
our
organization
has
not
been
keeping
pace
with
this
challenge
''
.
``
In
35
years
we
have
opened
7000
churches
''
,
the
Rev._Mr._Brandt
said
,
adding
that
the
denomination
had
a
national
goal
of
one
church
for
every
10000
persons
.
``
In_this
light
we
need
1000
churches
in
Illinois
,
where
we
have
200
;
800
in
Southern
New_England
,
we
have
60
;
we
need
100
in
Rhode_Island
,
we
have
none
''
,
he
said
.
To
step_up
the
denomination
's
program
,
the
Rev._Mr._Brandt
suggested
the
vision
of
8000
new
Assemblies
of
God
churches
in
the
next
10
years
.
To
accomplish
this
would
necessitate
some
changes
in
methods
,
he
said
.
``
The
church
's
ability
to
change
her
methods
is
going_to
determine
her
ability
to
meet
the
challenge
of_this
hour
''
.
A
capsule
view
of
proposed
plans
includes
:
Encouraging
by
every
means
,
all
existing
Assemblies
of
God
churches
to
start
new
churches
.
Engaging
mature
,
experienced
men
to
pioneer
or
open
new
churches
in
strategic
population
centers
.
Surrounding
pioneer
pastors
with
vocational
volunteers
(
laymen
,
who
will
be
urged
to
move_into
the
area
of
new
churches
in
the
interest
of
lending
their
support
to
the
new
project
)
.
Arranging
for
ministerial
graduates
to
spend
from
6
-
12
months
as
apprentices
in
well-established
churches
.
U._S.
Dist.
Judge_Charles_L._Powell
denied
all
motions
made
by
defense_attorneys
Monday
in
Portland
's
insurance
fraud
trial
.
Denials
were
of
motions
of
dismissal
,
continuance
,
mistrial
,
separate
trial
,
acquittal
,
striking
of
testimony
and
directed_verdict
.
In
denying
motions
for
dismissal
,
Judge_Powell
stated
that
mass
trials
have
been
upheld
as
proper
in
other
courts
and
that
``
a
person
may
join
a
conspiracy
without
knowing
who
all_of
the
conspirators
are
''
.
Attorney_Dwight_L._Schwab
,
in
behalf
of
defendant
Philip_Weinstein
,
argued
there
is
no
evidence
linking
Weinstein
to
the
conspiracy
,
but
Judge_Powell
declared
this
is
a
matter
for
the
jury
to
decide
.
Schwab
also
declared
there
is
no
proof
of
Weinstein
's
entering
a
conspiracy
to
use
the
U._S.
mails
to
defraud
,
to_which
federal
prosecutor
A._Lawrence_Burbank
replied
:
``
It
is
not
necessary
that
a
defendant
actually
have
conspired
to
use
the
U._S.
mails
to
defraud
as
long
as
there
is
evidence
of
a
conspiracy
,
and
the
mails
were
then
used
to
carry
it
out
''
.
In
the
afternoon
,
defense_attorneys
began
the
presentation
of
their
cases
with
opening
statements
,
some
of_which
had
been
deferred
until
after
the
government
had
called
witnesses
and
presented
its
case
.
