The
Fulton_County_Grand_Jury
said
Friday
an
investigation
of
Atlanta
's
recent
primary_election
produced
``
no
evidence
''
that
any
irregularities
took_place
.
The
jury
further
said
in
term
end
presentments
that
the
City_Executive_Committee
,
which
had
over-all
charge
of
the
election
,
``
deserves
the
praise
and
thanks
of
the
City_of_Atlanta
''
for
the
manner
in
which
the
election
was
conducted
.
The
September
October
term
jury
had
been
charged
by
Fulton
Superior_Court_Judge_Durwood_Pye
to
investigate
reports
of
possible
``
irregularities
''
in
the
hard-fought
primary
which
was
won
by
Mayor-nominate_Ivan_Allen_Jr.
.
``
Only
a
relative
handful
of
such
reports
was
received
''
,
the
jury
said
,
``
considering
the
widespread
interest
in
the
election
,
the
number
of
voters
and
the
size
of_this
city
''
.
The
jury
said
it
did
find
that
many_of
Georgia
's
registration
and
election
laws
``
are
outmoded
or
inadequate
and
often
ambiguous
''
.
It
recommended
that
Fulton
legislators
act
``
to
have
these
laws
studied
and
revised
to
the
end
of
modernizing
and
improving
them
''
.
The
grand_jury
commented
on
a
number
of
other
topics
,
among
them
the
Atlanta
and
Fulton_County
purchasing_departments
which
it
said
``
are
well
operated
and
follow
generally
accepted
practices
which
inure
to
the
best
interest
of
both
governments
''
.
However
,
the
jury
said
it
believes
``
these
two
offices
should
be
combined
to
achieve
greater
efficiency
and
reduce
the
cost
of
administration
''
.
The
City_Purchasing_Department
,
the
jury
said
,
``
is
lacking
in
experienced
clerical
personnel
as
a
result
of
city
personnel
policies
''
.
It
urged
that
the
city
``
take
steps
to
remedy
''
this
problem
.
Implementation
of
Georgia
's
automobile
title
law
was
also
recommended
by
the
outgoing
jury
.
It
urged
that
the
next
Legislature
``
provide
enabling
funds
and
re-set
the
effective
date
so_that
an
orderly
implementation
of
the
law
may
be
effected
''
.
The
grand_jury
took_a_swipe_at
the
State_Welfare_Department
's
handling
of
federal
funds
granted
for
child_welfare_services
in
foster_homes
.
``
This
is
one
of
the
major
items
in
the
Fulton_County
general
assistance
program
''
,
the
jury
said
,
but
the
State_Welfare_Department
``
has
seen_fit
to
distribute
these
funds
through
the
welfare
departments
of
all
the
counties
in
the
state
with
the
exception
of
Fulton_County
,
which
receives
none
of_this
money
.
The
jurors
said
they
realize
``
a
proportionate
distribution
of
these
funds
might
disable
this
program
in
our
less
populous
counties
''
.
Nevertheless
,
``
we
feel
that
in_the_future
Fulton_County
should
receive
some
portion
of
these
available
funds
''
,
the
jurors
said
.
``
Failure
to
do
this
will
continue
to
place
a
disproportionate
burden
''
on
Fulton
taxpayers
.
The
jury
also
commented
on
the
Fulton
ordinary
's
court
which
has
been
under_fire
for
its
practices
in
the
appointment
of
appraisers
,
guardians
and
administrators
and
the
awarding
of
fees
and
compensation
.
The
jury
said
it
found
the
court
``
has
incorporated
into
its
operating_procedures
the
recommendations
''
of
two
previous
grand_juries
,
the
Atlanta_Bar_Association
and
an
interim
citizens_committee
.
``
These
actions
should
serve
to
protect
in_fact
and
in_effect
the
court
's
wards
from
undue
costs
and
its
appointed
and
elected
servants
from
unmeritorious
criticisms
''
,
the
jury
said
.
Regarding
Atlanta
's
new
million
dollar
airport
,
the
jury
recommended
``
that
when
the
new
management
takes_charge
Jan.
1
the
airport
be
operated
in
a
manner
that
will
eliminate
political
influences
''
.
The
jury
did
not
elaborate
,
but
it
added
that
``
there
should
be
periodic
surveillance
of
the
pricing
practices
of
the
concessionaires
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
prices
reasonable
''
.
On
other
matters
,
the
jury
recommended
that
:
Four
additional
deputies
be
employed
at
the
Fulton_County_Jail
and
``
a
doctor
,
medical_intern
or
extern
be
employed
for
night
and
weekend
duty
at
the
jail
''
.
Fulton
legislators
``
work
with
city
officials
to
pass
enabling_legislation
that
will
permit
the
establishment
of
a
fair
and
equitable
''
pension
plan
for
city
employes
.
The
jury
praised
the
administration
and
operation
of
the
Atlanta
Police_Department
,
the
Fulton_Tax_Commissioner_'s_Office
,
the
Bellwood
and
Alpharetta
prison_farms
,
Grady_Hospital
and
the
Fulton_Health_Department

Mayor_William_B._Hartsfield
filed
suit
for
divorce
from
his
wife
,
Pearl_Williams_Hartsfield
,
in
Fulton_Superior_Court
Friday
.
His
petition
charged
mental
cruelty
.
The
couple
was
married
Aug.
2
,
1913
.
They
have
a
son
,
William_Berry_Jr.
,
and
a
daughter
,
Mrs._J._M._Cheshire
of
Griffin
.
Attorneys
for
the
mayor
said
that
an
amicable
property_settlement
has
been
agreed_upon
.
The
petition
listed
the
mayor
's
occupation
as
``
attorney
''
and
his
age
as
71
.
It
listed
his
wife
's
age
as
74
and
place_of_birth
as
Opelika_,_Ala.
.
The
petition
said
that
the
couple
has
not
lived
together
as
man_and_wife
for
more
than
a
year
.
The
Hartsfield
home
is
at
637
E._Pelham_Rd._NE
.
Henry_L._Bowden
was
listed
on
the
petition
as
the
mayor
's
attorney
.
Hartsfield
has
been
mayor
of
Atlanta
,
with
exception
of
one
brief
interlude
,
since
1937
.
His
political
career
goes_back
to
his
election
to
city_council
in
1923
.
The
mayor
's
present
term_of_office
expires
Jan.
1
.
He
will
be
succeeded
by
Ivan_Allen_Jr.
,
who
became
a
candidate
in
the
Sept.
13
primary
after
Mayor_Hartsfield
announced
that
he
would
not
run
for
reelection
.
Georgia
Republicans
are
getting
strong
encouragement
to
enter
a
candidate
in
the
1962
governor_'s_race
,
a
top
official
said
Wednesday
.
Robert_Snodgrass
,
state
GOP
chairman
,
said
a
meeting
held
Tuesday
night
in
Blue_Ridge
brought
enthusiastic
responses
from
the
audience
.
State_Party_Chairman_James_W._Dorsey
added
that
enthusiasm
was
picking_up
for
a
state
rally
to
be
held
Sept.
8
in
Savannah
at
which
newly
elected
Texas
Sen._John_Tower
will
be
the
featured
speaker
.
In
the
Blue_Ridge
meeting
,
the
audience
was
warned
that
entering
a
candidate
for
governor
would
force
it
to
take
petitions
out
into
voting_precincts
to
obtain
the
signatures
of
registered
voters
.
Despite
the
warning
,
there
was
a
unanimous
vote
to
enter
a
candidate
,
according_to
Republicans
who
attended
.
When
the
crowd
was
asked
whether
it
wanted
to
wait
one
more
term
to
make
the
race
,
it
voted
no
-
and
there
were
no
dissents
.
The
largest
hurdle
the
Republicans
would
have
to
face
is
a
state
law
which
says
that
before
making
a
first
race
,
one
of
two
alternative
courses
must
be
taken
:
Five
per_cent
of
the
voters
in
each
county
must
sign
petitions
requesting
that
the
Republicans
be
allowed
to
place
names
of
candidates
on
the
general_election
ballot
,
or
The
Republicans
must
hold
a
primary
under
the
county
unit
system
-
a
system
which
the
party
opposes
in
its
platform
.
Sam_Caldwell
,
State_Highway_Department
public_relations
director
,
resigned
Tuesday
to
work
for
Lt._Gov._Garland_Byrd
's
campaign
.
Caldwell
's
resignation
had
been
expected
for
some
time
.
He
will
be
succeeded
by
Rob_Ledford
of
Gainesville
,
who
has
been
an
assistant
more
than
three
years
.
When
the
gubernatorial
campaign
starts
,
Caldwell
is
expected
to
become
a
campaign
coordinator
for
Byrd
.
The
Georgia_Legislature
will
wind_up
its
1961
session
Monday
and
head
for
home
-
where
some
of
the
highway
bond
money
it
approved
will
follow
shortly
.
Before
adjournment
Monday
afternoon
,
the
Senate
is
expected
to
approve
a
study
of
the
number
of
legislators
allotted
to
rural
and
urban_areas
to
determine
what
adjustments
should
be
made
.
Gov._Vandiver
is
expected
to
make
the
traditional
visit
to
both
chambers
as
they
work
toward
adjournment
.
Vandiver
likely
will
mention
the
$
100
million
highway
bond
issue
approved
earlier
in
the
session
as
his
first
priority
item
.
Meanwhile
,
it
was
learned
the
State_Highway_Department
is
very
near
being
ready
to
issue
the
first
$
30
million
worth
of
highway
reconstruction
bonds
.
The
bond
issue
will
go
to
the
state
courts
for
a
friendly
test_suit
to
test
the
validity
of
the
act
,
and_then
the
sales
will
begin
and
contracts
let
for
repair
work
on
some
of
Georgia
's
most
heavily
traveled
highways
.
A
Highway_Department
source
said
there
also
is
a
plan
there
to
issue
some
$
3
million
to
$
4
million
worth
of
Rural_Roads_Authority
bonds
for
rural
road
construction
work
.
The
department
apparently
intends
to
make
the
Rural_Roads_Authority
a
revolving_fund
under
which
new
bonds
would
be
issued
every
time
a
portion
of
the
old
ones
are
paid_off
by
tax
authorities
.
Vandiver
opened
his
race
for
governor
in
1958
with
a
battle
in
the
Legislature
against
the
issuance
of
$
50
million
worth
of
additional
rural
roads
bonds
proposed
by
then
Gov._Marvin_Griffin
.
The
Highway_Department
source
told
The_Constitution
,
however
,
that
Vandiver
has
not
been
consulted
yet
about
the
plans
to
issue
the
new
rural
roads
bonds
.
Schley_County_Rep._B._D._Pelham
will
offer
a
resolution
Monday
in
the
House
to
rescind
the
body
's
action
of
Friday
in
voting
itself
a
$
10
per
day
increase
in
expense
allowances
.
Pelham
said
Sunday
night
there
was
research
being
done
on
whether
the
``
quickie
''
vote
on
the
increase
can
be
repealed
outright
or
whether
notice
would
have
to
first
be
given
that
reconsideration
of
the
action
would
be
sought
.
While
emphasizing
that
technical
details
were
not
fully
worked_out
,
Pelham
said
his
resolution
would
seek
to
set_aside
the
privilege
resolution
which
the
House
voted
through
87
-
31
.
A
similar
resolution
passed
in
the
Senate
by
a
vote
of
29
-
5
.
As
of
Sunday
night
,
there
was
no
word
of
a
resolution
being
offered
there
to
rescind
the
action
.
Pelham
pointed_out
that
Georgia
voters
last
November
rejected
a
constitutional
amendment
to
allow
legislators
to
vote
on
pay
raises
for
future
Legislature
sessions
.
A
veteran
Jackson_County
legislator
will
ask
the
Georgia_House
Monday
to
back
federal
aid
to
education
,
something
it
has
consistently
opposed
in
the
past
.
Rep._Mac_Barber
of
Commerce
is
asking
the
House
in
a
privilege
resolution
to
``
endorse
increased
federal
support
for
public
education
,
provided_that
such
funds
be
received
and
expended
''
as
state
funds
.
Barber
,
who
is
in
his
13th
year
as
a
legislator
,
said
there
``
are
some
members
of
our
congressional
delegation
in
Washington
who
would_like
to
see
it
(
the
resolution
)
passed
''
.
But
he
added
that
none
of
Georgia
's
congressmen
specifically
asked
him
to
offer
the
resolution
.
The
resolution
,
which
Barber
tossed
into
the
House
hopper
Friday
,
will
be
formally
read
Monday
.
It
says
that
``
in
the
event
Congress
does
provide
this
increase
in
federal
funds
''
,
the
State_Board_of_Education
should
be
directed
to
``
give
priority
''
to
teacher
pay
raises
.
After
a
long
,
hot
controversy
,
Miller_County
has
a
new
school_superintendent
,
elected
,
as
a
policeman
put
it
,
in
the
``
coolest
election
I
ever
saw
in_this
county
''
.
The
new
school_superintendent
is
Harry_Davis
,
a
veteran
agriculture
teacher
,
who
defeated
Felix_Bush
,
a
school_principal
and
chairman
of
the
Miller_County_Democratic_Executive_Committee
.
Davis
received
1119
votes
in
Saturday
's
election
,
and
Bush
got
402
.
Ordinary
Carey_Williams
,
armed
with
a
pistol
,
stood_by
at
the
polls
to
insure
order
.
``
This
was
the
coolest
,
calmest
election
I
ever
saw
''
,
Colquitt_Policeman_Tom_Williams
said
.
``
Being
at
the
polls
was
just
like
being
at
church
.
I
did
n't
smell
a
drop
of
liquor
,
and
we
did
n't
have
a_bit
of
trouble
''
.
The
campaign
leading
to
the
election
was
not
so
quiet
,
however
.
It
was
marked
by
controversy
,
anonymous
midnight
phone_calls
and
veiled
threats
of
violence
.
The
former
county
school_superintendent
,
George_P._Callan
,
shot
himself
to
death
March
18
,
four
days
after
he
resigned
his
post
in
a
dispute
with
the
county
school_board
.
During
the
election
campaign
,
both
candidates
,
Davis
and
Bush
,
reportedly
received
anonymous
telephone_calls
.
Ordinary
Williams
said
he
,
too
,
was
subjected
to
anonymous
calls
soon
after
he
scheduled
the
election
.
Many
local
citizens
feared
that
there
would
be
irregularities
at
the
polls
,
and
Williams
got
himself
a
permit
to
carry
a
gun
and
promised
an
orderly
election
.
Sheriff_Felix_Tabb
said
the
ordinary
apparently
made_good
his
promise
.
``
Everything
went
real
smooth
''
,
the
sheriff
said
.
``
There
was
n't
a_bit
of
trouble
''
.
