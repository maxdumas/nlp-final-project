The
General_Assembly
,
which
adjourns
today
,
has
performed
in
an
atmosphere
of
crisis
and
struggle
from
the
day
it
convened
.
It
was
faced
immediately
with
a
showdown
on
the
schools
,
an
issue
which
was
met
squarely
in
conjunction
with
the
governor
with
a
decision
not
to
risk
abandoning
public
education
.
There
followed
the
historic
appropriations
and
budget
fight
,
in_which
the
General_Assembly
decided
to
tackle
executive
powers
.
The
final_decision
went
to
the
executive
but
a
way
has
been
opened
for
strengthening
budgeting
procedures
and
to
provide
legislators
information
they
need
.
Long-range
planning
of
programs
and
ways
to
finance
them
have
become
musts
if
the
state
in
the
next
few
years
is
to
avoid
crisis-to-crisis
government
.
This
session
,
for_instance
,
may
have
insured
a
financial
crisis
two
years
from
now
.
In_all
the
turmoil
,
some
good
legislation
was
passed
.
Some
other
good
bills
were
lost
in
the
shuffle
and
await
future
action
.
Certainly
all
can
applaud
passage
of
an
auto
title
law
,
the
school
bills
,
the
increase
in
teacher
pensions
,
the
ban
on
drag
racing
,
acceptance
by
the
state
of
responsibility
for
maintenance
of
state
roads
in
municipalities
at
the
same
rate
as
outside
city_limits
,
repeal
of
the
college
age
limit
law
and
the
road
maintenance
bond
issue
.
No
action
has
been
taken
,
however
,
on
such
major
problems
as
ending
the
fee
system
,
penal
reform
,
modification
of
the
county
unit
system
and
in
outright
banning
of
fireworks
sales
.
Only
a
token
start
was
made
in
attacking
the
tax
reappraisal
question
and
its
companion
issue
of
attracting
industry
to
the
state
.
The
legislature
expended
most_of
its
time
on
the
schools
and
appropriations
questions
.
Fortunately
it
spared
us
from
the
usual
spate
of
silly
resolutions
which
in_the_past
have
made
Georgia
look_like
anything
but
``
the
empire_state_of_the_South
''
.
We
congratulate
the
entire
membership
on
its
record
of
good
legislation
.
In
the
interim
between
now
and
next
year
,
we
trust
the
House
and
Senate
will
put
their
minds
to
studying
Georgia
's
very
real
economic
,
fiscal
and
social
problems
and
come_up
with
answers
without
all
the
political
heroics
.
The
League
of
Women
Voters
,
40
now
and
admitting
it
proudly
,
is
inviting
financial
contributions
in
the
windup
of
its
fund
drive
.
It
's
a
good
use
of
money
.
These
women
whose
organization
grew
out
of
the
old
suffrage
movement
are
dedicated_to
Thomas_Jefferson
's
dictum
that
one
must
cherish
the
people
's
spirit
but
``
Keep
alive
their
attention
''
.
``
If
once
they
become
inattentive_to
the
public
affairs
''
,
Jefferson
said
,
``
you
and
I
,
and
Congress
and
assemblies
,
judges
and
governors
,
shall
all
become
wolves
''
.
Newspapermen
and
politicians
especially
are
aware_of
the
penetrating
attention
and
expert
analysis
the
league
gives
to
public
affairs
.
The
league
workers
search
out
the
pros
and
cons
of
the_most
complex
issues
and
make
them
available
to
the
public
.
The
harder
the
choice
,
the
more
willing
the
league
is
to
wade
in
.
And
the
league
takes
a
stand
,
with
great
regularity
,
on_the_side
of_right
.
Cities
and
counties
interested
in
industrial
development
would
do_well
in
the
months
ahead
to
keep
their
eyes
peeled
toward
the
13
northwest
Georgia
counties
that
are
members
of
the
Coosa_Valley_Area_Planning
and
Development_Commission
.
Coupling
its
own
budget
of
$
83750
with
a
$
30000
state
grant
authorized
by
Gov._Vandiver
,
the
group
expects
to
sign
a
contract
in
March
with
Georgia_Tech.
.
Then
a
full-time
planning
office
will
be
established
in
Rome
to
work
with
a
five-member
Georgia_Tech
research_staff
for
development
of
an
area
planning
and
industrial
development
program
.
The
undertaking
has
abundant
promise
.
It
recognizes
the
fact
that
what
helps
one
county
helps
its
neighbors
and
that
by
banding_together
in
an
area-wide
effort
better
results
can
be
accomplished
than
through
the
go-it-alone
approach
.
The
Rusk
belief
in
balanced
defense
,
replacing
the
Dulles
theory
of
massive
retaliation
,
removes
a
grave
danger
that
has
existed
.
The
danger
lay
not
in
believing
that
our
own
A-bombs
would
deter
Russia
's
use
of
hers
;
that
theory
was
and
is
sound
.
The
danger
lay_in
the
American
delusion
that
nuclear
deterrence
was
enough
.
By
limiting
American
strength
too_much
to
nuclear
strength
,
this
country
limited
its
ability
to
fight
any
kind_of
war
besides
a
nuclear
war
.
This
strategy
heightened
the
possibility
that
we
would
have
a
nuclear
war
.
It
also
weakened
our
diplomatic
stance
,
because
Russia
could
easily
guess
we
did
not
desire
a
nuclear
war
except
in
the
ultimate
extremity
.
This
left
the
Soviets
plenty
of
leeway
to
start
low-grade
brushfire
aggressions
with
considerable
impunity
.
By
maintaining
the
nuclear
deterrent
,
but
gearing
American
military_forces
to
fight
conventional
wars
too
,
Secretary_of_State
Rusk
junks
bluff
and
nuclear
brinkmanship
and
builds
more
muscle
and
greater
safety
into
our
military
position
.
DeKalb
's
budget
for
1961
is
a
record
one
and
carries
with_it
the
promise
of
no
tax
increase
to
make
it
balance
.
It
includes
a
raise
in
the
county
minimum_wage
,
creation
of
several
new
jobs
at
the
executive
level
,
financing
of
beefed-up
industrial
development
efforts
,
and
increased
expenditures
for
essential
services
such_as
health
and
welfare
,
fire
protection
,
sanitation
and
road
maintenance
.
That
such
expansion
can
be
obtained
without
a
raise
in
taxes
is_due
to
growth
of
the
tax
digest
and
sound
fiscal
planning
on
the
part
of
the
board
of
commissioners
,
headed
by
Chairman_Charles_O._Emmerich
who
is
demonstrating
that
the
public
trust
he
was
given
was
well
placed
,
and
other
county
officials
.
G._Mennen_Williams
is

Confidence
in
the
state
's
economic
future
is
reflected
in
the
Georgia
Power_Company
's
record
construction
budget
for
this
year
.
The
firm
does
a
large
amount
of
research
and
its
forecasts
have
meaning
.
It
is
good
to
know
that
Georgia
will
continue
to
have
sufficient
electrical_power
not_only
to
meet
the
demands
of
normal
growth
but
to
encourage
a
more
rapid
rate
of
industrialization
.
Georgia
's
mental_health
program
received
a
badly
needed
boost
from
the
General_Assembly
in
the
form
of
a
$
1750000
budget
increase
for
the
Milledgeville_State_Hospital
.
Actually
it
amounts
to
$
1250000
above
what
the
institution
already
is
receiving
,
considering
the
additional
half-million
dollars
Gov._Vandiver
allocated
last
year
from
the
state
surplus
.
Either
way
it
sounds
like
a
sizable
hunk
of
money
and
is
.
But
exactly
how
far
it
will
go
toward
improving
conditions
is
another
question
because
there
is
so_much
that
needs
doing
.
The
practice
of
charging
employes
for
meals
whether
they
eat
at
the
hospital
or
not
should
be
abolished
.
The
work
week
of
attendants
who
are
on_duty
65
hours
and
more
per
week
should
be
reduced
.
More
attendants
,
nurses
and
doctors
should
be
hired
.
Patients
deserve
more
attention
than
they
are
getting
.
Even
with
the
increase
in
funds
for
the
next
fiscal_year
,
Georgia
will
be
spending
only
around
$
3.15
per
day
per
patient
.
The
national
average
is
more_than
$
4
and
that
figure
is
considered
by
experts
in
the
mental_health
field
to
be
too
low
.
Kansas
,
regarded_as
tops
in
the
nation
in
its
treatment
of
the
mentally_ill
,
spends
$
9
per
day
per
patient
.
Georgia
has
made
some
reforms
,
true
.
The
intensive
treatment
program
is
working
well
.
But
in
so
many
other
areas
we
still
are
dragging
.
Considering
what
is
being
done
compared
to
what
needs
to
be
done
,
it
behooves
the
hospital
management
to
do
some
mighty
careful
planning
toward
making
the
best
possible
use
of
the
increase
granted
.
The
boost
is
helpful
but
inadequate
.
Assassination
,
even
of
a
tyrant
,
is
repulsive
to
men
of
good
conscience
.
Rafael_Trujillo
,
the
often-blood
thirsty
dictator
of
the
Dominican_Republic
for
31
years
,
perhaps
deserved
his
fate
in
an
even-handed
appraisal
of
history
.
But
whether
the
murder
of
El_Benefactor
in
Ciudad_Trujillo
means
freedom
for
the
people
of
the
Caribbean
fiefdom
is
a
question
that
cannot
now
be
answered
.
Trujillo
knew
a
great_deal
about
assassination
.
The
responsibility
for
scores
of
deaths
,
including
the
abduction
and
murder
of
Jesus_Maria_Galindez
,
a
professor
at
Columbia_University
in
New_York
,
has
been
laid
at
his
door
.
He
had
been
involved
in
countless
schemes
to
do_away_with
democratic
leaders
in
neighboring
countries
such_as
President_Romulo_Betancourt
of
Venezuela
.
It
was
a
sort_of
poetic_justice
that
at_the_time
of
his
own
demise
a
new
plot
to
overthrow
the
Venezuelan
government
,
reportedly
involving
the
use
of
Dominican
arms
by
former
Venezuelan
Dictator_Marcos_Perez_Jimenez
,
has
been
uncovered
and
quashed
.
The
recent
history
of
the
Dominican_Republic
is
an
almost
classical
study
of
the
way
in_which
even
a
professedly
benevolent
dictatorship
tends
to
become
oppressive
.
Unquestionably
Trujillo
did
some
good
things
for
his
country
:
he
improved
public
facilities
such_as
roads
and
sanitation
,
attracted
industry
and
investment
and
raised
the
standard_of_living
notably
.
But
the
price
was
the
silence
of
the
grave
for
all
criticism
or
opposition
.
El_Benefactor
's
vanity
grew
with
his
personal
wealth
.
The
jails
were
filled
to
overflowing_with
political_prisoners
who
had
incurred
his
displeasure
.
He
maintained
amply
financed
lobbies
in
the
United_States
and
elsewhere
which
sycophantically
chanted
his
praise
,
and
his
influence
extended
even
to
Congress
.
Until
the
last
year
or_so
the
profession
of
friendship
with
the
United_States
had
been
an
article
of
faith
with
Trujillo
,
and
altogether
too
often
this
profession
was
accepted
here
as
evidence
of
his
good
character
.
Tardily
the
Government
here
came
to
understand
how
this
country
's
own
reputation
was
tarnished
by
the
association
with
repression
.
Last
year
,
after
Trujillo
had
been
cited
for
numerous
aggressions
in
the
Caribbean
,
the
United_States
and
many
other
members
of
the
Organization_of_American_States
broke
diplomatic
relations
with
him
.
Thereupon
followed
a
demonstration
that
tyranny
knows
no
ideological
confines
.
Trujillo
's
dictatorship
had
been
along
conservative
,
right-wing
lines
.
But
after
the
censure
he
and
his
propaganda
started
mouthing
Communist
slogans
.
There
was
considerable
evidence
of
a
tacit
rapprochement
with
Castro
in
Cuba
,
previously
a
bete_noire
to
Trujillo
-
thus
illustrating
the
way
in_which
totalitarianism
of
the
right
and
left
coalesces
.
What
comes_after
Trujillo
is
now
the
puzzle
.
The
Dominican
people
have
known
no
democratic
institutions
and
precious
little
freedom
for
a
generation
,
and
all
alternative
leadership
has
been
suppressed
.
Perhaps
the
army
will
be
able
to
maintain
stability
,
but
the
vacuum
of
free
institutions
creates
a
great
danger
.
The
Dominican_Republic
could
turn
toward
Communist-type
authoritarianism
as
easily
as
toward
Western
freedom
.
Such
a
twist
would
be
a
tragedy
for
the
Dominican
people
,
who
deserve
to
breathe
without_fear
.
For
that
reason
any
democratic
reform
and
effort
to
bring
genuine
representative
government
to
the
Dominican_Republic
will
need
the
greatest
sympathy
and
help
.
High-speed
buses
on
the
George_Washington
Memorial_Parkway
,
operating
between
downtown
Washington
and
Cabin_John
,
Glen_Echo
and
Brookmont
,
would
constitute
an
alluring
sample
of_what
the
new
National_Capital
Transportation_Agency
can
do
for
this
city
.
In
presenting
plans
for
such
express_buses
before
the
Montgomery_County_Council
,
the
administrator
of
the
NCTA
,
C._Darwin_Stolzenbach
,
was
frankly
seeking
support
for
the
projects
his
agency
will
soon
be
launching
.
Such
support
should
not
be
difficult
to
come_by
if
all
the
plans
to
be
presented
by
the
NCTA
are
as
attractive
as
this
outline
of
express_buses
coming
into
the
downtown
area
.
Because
the
buses
would
not
stop
on
the
parkway
,
land
for
bus_stations
and
for
parking_areas
nearby
will
be
needed
.
The
NCTA
is
well-advised
to
seek
funds
for
this
purpose
from
the
present
session
of
Congress
.
