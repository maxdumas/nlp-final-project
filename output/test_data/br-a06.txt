James_P._Mitchell
and
Sen._Walter_H._Jones_R-Bergen
,
last
night
disagreed
on
the
value
of
using
as
a
campaign
issue
a
remark
by
Richard_J._Hughes
,
Democratic
gubernatorial
candidate
,
that
the
GOP
is
``
Campaigning
on
the
carcass
of
Eisenhower_Republicanism
''
.
Mitchell
was
for
using
it
,
Jones
against
,
and
Sen._Wayne_Dumont_Jr._R-Warren
did
not
mention
it
when
the
three
Republican
gubernatorial
candidates
spoke
at
staggered
intervals
before
100
persons
at
the
Park_Hotel
.
The
controversial
remark
was
first
made
Sunday
by
Hughes
at
a
Westfield_Young_Democratic_Club
cocktail_party
at
the
Scotch_Plains
Country_Club
.
It
was
greeted
with
a
chorus
of
boos
by
500
women
in
Trenton_Monday
at
a
forum
of
the
State_Federation
of
Women
's
Clubs
.
Hughes
said
Monday
,
``
It
is
the
apparent
intention
of
the
Republican_Party
to
campaign
on
the
carcass
of_what
they
call
Eisenhower_Republicanism
,
but
the
heart
stopped
beating
and
the
lifeblood
congealed
after
Eisenhower
retired
.
Now
he
's
gone
,
the
Republican_Party
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
sell
the
tattered
remains
to
the
people
of
the
state
''
.
Sunday
he
had
added
,
``
We
can
love
Eisenhower
the
man
,
even
if
we
considered
him
a
mediocre
president
but
there
is
nothing
left
of
the
Republican_Party
without
his
leadership
''
.
Mitchell
said
the
statement
should
become
a
major
issue
in
the
primary
and
the
fall
campaign
.
``
How
can
a
man
with
any
degree
of
common
decency
charge
this
''
?
he
asked
.
The
former
secretary
of
labor
said
he
was
proud
to
be
an
Eisenhower_Republican
``
and
proud
to
have
absorbed
his
philosophy
''
while
working
in
his
adminstration
.
Mitchell
said
the
closeness
of
the
outcome
in
last
fall
's
Presidential
election
did
not
mean
that
Eisenhower_Republicanism
was
a
dead
issue
.
Jones
said
he
regretted
Hughes
had
made
a
personal
attack
on
a
past
president
.
``
He
is
wrong
to
inject
Eisenhower
into
this
campaign
''
,
he
said
,
``
because
the
primary
is
being
waged
on
state
issues
and
I
will
not
be
forced
into
re_arguing
an
old
national
campaign
''
.
The
audience
last
night
did
not
respond
with
either
applause
or
boos
to
mention
of
Hughes
'
remark
.
Dumont
spoke
on
the
merit
of
having
an
open_primary
.
He
then
launched
into
what
the
issues
should
be
in
the
campaign
.
State
aid
to
schools
,
the
continuance
of
railroad
passenger
service
,
the
proper
uses
of
surplus
funds
of
the
Port
of
New_York
Authority
,
and
making
New_Jersey
attractive
to
new
industry
.
Mitchell
decried
the
high
rate
of
unemployment
in
the
state
and
said
the
Meyner
administration
and
the
Republican-controlled
State_Senate
``
Must
share
the
blame
for
this
''
.
Nothing
that
Plainfield
last
year
had
lost
the
Mack_Truck_Co.
plant
,
he
said
industry
will
not
come
into
this
state
until
there
is
tax
reform
.
``
But
I
am
not
in
favor
of
a
sales
or
state
income_tax
at
this
time
''
,
Mitchell
said
.
Jones
,
unhappy
that
the
candidates
were
limited
to
eight
minutes
for
a
speech
and
no
audience
questions
,
saved
his
barbs
for
Mitchell
.
He
said
Mitchell
is
against
the
centralization
of
government
in
Washington
but
looks_to
the
Kennedy_Administration
for
aid
to
meet
New_Jersey
school
and
transportation
crises
.
``
He
calls_for
help
while
saying
he
is
against
centralization
,
but
you
can
n't
have
it
both
ways
''
,
Jones
said
.
The
state
is
now
faced
with
the
immediate
question
of
raising
new
taxes
whether
on
utilities
,
real_estate
or
motor_vehicles
,
he
said
,
``
and
I
challenge
Mitchell
to
tell
the
people
where
he
stands
on
the
tax
issue
''
.
Earlier
,
Mitchell
said
in
a
statement
:
``
I
think
that
all
Americans
will
resent
deeply
the
statements
made
about
President_Eisenhower
by
Richard_J._Hughes
.
His
reference_to
'
discredited
carcass
'
or
'
tattered
remains
'
of
the
president
's
leadership
is
an
insult
to
the
man
who
led
our
forces
to
victory
in
the
greatest
war
in_all
history
,
to
the
man
who
was
twice
elected
overwhelmingly
by
the
American
people
as
president_of_the_United_States
,
and
who
has
been
the
symbol
to
the
world
of
the
peace-loving
intentions
of
the
free
nations
.
``
I
find
it
hard
to
understand
how
anyone
seeking
a
position
in_public
life
could
demonstrate
such
poor
judgment
and
bad
taste
.
``
Such
a
vicious
statement
can
only
have
its
origin
in
the
desire
of
a
new
political
candidate
to
try
to
make
his
name
known
by
condemning
a
man
of
world
stature
.
It
can
only
rebound
to
Mr._Hughes
'
discredit
''
.
Sen._Charles_W._Sandman
,
R-Cape_May
,
said
today
Jones
will
run
well
ahead
of
his
GOP
opponents
for
the
gubernatorial
nomination
.
Sandman
,
state
campaign
chairman
for
Jones
,
was
addressing
a
meeting
in
the
Military_Park_Hotel
,
Newark
,
of
Essex_County
leaders
and
campaign
managers
for
Jones
.
Sandman
told
the
gathering
that
reports
from
workers
on
a
local
level
all_over
the
state
indicate
that
Jones
will
be
chosen
the
Republican_Party
's
nominee
with
the
largest
majority
given
a
candidate
in
recent
years
.
Sandman
said
:
``
The
announcement
that
Sen._Clifford_Case_R-N._J.
,
has
decided
to
spend
all
his
available
time
campaigning
for
Mr._Mitchell
is
a
dead
giveaway
.
It
is
a
desperate
effort
to
prop_up
a
sagging
candidate
who
has
proven
he
cannot
answer
any
questions
about
New_Jersey
's
problems
.
``
We
have
witnessed
in_this
campaign
the
effort
to
project
Mr._Mitchell
as
the
image
of
a
unity
candidate
from
Washington
.
That
failed
.
``
We
are
now
witnessing
an
effort
to
transfer
to
Mr._Mitchell
some
of
the
glow
of
Sen._Case
's
candidacy
of
last
year
.
That
,
too
,
will
fail
''
.
Sandman
announced
the
appointment
of
Mrs._Harriet_Copeland_Greenfield
of
330
Woodland_Ave.
,
Westfield
,
as
state
chairman
of
the
Republican_Women
for
Jones_Committee

Mrs._Greenfield
is
president
of
the
Westfield_Women
's
Republican_Club

Westfield
county
committeewoman
.
County_Supervisor_Weldon_R._Sheets
,
who
is
a
candidate
for
the
Democratic
gubernatorial
nomination
,
today
called_for
an
end
to
paper
ballots
in
those
counties
in
the
state
which
still
use
them
.
The
proposal
,
Sheets
said
,
represents
part
of
his
program
for
election
reforms
necessary
to
make
democracy
in
New_Jersey
more_than
a
``
lip_service
word
''
.
Sheets
said
that
his
proposed
law
would
offer
state
financing
aid
for
the
purchase
of
voting_machines
,
enabling
counties
to
repay
the
loan
over
a
10
-
year
period
without
interest
or
charge
.
Sheets
added
that
he
would
ask
for
exclusive
use
of
voting_machines
in
the
state
by
January
,
1964
.
Although
he
pointed_out
that
mandatory
legislation
impinging_on
home_rule
is
basically
distasteful
,
he
added
that
the
vital
interest
in
election
results
transcended
county_lines
.
The
candidacy
of
Mayor_James_J._Sheeran
of
West_Orange
,
for
the
Republican
nomination
for
sheriff
of
Essex_County
,
was
supported
today
by
Edward_W._Roos
,
West_Orange
public
safety
commissioner
.
Sheeran
,
a
lawyer
and
former
FBI
man
is_running
against
the
Republican
organization
's
candidate
,
Freeholder_William_MacDonald
,
for
the
vacancy
left
by
the
resignation
of
Neil_Duffy
,
now
a
member
of
the
State_Board
of
Tax
Appeals
.
``
My
experience
as
public
safety
commissioner
''
,
Roos
said
,
``
has
shown
me
that
the
office
of
sheriff
is
best
filled
by
a
man
with
law_enforcement
experience
,
and
preferably
one
who
is
a
lawyer

William_J._Seidel
,
state
fire_warden
in
the
Department
of
Conservation
and
Economic_Development
,
has
retired
after
36
years
of
service
.
A
citation
from
Conservation_Commissioner_Salvatore_A._Bontempo
credits
his
supervision
with
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
forest_fires
in
the
state
.
Seidel
joined
the
department
in
1925
as
a
division
fire_warden
after
graduation
in
1921
from
the
University
of
Michigan
with
a
degree
in
forestry
and
employment
with
private
lumber
companies
.
In
October
1944
,
he
was
appointed
state
warden
and
chief
of
the
Forest_Fire
Section
.
Under
his
supervision
,
the
state
fire-fighting
agency
developed
such
techniques
as
plowing
of
fire
lines
and
established
a
fleet
of
tractor
plows
and
tractor
units
for
fire
fighting
.
He
also
expanded
and
modernized
the
radio
system
with
a
central
control
station
.
He
introduced
regular
briefing
sessions
for
district
fire_wardens
and
first_aid
training
for
section
wardens
.
He
is
credited
with
setting_up
an
annual
co-operative
fire
prevention
program
in
co-operation
with
the
Red_Cross
and
State_Department
of
Education
.
Richard_J._Hughes
made
his
Morris_County
debut
in
his
bid
for
the
Democratic
gubernatorial
nomination
here
last
night
with
a
pledge
``
to
carry
the
issues
to
every
corner
of
the
state
''
.
He
promised
nearly
200
Democratic
county
committee_members
at
the
meeting
in
the
Puddingstone_Inn
:
``
When
I
come_back
here
after
the
November
election
you
'll
think
,
'
You
're
my
man
-
you
're
the
kind_of
governor
we
're
glad
we
elected
''
'
.
He
said
,
``
We
Democrats
must
resolve
our
issues
on
the
test
of_what
is
right
and
just
,
and
not
what
is
expedient
at_the_time
''
.
In
his
only
attack
on
the
Republicans
,
Hughes
said
,
``
The
three
Republican
candidates
for
governor
are
tripping
over
their
feet
for
popular
slogans
to
win
the
primary
.
But
we
'll
have
a
liberal
,
well
planned
,
forward
looking
,
honest
platform
.
We
'll
not
talk
out
of
one
side
of
our
mouth
in
Morris_County
and
out
of
the
other
side
in
Hudson
.
``
We
'll
take
the
truth
to
the
people
,
and
the
people
will
like
the
truth
and
elect
their
candidate
and
party
in
November
''
.
He
said
,
``
You
can
see
signs
of
the
Republicans
'
feeble
attack
on
the
Meyner
administration
.
But
I
shall
campaign
on
the
Meyner
record
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
years
ahead
''
.
He
urged
New_Jersey
to
``
become
a
full
partner
in
the
courageous
actions
of
President_Kennedy
''
.
He
called_for
a
greater
attraction
of
industry
and
a
stop
to
the
piracy
of
industry
by
Southern
states
,
and
a
strong
fight
against
discrimination
in
business
and
industry
.
``
We
must
keep
the
bloodstream
of
New_Jersey
clean
''
,
the
former
Superior_Court
judge
said
.
``
To
prevent
hoodlums
from
infiltrating
the
state
as
they
did
in
the
Republican
administration
in
the
early
1940
s
''
.
Calling
the
Democrats
the
``
party
that
lives
,
breathes
and
thinks
for
the
good
of
the
people
''
,
Hughes
asked
,
``
a
representative
Democratic
vote
in
the
primary
for
a
springboard
toward
victory
in
November
''
.
Hughes
supported
Gov._Meyner
's
``
Green_Acres
''
plan
for
saving
large
tracts
of
open
land
from
the
onrush
of
urban
development
.
He
said
legislation
for
a
$
60
million
bond
issue
to
underwrite
the
program
is
expected
to
be
introduced
Monday
.
The
plan
will
provide
$
45
million
for
purchase
of
open
land
by
the
state
.
The
other
$
15
million
is
to
be
alloted
to
municipalities
on
a
matching
fund
basis
.
Hughes
said
,
``
This
is
not
a
plan
to
conquer
space
-
but
to
conserve
it
''
,
pointing_out
the
state
population
has
increased
125000
each_year
since
1950
.
He
said
``
Morris_County
is
rapidly
changing
and
unless
steps
are
taken
_to
preserve
the
green
areas
,
there
will
be
no
land
left
to
preserve
''
.
Hughes
would
not
comment
on
tax
reforms
or
other
issues
in_which
the
Republican
candidates
are
involved
.
He
said
no_matter
what
stand
he
takes
it
would
be
misconstrued
that
he
was
sympathetic
to
one
or
the
other
of
the
Republicans
.
``
After
the
primary
''
,
he
promised
,
``
I
'll
be
explicit
on
where
I
stand
to
bring
you
a
strong
,
dynamic
administration

I
'm
not
