Nick_Skorich
,
the
line_coach
for
the
football
champion
Philadelphia_Eagles
,
was
elevated
today
to
head
coach
.
Skorich
received
a
three
year
contract
at
a
salary
believed
to
be
between
$
20000
and
$
25000
a
year
.
He
succeeds
Buck_Shaw
,
who
retired
at
the
end
of
last
season
.
The
appointment
was
announced
at
a
news_conference
at
which
Skorich
said
he
would
retain
two
members
of
Shaw
's
staff
-
Jerry_Williams
and
Charlie_Gauer
.
Williams
is
a
defensive
coach
.
Gauer
works
with
the
ends
.
The
selection
had
been
expected
.
Skorich
was
considered
the
logical
choice
after
the
club
gave
Norm_Van_Brocklin
permission
to
seek
the
head
coaching_job
with
the
Minnesota_Vikings
,
the
newest
National_Football_League
entry
.
Van_Brocklin
,
the
quarterback
who
led
the
Eagles
to
the
title
,
was
signed
by
the
Vikings
last
Wednesday
.
Philadelphia
permitted
him
to
seek
a
better
connection
after
he
had
refused
to
reconsider
his
decision
to
end
his
career
as
a
player
.
With
Skorich
at
the
helm
,
the
Eagles
are
expected
to
put
more
emphasis
on
running
,
rather
than
passing
.
In
the
past
the
club
depended
largely
on
Van_Brocklin
's
aerials
.
Skorich
,
however
,
is
a
strong
advocate
of
a
balanced
attack
-
split
between
running
and
passing
.
Skorich
,
who
is
39
years
old
,
played
football
at
Cincinnati_University
and_then
had
a
three
year
professional
career
as
a
lineman
under
Jock_Sutherland
with
the
Pittsburgh_Steelers
.
An
injury
forced
Skorich
to
quit
after
the
1948
season
.
He
began
his
coaching
career
at
Pittsburgh_Central_Catholic_High_School
in
1949
.
He
remained
there
for
four
years
before
moving
to
Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute
in
Troy
,
N._Y.
.
He
was
there
one
season
before
rejoining
the
Steelers
as
an
assistant
coach
.
Four
years
later
he
resigned
to
take
a
similar
job
with
the
Green_Bay_Packers
.
The
Eagles
signed
him
for
Shaw
's
staff
in
1959
.
Skorich
began
his
new
job
auspiciously
today
.
At
a
ceremony
in
the
reception_room
of
Mayor_Richardson_Dilworth
,
the
Eagles
were
honored
for
winning
the
championship
.
Shaw
and
Skorich
headed
a
group
of
players
,
coaches
and
team
officials
who
received
an
engrossed
copy
of
an
official
city
citation
and
a
pair
of
silver
cufflinks
shaped
like
a
football
.
With
the
announcement
of
a
``
special
achievement
award
''
to
William_A._Bill_Shea
,
the
awards
list
was
completed
yesterday
for

The
53
-
year
old
Shea
,
a
prominent
corporation
lawyer
with
a
sports
background
,
is
generally
recognized
as
the
man
most
responsible_for
the
imminent
return
of
a
National_League
club
to
New_York
.
Named
by
Mayor_Wagner
three
years
ago
to
head
a
committee
that
included
James_A._Farley
,
Bernard_Gimbel
and
Clint_Blume
,
Shea
worked
relentlessly
.
His
goal
was
to
obtain
a
National_League
team
for
this
city
.
The
departure
of
the
Giants
and
the
Dodgers
to
California
left
New_York
with
only
the
Yankees
.
Despite
countless
barriers
and
disappointments
,
Shea
moved
forward
.
When
he
was
unable
to
bring_about
immediate
expansion
,
he
sought
to
convince
another
National_League
club
to
move
here
.
When
that
failed
,
he
enlisted
Branch_Rickey
's
aid
in
the
formation
of
a
third
major_league
,
the
Continental
,
with
New_York
as
the
key
franchise
.
The
Continental_League
never
got_off_the_ground
,
but
after
two
years
it
forced
the
existing
majors
to
expand
.
The
New_York
franchise
is
headed
by
Mrs._Charles_Shipman_Payson
.
A

Arnold_Palmer
has
been
a
blazing
figure
in
golf
over
the
past
twelve
months
.
He
won
the
Masters
,
the
United_States_Open
and
a
record
$
80738
in
prize_money
.
He
was
heralded
as
``
Sportsman
of
the
Year
''
by
Sports_Illustrated
,
and
last
night
was
acclaimed
in
Rochester
as
the
``
Professional_Athlete_of_the_Year
''
,
a
distinction
that
earned
for
him
the
$
10000
diamond
-
studded
Hickok_Belt
.
But
he
also
achieved
something
that
endeared
him
to
every
duffer
who
ever
flubbed
a
shot
.
A_couple_of
weeks
ago
,
he
scored
a
monstrous
12
on
a
par
5
hole
.
It
made
him
human
.
And
it
also
stayed
the
hands
of
thousands
of
brooding
incompetents
who
were
meditating
the
abandonment
of
a
sport
whose
frustrations
were
driving
them
to
despair
.
If
such
a
paragon
of
perfection
as
Palmer
could
commit
such
a
scoring
sacrilege
,
there
was
hope
left
for
all
.
It
was
neither
a
spirit
of
self-sacrifice
nor
a
yen
to
encourage
the
downtrodden
that
motivated
Arnold
.
He
merely
became
victimized
by
a
form
of
athletics
that
respects
no
one
and
aggravates
all
.
The
world
's
best
golfer
,
shooting
below
par
,
came
to
the
last
hole
of
the
opening
round
of
the
Los_Angeles_open
with
every
intention
of
delivering
a
final
crusher
.
He
boomed
a
280
-
yard
drive
.
Then
the
pixies
and
the
zombies
took_over
while
the
banshees
wailed
in
the
distance
.
On
the
narrow
fairway
of
a
508
-
yard
hole
,
Arnold
whipped
into
his
second
shot
.
The
ball
went
off
in
a
majestic
arc
,
an
out-of-bounds
slice
.
He
tried
again
and
once_more
sliced
out_of_bounds
.
He
hooked
the
next
two
out_of_bounds
on
the
opposite
side
.
``
It
is
possible
that
I
over
corrected
''
,
he
said
ruefully
.
Each
of
the
four
wayward
shots
cost
him
two
strokes
.
So
he
wound_up
with
a
dozen
.
``
It
was
a
nice
round
figure
,
that
12
''
,
he
said
as
he
headed
for
the
clubhouse
,
not
too_much
perturbed
.
From
the
standpoint
of
the
army
of
duffers
,
however
,
this
was
easily
the
most
heartening
exhibition
they
had
had
since
Ben_Hogan
fell
upon
evil
ways
during
his
heyday
and
scored
an
11
in
the
Texas_open
.
The
idol
of
the
hackers
,
of_course
,
is
Ray_Ainsley
,
who
achieved
a
19
in
the
United_States_Open
.
Their
secondary
hero
is
another
pro
,
Willie_Chisholm
,
who
drank
his
lunch
during
another
Open
and
tried
to
blast
his
way
out
of
a
rock
strewn
gully
.
Willie
's
partner
was
Long_Jim_Barnes
,
who
tried
to
keep
count
.
``
How
many
is
that
,
Jim
''
?
asked
Willie
at
one
stage
of
his
excavation
project
.
``
Thirteen
''
,
said
Long_Jim
.
``
Nae
,
man
''
,
said
Willie
,
``
ye
must
be
countin
'
the
echoes
''
.
He
had
a
16
.
Palmer
's
dozen
were
honestly
earned
.
Nor
were
there
any
rules
to
save
him
.
If
there
had
been
,
he
would
have
found
a
loophole
,
because
Arnold
is
one
golfer
who
knows
the
code
as
thoroughly
as
the
man
who
wrote
the
book
.
This
knowledge
has
come_in_handy
,
too
.
His
first
shot
in
the
Open
last
year
landed
in
a
brook
that
flowed
along
the
right
side
of
the
fairway
.
The
ball
floated
downstream
.
A
spectator
picked_up
the
ball
and
handed
it
to
a
small
boy
,
who
dropped
this
suddenly
hot_potato
in
a
very
playable
lie
.
Arnold
sent_for
Joe_Dey
,
the
executive_secretary
of
the
golf
association
.
Joe
naturally
ruled
that
a
ball
be
dropped
from
alongside
the
spot
where
it
had
originally
entered
the
stream
.
``
I
knew
it
all_along
''
,
confessed
Arnold
with
a
grin
,
``
but
I
just
happened
to
think
how
much
nicer
it
would
be
to
drop
one
way
up
there
''
.
For
a
serious
young_man
who
plays
golf
with
a
serious
intensity
,
Palmer
has
such
an
inherent
sense_of_humor
that
it
relieves
the
strain
and
keeps
his
nerves
from
jangling
like
banjo
strings
.
Yet
he
remains
the
fiercest
of
competitors
.
He
'll
even
bull
head-on
into
the
rules
when
he
is
sure
he
's
right
.
That
's
how
he
first
won
the
Masters
in
1958
.
It
happened
on
the
twelfth
hole
,
a
155
-
yarder
.
Arnold
's
iron
shot
from
the
tee
burrowed
into
the
bunker
guarding
the
green
,
an
embankment
that
had
become
soft
and
spongy
from
the
rains
,
thereby
bringing
local
rules
into
force
.
``
I
can
remove
the
ball
,
can't
I
''
?
asked
Palmer
of
an
official
.
``
No
''
,
said
the
official
.
``
You
must
play
it
where
it
lies
''
.
``
You
're
wrong
''
,
said
Arnold
,
a
man
who
knows
the
rules
.
``
I
'll
do
as
you
say
,
but
I
'll
also
play
a
provisional
ball
and
get
a
ruling
''
.
He
scored
a
4
for
the
embedded
ball
,
a
3
with
the
provisional
one
.
The
golfing
fathers
ruled_in
his
favor
.
So
he
picked_up
a
stroke
with
the
provisional
ball
and
won
the
tournament
by
the
margin
of
that
stroke
.
Until
a_few
weeks
ago
,
however
,
Arnold_Palmer
was
some
god-like
creature
who
had
nothing
in_common
with
the
duffers
.
But
after
that
12
at
Los_Angeles
he
became
one_of_the_boys
,
a
bigger
hero
than
he
ever
had
been
before
.
A
formula
to
supply
players
for
the
new
Minneapolis_Vikings
and
the
problem
of
increasing
the
1961
schedule
to
fourteen
games
will
be
discussed
by
National_Football_League
owners
at
a
meeting
at
the
Hotel_Warwick
today
.
Other
items
on
the
agenda
during
the
meetings
,
which
are
expected
to
continue
through
Saturday
,
concern
television
,
rules
changes
,
professional
football
's
hall_of_fame
,
players
'
benefits
and
constitutional
amendments
.
The
owners
would_like
each
club
in
the
fourteen
team
league
to
play
a
home
and
home
series
with
teams
in
its
division
,
plus
two
games
against
teams
in
the
other
division
.
However
,
this
would
require
a
lengthening
of
the
season
from
thirteen
to
fourteen
weeks
.
Pete_Rozelle
,
the
league
commissioner
,
pointed_out
:
``
We
'll
have
the
problem
of
baseball
at
one
end
and
weather
at
the
other
''
.
Nine
of
the
league
's
teams
play
in
baseball
parks
and
therefore
face
an
early
season
conflict
in
dates
.
