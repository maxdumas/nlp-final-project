Then
he
turned
the
telephone
over
to
Rourke
,
and
went_into
the
bedroom
to
change
his
slippers
for
dry
socks
and
shoes
.
Rourke
was
talking
on
the
phone
when
he
came_back
.
``
About
an
hour
,
eh
?
Are
you
positive
''
?
He
listened
a
moment
and_then
said
,
``
Hold_it
''
.
He
turned
his
head
and
said
,
``
Alvarez
will
definitely
be
in
a
back_room
at
the
Jai_Alai
Club
on
South_Beach
within
an
hour
.
Want
to
try
and
meet
him
there
''
?
Shayne
looked
at
his
watch
.
That
was
n't
too
far
from
Fifth_Street
,
and
should
allow
him
to
make
Scotty
's
Bar
by
midnight
.
He
said
with
satisfaction
,
``
That
's
fine
,
Tim
.
I
'll
be
there
''
.
Rourke
confirmed
the
appointment
over
the
phone
and
hung_up
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
're
getting_into
,
Mike
''
,
he
said
unhappily
.
``
I
hope
to
Christ
''
.
Shayne
said
briskly
,
``
Grab
another
drink
if
you
want
it
.
We
've
got
one
other
call
to
make
before
I
meet
Alvarez
''
.
``
Where
''
?
``
It
's
out
in
the
Northeast
section
.
Have
you
got
my
car
here
''
?
``
It
's
parked
in_front
''
.
Rourke
hastily
slopped
whiskey
into
his
glass
on
top
of
half-melted
ice-cubes
.
``
I
'd
better
keep_on
driving
yours
''
,
Shayne
decided
,
``
because
I
'll
be
going_on
over
to
the
Beach
.
I
can
drop
you
back
here
to
pick
mine
up
''
.
He
went_to
a
closet
to
get
a
light
jacket
,
and
took
his
hat
from
beside
the
door
.
Timothy_Rourke
gulped
down
the
whiskey
hastily
and
joined
him
,
asking
,
``
Who
are
we
going_to
call
on
in
the
Northeast
section
''
?
``
A
lady
.
That_is
,
maybe
not
too_much
of
a
lady
.
At_least
,
I
want
to
find_out
whether
she
's
home
yet
or
not
''
.
He
opened
the
door
and
followed
Rourke
out
.
In
Rourke
's
car
,
Shayne
drove
east
to
Biscayne_Boulevard
and
north
toward
Felice_Perrin
's
address
which
had
been
given
to
him
by
the
Peralta
governess
.
As
he
drove
,
he
filled_in
Timothy_Rourke
briefly
on
the
events
of
the
evening
after
leaving
the
reporter
to
go_to
the
Peralta
house
,
and
on_his_own
surmises
.
``
I
want
to
be
in
Scotty
's
Bar
at
midnight
when
Marsha
makes
her
phone_call
there
''
,
he
ended
grimly
.
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
that
threatening
letter
of
hers
has
anything
to
do
with
this
situation
or
not
,
but
I
want
to
see
who
takes
the
call
''
.
``
This
deal
at
Las_Putas_Buenas
where
the
two
knife-men
jumped
you
''
,
said
Rourke
with
interest
,
``
that
sounds
like
it
was
set_up
with
malice
aforethought
by
the
luscious
Mrs._Peralta
,
does
n't
it
''
?
``
It
does
''
,
Shayne
grunted
sourly
,
still
able
to
taste
her
mouth
on
his
in
the
Green_Jungle
parking_lot
.
``
That
story
of
hers
about
an
unsigned
note
directing
her
to
be
there
tonight
sounds
completely
phony
.
If
it
was
designed
to
put
me
on_the_spot
,
it
would
have_to
have
been
written
before
Peralta
ever
called
me
in
on
the
case
''
.
``
Do
you
think
Laura
did
have
the
counterfeit
bracelet
made
without
her
husband
's
knowledge
''
?
``
I
have
n't
the
faintest
idea
.
I
think
her
husband
strongly
suspects
so
,
and
that
's
why
he
called
me
in
on
the
thing
in
direct
defiance
of
his
confederates
and
almost
certainly
without
telling
them
why
he
was
doing
so
.
Is
n't
this
Felice
's
street
''
?
Shayne
asked
,
peering
ahead
at
the
partially
obscured
street_sign
.
Rourke
could
see
it
better
out
the
right-hand
side
,
and
he
said
,
``
Yes
.
Turn
to
the
left
,
I
think
,
for
that
number
you
gave
me
.
Not
more_than
a
block
or_so
''
.
Shayne
got_in
the
left-hand
lane
and
cut_across
the
Boulevard
divider
.
There
was
a
small
,
neon-lighted
restaurant
and
cocktail_lounge
on
the
southeast
corner
of
the
intersection
as
he
turned
into
the
quiet
,
palm-lined
street
where
most_of
the
houses
on
both
sides
were
older
two-story
mansions
,
now
cut_up
into
furnished
rooms
and
housekeeping
apartments
.
Shayne
drove
westward
from
the
Boulevard
slowly
,
letting
Rourke
crane
his
head
out
the
window
and
watch
for
street
numbers
.
A
single
automobile
was
parked
half-way
up
the
block
on
the
left-hand
side
.
Shayne
noted
idly
that
it
carried
Miami_Beach
license_plates
as
he
approached
,
and_then
saw
the
flare
of
a
match
in
the
front
seat
as
they
passed
,
indicating
that
it
was
occupied
.
He
turned
to
see
the
briefly-illumed
faces
of
two
men
in
the
parked
car
just_as
Rourke
said
,
``
It
's
the
next
house
,
Mike
.
On_the_right
''
.
Instead
of
pulling
into
the
curb
,
Shayne
increased
his
speed
slightly
to
the
corner
where
he
swung
left
.
He
went
around
the
corner
and
parked
,
turning_off
his
lights
and
motor
.
``
I
told
you
,
Mike
''
,
said
Rourke
in
an
aggrieved
voice
.
``
It
was
back
there
''
.
Shayne
said
,
``
I
know
it
was
,
Tim
''
.
His
voice
was
chilling
and
cold
.
``
Did
you
see
the
car
parked
across
the
street
''
?
``
I
did
n't
notice
it
.
I
was
watching
for
numbers
''
.
``
It
has
a
Beach
license
,
Tim
.
Two
men
in
the
front
seat
.
I
got
a
quick
look
at
their
faces
as
we
went_past
.
Unless
I
'm
crazy
as
hell
,
they
're
two
of
Painter
's
dicks
.
A
couple
named
Harris
and
Geely
.
Those
names
mean
anything
to
you
''
?
``
Wait
a
minute
,
Mike
.
In
Painter
's
office
this_evening
''
.
Shayne
nodded
grimly
.
``
The
pair
whom
Petey
is
officially
commending
for
slapping
me
around
and
pulling
me
in
''
.
``
What
are
they
doing
here
''
?
``
A
stake-out
,
I
suppose
.
On
Felice_Perrin
.
Maybe
with
specific
orders
to
see
that
I
do
n't
make
contact
with
her
.
I
'm
not
positive
,
Tim
.
I
may
be
wrong
.
I
'll
slide
out
and
walk_around
the
block
back
to
the
cocktail_lounge
on
Biscayne
.
You
drive
on
and
circle
back
and
pull_up
beside
them
parked
there
.
You
're
a
reporter
,
and
you
're
looking_for
Miss_Perrin
to
interview
her
.
Make
them
show
their
hands
.
If
they
are
Beach
cops
on
a
stake-out
,
they
'll
admit
it
to
a
reporter
.
They
've
got
no
official
standing
on
this
side
of
the
Bay
.
As
soon
as
you
find_out
if
they
are
Geely
and
Harris
,
come
on
around
to
the
lounge
where
I
'll
be
waiting
''
.
Shayne
opened
the
door
on
his
side
and
stepped_out
.
Timothy_Rourke
groaned
dismally
as
he
slid
under
the
wheel
.
``
The
things
you
talk
me
into
,
Mike
''
.
Shayne
chuckled
.
``
How
often
do
they
add_up
to
headlines
?
You
should
complain
''
.
He
crossed
the
street
and
walked
swiftly
southward
to
circle
back
to
the
Boulevard
and
north
a
block
to
the
open
restaurant
.
He
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
bar
enjoying
a
slug
of
cognac
when
Rourke
came_in
six
or
eight
minutes
later
.
The
reporter
nodded
as
he
moved
up
beside
him
at
the
bar
.
Shayne
told
the
bartender
,
``
Bourbon
and
water
''
,
and
Rourke
told
him
,
``
It
's
those
two
,
all_right
.
Harris
and
Geely
.
I
made
them
show
me
their
identification
before
I
could
be
persuaded
not
to
call
on
Felice_Perrin
''
.
Shayne
said
happily
,
``
I
've
got
it
all
worked_out
,
Tim
.
Take
your
time
with
your
drink
.
I
'll
beat_it
.
In
exactly
three
minutes
,
go_in
that
phone_booth
behind
you
and
call
Police_Headquarters
.
Be
excited
and
do
n't
identify
yourself
.
Just
say
that
a_couple_of
drunks
are
having
a
hell
of
a
fight
down
the
street
,
and
they
better
send
a
patrol_car
.
Then
hang_up
fast
and
come
walking
on
down
to
the
Perrin
address
.
I
'll
be
waiting
for
you
there
''
.
The
bartender
brought
Rourke
's
drink
and
Shayne
laid
a
twenty-dollar
bill
on
the
bar
.
He
said
in_a_low_voice
,
``
I
've
got
a
date
with
a
lady
,
Mister
.
Will
that
pay
for
a
pint
I
can
take
with
me
.
You
know
how
it
is
''
,
he
added
with
a
conspiratorial
wink
.
``
Candy
is
dandy
,
but
liquor
is
quicker
and
you
do
n't
have
any
candy
for_sale
here
anyhow
''
.
``
We
sure
do
n't
''
.
The
bartender
winked
back
at
him
and
palmed
the
bill
.
He
turned_away
and
returned
in_a_moment
with
a
pint
of
brandy
in
a
small
paper
sack
which
he
slid
over
the
counter
to
Shayne
.
As
the
detective
slid
it
into
his
pocket
,
Rourke
asked
sadly
,
``
What
in
hell
are
you
going_to
do
,
Mike
''
?
``
Make
a_couple_of
punk
detectives
named
Geely
and
Harris
wish
to
God
they
'd
stayed
out
of
my
way
this
afternoon
.
Three
minutes
,
Tim
''
.
Shayne
strode
out
blithely
,
and
Rourke
checked
his
watch
and
sipped
his
drink
,
getting
a
dime
ready_to
make
the
telephone_call
to
the
police
.
Outside
,
Shayne
hesitated
when
he
saw
that
Rourke
had
parked
his
coupe
directly
in_front
of
the
bar
headed
south
.
He
walked
over
to
the
right-hand
door
,
opened
it
and
got
the
reloaded
automatic
out
of
the
glove_compartment
and
put
it
in
his
hip_pocket
.
He
hoped
he
would
n't
be
forced
to
use
it
in
taking_care
of
the
Beach
detectives
,
but
its
weight
was
comforting
at
his
hip
.
On
this
side
of
the
Bay
,
Miami_Beach
cops
had
no_more
legal_rights
than
any
ordinary
citizen
,
and
Shayne
's
pistol
permit
was
just_as
good
as
theirs
.
He
went
swiftly
up
the
sidewalk
toward
the
parked
car
with
the
two
Beach
detectives
in
the
front
seat
.
He
tugged
the
brim
of
his
hat
low
as
he
approached
,
stepped
out
into
the
street
just
behind
the
car
and
strode
around
to
the
right-hand
side
.
The
big
,
paunchy
man
named
Geely
was
on
that
side
,
half-turned
in
the
seat
toward
his
hatchet-faced
companion
so_that
his
back
partially
rested
against
the
closed
door
.
Shayne
turned
the
handle
and
jerked
the
door
open
before
either
of
the
men
were
quite
aware_of
his
presence
in
the
night
.
Geely
grunted
and
slid
partly
out
,
and
Shayne
's
left
arm
snaked
in
around
his
neck
to
help
him
,
while
he
set
himself
solidly
on
the
roadway
and
swung
his
right
fist
to
the
big
,
gum-chewing
jaw
before
Geely
could
straighten_up
.
Shayne
stepped
back
to
let
him
slump
to
the
ground
,
and_then
dived
over
him
through
the
open_door
into
Harris
who
was
cursing
loudly
and
trying
to
drag
a
gun
from
a
shoulder_holster
,
somewhat
impeded
by
the
steering_wheel
.
Shayne
locked
his
big_hands
around
Harris
'
thin
neck
and
dragged
him
out
over
the
seat
into
the
roadway
.
He
hit
him
once
on
the
sharp
point
of
his
chin
and
felt
the
body
go
limp
.
He
dropped
him
into
the
street
a_couple_of
feet
away
from
Geely
's
recumbent
figure
and
stared
down
at
both
of
them
for
a
moment
before
kicking
the
big
man
lightly
in
the
side
.
He
did
n't
stir
.
They
were
both
breathing
heavily
,
out_cold
,
and
Shayne
did
n't
think
either
of
them
had
recognized
him
or
could
describe
him
.
He
got
the
pint
of
liquor
out
of
his
pocket
and
unscrewed
the
top
,
sprinkled
the
pungent
stuff
liberally
over
both
men
,
and_then
tossed
the
open
bottle
in
on
the
front
seat
.
He
turned
,
then
,
to
look
toward
the
lighted
Boulevard
,
and
saw
Rourke
's
tall
,
emaciated
figure
come_out
of
the
lounge
and
hurriedly
start
to
angle
across
the
street
toward
the
opposite
side
.
Shayne
strolled
across
to
intercept
the
reporter
in_front
of
the
two-story
house
where
Felice_Perrin
lived
,
and
asked
casually
,
``
Get
the
police
okay
''
?
``
Sure
.
Said
they
'd
have
a
patrol_car
here
fast
.
Let
's
get
inside
.
What
happened
with
you
''
?
``
Why
the
two
damned
fools
got
all
excited
when
they
saw
the
bottle
,
and
knocked
each
other
out_cold
''
,
Shayne
said
good-humoredly
.
``
They
'll
have
fun
explaining
that
to
the
Miami
cops
.
Got
no
business
over_here
on
a
stake-out
anyway
''
.
They
went_up
onto
a
front_porch
and
into
a
small
hallway
where
a
dim
bulb
burned
high
in
the
ceiling
.
A
row
of
mailboxes
along
the
wall
had
numbers
and
names
on
them
.
Shayne
found
one
marked
PERRIN
2
-
A
.
The
stairway
on_the_right
was
dark
,
but
there
was
a
wall-switch
at
the
bottom
which
lighted
another
dim
bulb
at
the
top
,
and
they
went_up
.
There
were
two
front_rooms
,
both
dark
behind
their
transoms
,
and
there
was
no
sound
or
light
in
the
entire
house
to
indicate
that
any
of
the
occupants
were
awake
.
