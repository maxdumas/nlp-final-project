(
Los_Angeles
in
1957
finally
bowed
to
the
skyscraper
.
)
And
without
high
density
in
the
core
,
rapid-transit
systems
cannot
be
maintained
economically
,
let_alone
built
from_scratch
at
today
's
prices
.
However
,
the
building
of
freeways
and
garages
cannot
continue
forever
.
The
new
interchange
among
the
four
Los_Angeles
freeways
,
including
the
grade-constructed
accesses
,
occupies
by
itself
no
less
than
eighty
acres
of
downtown
land
,
one-eighth
of
a
square_mile
,
an
area
about
the
size
of
Rockefeller_Center
in
New_York
.
It
is
hard
to
believe
that
this
mass
of
intertwined
concrete
constitutes
what
the
law
calls
``
the
highest
and
best
use
''
of
centrally
located
urban
land
.
As
it
affects
the
city
's
fiscal
situation
,
such
an
interchange
is
ruinous
;
it
removes
forever
from
the
tax
rolls
property
which
should
be
taxed
to
pay
for
the
city
services
.
Subways
improved
land
values
without
taking_away
land
;
freeways
boost
valuation
less
(
because
the
garages
they
require
are
not
prime
buildings
by_a_long_shot
)
,
and
reduce
the
acreage
that
can
be
taxed
.
Downtown
Los_Angeles
is
already
two-thirds
freeway
,
interchange
,
street
,
parking_lot
and
garage
-
one
of
those
preposterous
``
if
''
statistics
has
already
come
to
pass
.
The
freeway
with
narrowly
spaced
interchanges
concentrates
and
mitigates
the
access
problem
,
but
it
also
acts
inevitably
as
an
artificial
,
isolating
boundary
.
City
planners
do
not
always
use
this
boundary
as
effectively
as
they
might
.
Less
ambitious
freeway
plans
may
be
more
successful
-
especially
when
the
roadways
and
interchanges
are
raised
,
allowing_for
cross
access
at
many
points
and
providing
parking_areas
below
the
ramp
.
Meanwhile
,
the
automobile
and
its
friend
the
truck
have
cost
the
central_city
some
of
its
industrial
dominance
.
In
ever
greater
numbers
,
factories
are
locating
in
the
suburbs
or
in
``
industrial_parks
''
removed
from
the
city
's
political
jurisdiction
.
The
appeal
of
the
suburb
is
particularly
strong
for
heavy
industry
,
which
must
move
bulky
objects
along
a
lengthy
assembly_line
and
wants
enough
land_area
to
do
the
entire
job
on
one
floor
.
To
light
industry
,
the
economies
of
being
on
one
floor
are
much
slighter
,
but
efficiency_engineers
usually
believe_in
them
,
and
manufacturers
looking_for
ways
to
cut
costs
cannot
be
prevented
from
turning_to
efficiency_engineers
.
This
movement
of
industry
away
from
the
central_cities
is
not
so
catastrophically
new
as
some
prophets
seem
to
believe
.
It
is
merely
the
latest
example
of
the
leapfrog
growth
which
formed
the
pattern
of
virtually
all
American
cities
.
The
big
factories
which
are
relatively
near
the
centers
of
our
cities
-
the
rubber
factories
in
Akron
,
Chrysler
's
Detroit
plants
,
U._S._Steel
's
Pittsburgh
works
-
often
began
on
these
sites
at_a_time
when
that
was
the
edge
of
the
city
,
yet
close
to
transport
(
river
)
,
storage
(
piers
)
and
power
(
river
)
.
The
``
leapfrog
''
was
a
phenomenon
of
the
railroad
and
the
steam_turbine
,
and
the
time
when
the
belts
of
residence
surrounding
the
old
factory
area
were
not_yet
blighted
.
The
truck
and
the
car
gave
the
manufacturer
a
new
degree_of_freedom
in
selecting
his
plant
site
.
Until
internal_combustion
became
cheap
,
he
had_to
be
near
a
railroad_siding
and
a
trolley_line
or
an
existing
large
community
of
lower-class
homes
.
The
railroad_siding
is
still
important
-
it
is
usually
,
though
not
always
,
true
that
long-haul
shipment
by
rail
is
cheaper
than
trucking
.
But
anybody
who
promises
a
substantial
volume
of
business
can
get
a
railroad
to
run
a
short
spur
to
his
plant
these
days
,
and
many
businesses
can
live
without
the
railroad
.
And
there
are
now
many
millions
of
workers
for
whom
the
factory
with
the
big
parking_lot
,
which
can
be
reached
by
driving
across
or
against
the
usual
pattern
of
rush_hour
traffic
and
grille
route
bus_lines
,
is
actually
more
convenient
than
the
walk-to
factory
.
Willow_Run
,
General_Electric
's
enormous
installations
at
Louisville
and
Syracuse
,
the
Pentagon
,
Boeing
in
Seattle
,
Douglas
and
Lockheed
in
Los_Angeles
,
the
new
automobile
assembly
plants
everywhere
-
none
of
these
is
substantially
served
by
any
sort
of
conventional
mass_rapid_transit
.
They
are
all
suburban
plants
,
relying_on
the
roads
to
keep
them
supplied
with
workers
.
And
wherever
the
new
thruways
go_up
their
banks
are
lined
by
neat
glass
and
metal
and
colored
brick
light
industry
.
The
drive
along
Massachusetts
'
Route_128
,
the
by-pass
which
makes
an
arc
about
twenty
miles
from
downtown
Boston
,
may
be
a
vision
of
the
future
.
The
future
could
be
worse
.
The
plants
along
Route_128
are
mostly
well
designed
and
nicely
set
against
the
New_England
rocks
and
trees
.
They
can
even
be
rather
grand
,
like
Edward_Land
's
monument
to
the
astonishing
success
of
Polaroid
.
But
they
deny
the
values
of
the
city
-
the
crowded
,
competitive
,
tolerant
city
,
the
``
melting_pot
''
which
gave_off
so
many
of
the
most
admirable
American
qualities
.
They
are
segregated
businesses
,
combining
again
on
one
site
the
factory
and
the
office
,
drawing
their
work_force
from
segregated
communities
.
It
is
interesting
to
note
how
many
of
the
plants
on
Massachusetts
'
Route_128
draw
most
of
their
income
either
from
the
government
in
non-competitive
cost-plus
arrangements
,
or
from
the
exploitation
of
patents
which
grant
at_least
a
partial
monopoly
.
While
the
factories
were
always
the
center
of
the
labor_market
,
they
were
often
on
the
city
's
periphery
.
In
spreading
the
factories
even
farther
,
the
automobile
may
not
have
changed
to
any
great
extent
the
growth
pattern
of
the
cities
.
Even
the
loss
of
hotel
business
to
the
outskirt
's
motel
has
been
relatively
painless
;
the
hotel-motel
demarcation
is
becoming
harder
to
find
every_year
.
What
hurts
most
is
the
damage
the
automobile
has
done
to
central-city
retailing
,
especially
in
those
cities
where
public_transit
is
feeble
.
Some
retailing
,
of_course
,
always
spreads
with
the
population
-
grocery_stores
,
drugstores
,
local
haberdasheries
and
dress_shops
,
candy_stores
and
the_like
.
But
whenever
a
major
purchase
was
contemplated
forty
years
ago
-
a
new
bedroom_set
or
a
winter
coat
,
an
Easter
bonnet
,
a
bicycle
for
Junior
-
the
family
set_off
for
the
downtown
department_store
,
where
the
selection
would
be
greatest
.
Department_stores
congregated
in
the
``
one_hundred
per_cent
location
''
,
where
all
the
transit_lines
converged
.
These
stores
are
still
there
,
but
the
volume
of
the
``
downtown
store
''
has
been
on
a
relative
decline
,
while
in
many
cities
the
suburban
``
branch
''
sells
more_and_more
dry_goods
.
If
the
retailer
and
hotelman
's
downtown
unit
sales
have
been
decreasing
,
however
,
his
dollar_volume
continues
to
rise
,
and
it
is
dollars
which
you
put_in
the
bank
.
In
most
discussions
of
this
phenomenon
,
the
figures
are
substantially
inflated
.
No
suburban
shopping-center
branch
-
not
even
Hudson
's
vast
Northland
outside
Detroit
-
does
anything
like
the
unit
volume
of
business
or
carries
anything
like
the
variety
of
merchandise
to
be
found
in
the
home
store
.
Telephone_orders
distort
the
picture
:
the
suburbanite
naturally
calls
a
local
rather_than
a
central
city
number
if
both
are
listed
in
an
advertisement
,
especially
if
the
local_call
eliminates
city
sales_tax
.
The
suburban
branch
is
thereby
credited
with
a
sale
which
would
have
been
made
even
if
its
glass
doors
had
never
opened
.
Accounting
procedures
which
continue
to
charge
a
disproportionate
overhead
and
warehouse
expense
to
the
main
store
make
the
branches
seem
more
profitable
than
they
are
.
In
many
cases
that
statement
``
We
break_even
on
our
downtown
operation
and
make
money
on
our
branches
''
would
be
turned_around
if
the
cost_analysis
were
recalculated
on
terms
less
prejudicial
to
the
old
store
.
Fear
of
the
competition
-
always
a
great
motivating
force
in
the
American
economy
-
makes
retailers
who
do
not
have
suburban
operations
exaggerate
both
the
volume
and
the
profitability
of
their
rival
's
shiny
new
branches
.
The
fact
seems
to
be
that
very
many
large
branch
stores
are
uneconomical
,
that
the
choice
of
location
in
the
suburbs
is
as
important
as
it
was
downtown
,
and
that
even
highly
suburbanized
cities
will
support
only
so
many
big
branches
.
Moreover
,
the
cost
of
operations
is
always
high
in
any
new
store
,
as
the
conservative
bankers
who
act_as
controllers
for
retail
giants
are
beginning
to
discover
.
When
all
has
been
said
,
however
,
the
big
branch
store
remains
a
major
break
with
history
in
the
development
of
American
retailing
.
Just
as
the
suburban
factory
may
be
more
convenient
than
the
downtown
plant
to
the
worker
with
a
car
,
the
trip
to
the
shopping_center
may
seem
far
easier
than
to
the
downtown
department_store
,
though
both
are
the
same
distance
from
home
.
Indeed
,
there
are
some
cities
where
the
suburban
shopping
pulls
customers
who
are
geographically
much
nearer
to
downtown
.
Raymond_Vernon
reports
that
residents
of
East_St._Louis
have
been
driving
across
the
Mississippi
,
through
the
heart
of
downtown
St._Louis
and
out
to
the
western
suburbs
for
major
shopping
,
simply
because
parking
is
easier
at
the
big
branches
than
it
is
in
the
heart
of
town
.
To
the
extent
that
the
problem
is
merely
parking
,
an
aggressive
downtown
management
,
like
that
of
Lazarus_Brothers
in
Columbus
,
Ohio
,
can
fight_back
successfully
by
building
a
garage
on
the
lot
next_door
.
If
the
distant
patron
of
the
suburban
branch
has
been
frightened_away
from
downtown
by
traffic
problems
,
however
,
the
city
store
can
only
pressure
the
politicians
to
do
something
about
the
highways
or
await
the
completion
of
the
federal
highway
program
.
And
if
the
affection
for
the
suburban
branch
reflects
a
desire
to
shop
with
``
nice
people
''
,
rather
than
with
the
indiscriminate
urban
mass
which
supports
the
downtown
department_store
,
the
central
location
may
be
in
serious
trouble
.
Today
,
according_to
land
economist
Homer_Hoyt
,
shopping_centers
and
their
associated
parking_lots
cover
some
46000
acres
of
land
,
which
is
almost
exactly
the
total
land_area
in
all
the
nation
's
Central
Business_Districts
put
together
.
The
downtown
store
continues
to
offer
the
great
inducement
of
variety
,
both
within
its
gates
and
across
the
street
,
where
other
department_stores
are
immediately
convenient
for
the
shopper
who
wants
to
see
what
is
available
before
making_up_her_mind
.
If
anything
may
be
predicted
in
the
quicksilver
world
of
retailing
,
it
seems
likely
that
the
suburban
branch
will
come
to
dominate
children
's
clothing
(
taking
the
kid
downtown
is
too_much
of
a
production
)
,
household
gadgetry
and
the
discount_business
in
big-ticket
items
.
Department_stores
were
built_on
dry_goods
,
especially
ladies
'
fashions
,
and
in
this
area
,
in_the_long_run
,
the
suburban
branches
will
be
hard_put
to
compete
against
downtown
.
If
this
analysis
is
correct
,
the
suburban
branches
will
turn_out
to
be
what
management
's
cost_accountants
refuse
to
acknowledge
,
marginal
operations
rather_than
major
factors
.
Historically
in
America
the
appeal
of
cities
has
been
their
color
and
life
,
the
variety
of
experience
they
offered
.
``
How
ya
gonna
keep
'
em
down
on
the
farm
''
?
was
a
question
that
had
to
be
asked
long
before
they
saw
Paree
.
Though
Americans
usually
lived
in
groups
segregated
by
national
origin
or
religious_belief
,
they
liked
to
work
and
shop
in
the
noise
and
vitality
of
downtown
.
Only
a
radical
change
in
the
nature
of
the
population
in
the
central_city
would
be
likely
to
destroy
this
preference
-
and
we
must
now
turn
our
attention
to
the
question
of
whether
such
a
change
,
gloomily
foreseen
by
so
many
urban
diagnosticians
,
is
actually
upon
us
.
In
their
book
American_Skyline
,
Christopher_Tunnard
and
Henry_Hope_Reed
argue
that
Franklin_Roosevelt
's
New_Deal
was
what
made
the
modern
suburb
a
possibility
-
a
fine
ironical
argument
,
when
you
consider
how
suburbanites
tend
to
vote
.
The
first
superhighways
-
New_York
's
Henry_Hudson
and
Chicago
's
Lake_Shore
,
San_Francisco
's
Bay_Bridge
and
its
approaches
,
a
good
slice
of
the
Pennsylvania_Turnpike
-
were
built
as
part
of
the
federal
works_program
which
was
going_to
cure
the
depression
.
At_the_same_time
,
Roosevelt
's
Federal_Housing_Administration
,
coupled
with
Henry_Morgenthau
's
cheap-money
policy
,
permitted
ordinary
lower-middle-class
families
to
build
their
own
homes
.
Bankers
who
had
been
reluctant
to
lend
without
better
security
than
the
house
itself
got
that
security
from
the
U._S.
government
;
householders
who
had
been
unable
to
pick_up
the
burden
of
short-term
high
interest
mortgages
found
they
could
borrow
for
twenty-five
years
at
4
per_cent
,
under
government
aegis
.
