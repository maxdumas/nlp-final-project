The
flat
,
hard
cap
was
small
,
but
he
thrust
it
to_the_back
of
his
head
.
``
Tie
him
up
''
.
``
Hell
with_it
''
.
Before
they
could
guess
his
intention
Rankin
stepped
forward
and
swung
the
guard
's
own
gun
against
the
uncovered
head
,
hard
.
The
man
went_over
without
sound
,
falling
to
the
bare
floor
.
Barton
said
harshly
,
``
Why
did
you
do
that
''
?
Rankin
sneered
at
him
.
``
What
did
you
want
me
to
do
,
kiss
him
?
He
dumped
me
in
solitary
twice
''
.
Barton
caught
the
lighter
man
's
shoulder
and
swung
him
around
.
``
Let
's
get
one
thing
straight
,
you
and
me
.
The
only
reason
we
brought
you
was
to
get
Miller
out
.
If
you
ever
try
anything
without
my
orders
I
'll
kill
you
''
.
Fred_Rankin
looked
at
him
.
It
seemed
to
Barton
that
the
green
eyes
mocked
him
,
the
thin-lipped
smile
held
insolence
,
but
he
had
no
time
to
waste
now
.
``
Come_on
.
Let
's
move
''
.
They
filed_out
through
the
guard-room
door
,
into
the
paved
square
.
There
were
three
other
men
within
this
prison
whom
Barton
would
have
liked
to
liberate
,
but
they
were
in
other
cell
blocks
.
There
was
no
chance
.
They
moved
slowly
,
toward
the
main
gate
,
following
the
wall
.
There
was
no
moon
.
They
had
chosen
this_night
purposely
.
They
reached
the
guard
house
without
alerting
the
men
on
the
walls
above
,
and
Powers
slipped
through
the
door
.
Two
men
were
on_duty
inside
,
playing
pinochle
,
relaxed
.
They
looked
up
in
surprise
as
Powers
came_in
.
``
What
are
you
doing
out
of
the
block
''
?
``
It
's
Curtiss
''
,
he
said
,
naming
the
man
Rankin
had
hit
.
``
I
've
got_to
have
help
''
.
They
stared
at
him
.
The
sergeant
in
charge
climbed
to
his
feet
.
``
What
's
wrong
with
him
''
?
``
He
's
having
some
kind_of
a
fit
''
.
The
sergeant
turned
to
the
door
.
As
he
passed_through
it
Barton
shoved
his
gun
against
the
man
's
side
.
``
One
sound
and
you
're
dead
''
.
The
sergeant
froze
.
Powers
had
not
followed
.
Powers
was
covering
the
remaining
guard
.
The
man
half
reached
for
the
cord
of
the
alarm_bell
.
Powers
knocked
his
arm
aside
.
Deliberately
,
with
none
of
Rankin
's
viciousness
,
he
laid
the
barrel
of
his
gun
alongside
the
guard
's
head
.
They
were
free
.
Even
Barton
could
not_quite
believe
it
.
It
had
gone
without
a
hitch
.
They
slid
through
the
wicket
in
the
big
gate
,
ghosted
across
the
dark
ground
.
Five
minutes
later
they
reached
the
horses
.
Barton
was
relieved
to
see
that
Carl_Dill
and
Emmett_Foster
had
brought
extra
mounts
.
He
had
been
worried
that
with
Miller
and
Rankin
added
to
the
escape
party
they
would
be
short
.
No
one
hurried
.
They
walked
the
horses
,
heading
along
the
river
,
Barton
and
Emmett_Foster
in_the_lead
,
seven
men
riding
quietly
through
the
night
.
The
only
thing
which
would
have
attracted
attention
was
that
two
wore
the
uniform
of
prison_guards
,
three
the
striped
suits
of
convicts
.
Five
miles
.
In
a
small
grove
against
the
river
they
halted
,
turning
deep
into
the
protection
of
the
trees
.
Foster
had
brought
extra
clothing
also
.
A
good
man
,
Emmett
.
He
had
been
one
of
the
original
Night_Riders
,
one
who
had
escaped
the
trial
.
It
was
to
him
that
Barton
had
sent
Carl_Dill
on
Dill
's
release
from
the
prison
.
Clyde_Miller
was
crying
softly
to
himself
,
shedding
his
striped
suit
and
fumbling
into
the
nondescript
butternut
pants
,
the
worn
brown
shirt
.
Kid_Boyd
was
unusually
silent
,
Rankin
watchful
,
a_few
paces
apart
.
Barton
finished
his
dressing
and
extended
his
hand
to
Powers
.
``
I
won
n't
even
try
to
thank
you
''
.
The
ex-prison
guard
was
embarrassed
.
He
said
in
a
studied
voice
,
``
I
did
n't
do
it
for
you
.
I
did
it
for
the
valley
.
You
're
the
only
man
the
Night_Riders
will
follow
.
We
've
been
starving
and
I
do
n't
like
to
starve
''
.
Barton
turned_away
,
his
eyes
falling
upon
Rankin
beside
his
horse
.
``
Good_luck
''
.
The
murderer
lifted
his
head
.
``
Meaning
you
want
me
to
ride
out
''
?
``
You
are
n't
one
of
us
.
There
's
nothing
for
you
here
''
.
``
I
got
no
place
to
go
''
.
Barton
hesitated
.
He
did
not
trust
Rankin
,
his
violent
temper
,
his
killer
instinct
.
But
ten
years
in
prison
had
taught
him
realities
.
They
were
in
a
fight
,
outweighed
in
both
numbers
and
money
.
It
was
all_right
to
put
a
bunch
of
ranchers
onto
horses
,
to
call
them
Night_Riders
,
to
set_out
to
attack
the
largest
mining
combination
the
country
had
ever
seen
if
all
they
wanted
was
adventure
.
But
if
they
really
hoped
to
succeed
they
needed
professionals
,
men
who
knew
how
to
use
a
gun
against
men
,
who
would
match
the
killers
on
the
other
side
.
``
Your
choice
''
,
he
said
briefly
,
and
turned_to
Kid_Boyd
.
``
Bury
those
uniforms
so
they
won
n't
be
found
''
.
Then
Barton
touched
Carl_Dill
's
arm
and
moved
off
,
up
the
river
bank
.
He
wanted
a
careful
,
uninterrupted
report
from
Dill
on
the
conditions
in
the
valley
.
They
squatted
on
their
heels
in
the
deep
mud
and
Dill
found
a
cigar
in
his
breast_pocket
,
passing
it
over
silently
.
He
too
knew
the
agony
of
going
for
weeks
,
sometimes
months
without
the
solace
of
tobacco
.
Mitchell_Barton
drew_in
the
fragrance
deeply
,
letting
the
smoke
lie
warm
and
soothing
in
his
throat
for
a
moment
before
he
exhaled
.
Through
the
gloom
he
could
not
see
the
man
beside
him
clearly
but
he
knew
him
thoroughly
.
For
his
first
five
years
in
prison
,
they
had
shared
a
cell
.
Carl_Dill
was
neither
a
rancher
nor
a
valley
man
.
He
had
been
the
auditor
for
the
mining
syndicate
,
and
he
had
stolen
fifty
thousand
dollars
of
the
syndicate
's
money
.
He
had
done
time
for
the
theft
.
The
one
thing
they
had
in_common
was
their
hatred
.
Both
hated
Donald_Kruger
.
It
had
drawn
them
together
,
and
since
his
release
from
prison
Dill
had
worked
tirelessly
to
effect
this_night
's
escape
.
He
said
now
,
``
I
've
got
the
perfect
headquarters
set_up
.
The
old
Haskell
mine
''
.
Mitch_Barton
knew
the
place
.
Twenty
years
before
a
group
of
Easterners
had
bought_out
the
Haskell
claims
in
the
rocky
hills
south
of
Grass_Valley
.
They
had
spent
a_million
dollars
,
carving
in
a
road
,
putting_up
buildings
,
drilling
their
haulage
tunnel
.
Then
the
vein
had
petered_out
and
the
whole
project
had
been
abandoned
.
``
The
road
's
washed
badly
''
,
said
Dill
,
``
but
there
's
a
trail
you
can
get_over
with
a
horse
.
A
company
of
cavalry
could
n't
come_in
there
if
two
men
were
guarding
that
trail
''
.
Barton
nodded
.
``
How
do
the
valley
people
feel
''
?
``
As
mad
as
ever
.
But
Kruger
's
men
keep
them
off
balance
,
and
they
do
n't
trust
me
.
I
'm
an
outsider
.
When
they
learn
you
're
in
the
hills
though
,
they
'll
rally
,
do
n't
worry
about
that
''
.
Barton
waited
for
a
long
moment
,
then
asked
the
question
which
lay
always
uppermost
in
his
mind
.
``
My
boy
.
Did
you
find
him
''
?
Dill
was
silent
as
if
he
hated
to
answer
,
and
Barton
had
a
cold
,
sick
feeling
of
apprehension
.
``
He
's
in
Morgan
's
Ferry
''
.
Barton
half
straightened
in
surprise
.
``
What
's
he
doing
there
''
?
Again
Dill
hesitated
.
``
Dealing
faro
''
.
``
Dealing
faro
?
How_come
''
?
``
Your
sister-in-law
has
the
faro
bank
in
Cap_Ayres
'
saloon
''
.
Barton
cursed
under
his
breath
.
After
another
long
pause
he
asked
,
``
How
many
people
know
who
they
are
''
?
``
Everyone
.
Your
cousin
Finley
saw
to
that
.
He
's
quite
a
rat
,
you
know
.
He
sold_out
to
Kruger
's
men
.
He
's
informed
them
of
everything
you
've
ever
written
him
.
He
wants
your
ranch
''
.
Barton
stood_up
.
He
said
tensely
,
``
All_right
.
Let
's
go
get
the
boy
''
.
Dill
had
come_up
also
.
``
I
was
afraid
of_this
.
I
almost
did
n't
tell
you
''
.
``
If
you
had
n't
I
'd
have
killed
you
''
.
Dill
's
voice
tightened
.
``
But
you
can
n't
ride
into
the
Ferry
.
That
's
what
they
'll
expect
you
to
do
.
They
'll
be
there
waiting
for
you
.
I
understand
how
you
feel
about
the
child
''
.
``
The
hell
you
do
''
.
Barton
's
voice
was
rougher
than
Dill
had
ever
heard
it
.
``
I
never
saw
him
.
My
wife
died
in
childbirth
after
I
was
sent_away
.
``
I
can
n't
leave
him
there
.
Donald_Kruger
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
hold
him
as
hostage
,
and
I
would
n't
entrust
a
snake
to
his
tender
care
.
I
've
got_to
get
the
boy
.
Let
's
ride
''
.
Barton
's
men
cut
the
telegraph_wires
in
half_a_dozen
places
,
carrying_away
whole
sections
to
make
repairs
more
difficult
.
It
was
over
an
hour
before
their
escape
was
discovered
,
but
still
the
news
that
Barton
was
free
flashed
across
the
central
portion
of
the
state
.
It
reached
Donald_Kruger
in
his
massive
home
in
Burlingame
.
It
reached
the
mines
at
North
San_Juan
and
Bloomfield
.
It
brought
men
out_of_bed
and
sent
them
into
hurried
conferences
.
For
everyone
involved
knew
that
the
whole
valley
was
a
powder_keg
,
and
Mitchell_Barton
the
fuse
which
could
send
it
into
explosive
violence
.
Creighton_Hague
sat
in
his
office
above
the
Ione
pit
.
The
office
was
of
logs
,
four
rooms
,
each
heated
by
an
iron
stove
.
The
building
was
dwarfed
by
the
scene
outside
.
There
a
dozen
giant
monitors
played
their
seventy-five-foot
jets
of
water
against
the
huge
seam
of
tertiary
gravel
which
was
the
mountainside
.
The
gravel
was
the
bed
of
an
ancient
river
,
buckled
in
some
prehistoric
upheaval
of
earth
.
It
was
partially
cemented
by
ages
and
pressure
,
yet
it
crumpled
before
the
onslaught
of
the
powerful
streams
,
the
force
of
a_thousand
fire_hoses
,
and
with
the
gold
it
held
washed_down
through
the
long
sluices
.
A_million
dollars
'
of
gold
a
month
.
A_million
tons
of
rock
and
soil
and
brush
.
The
monitors
ran
twenty-four_hours
each_day
.
Their
roar
,
like
the
swelling
volume
of
a_hundred
tornadoes
could
be
heard
for
miles
.
Hague
,
like
all
who
worked
near
the_pits
,
was
partly
deafened
from
the
constant
assault
against
his
eardrums
.
He
was
a
big
man
,
wearing
a
neat
flannel
shirt
against
the
cold
foothill
air
.
Fat
showed
in
loose
rolls
beneath
the
shirt
.
Ten
years
older
than
Mitch_Barton
,
he
had
clawed
his
way
up
from
mucker
in
the_pits
to
manager
of
the
operation
.
He
was
proud_of
his
accomplishments
,
proud_of
his
job
,
proud
that
Donald_Kruger
and
his
associates
trusted
him
.
He
lived
and
breathed
for
the
mining_company
.
No
man
could
have
reached
his
spot
nor
held
it
without
being
ruthless
,
and
Hague
had
made
a
virtue
of
ruthlessness
all_of
his
life
.
There
came
a
ghost
of
noise
at
the
office
door
and
Hague
swung
to
see
Kodyke
in
the
entrance
from
the
outer
room
.
Hague
had
never
accustomed
himself
to
Kodyke
.
The
man
was
tall
,
thin
,
with
a
narrow
face
and
a
too-large
nose
.
The
eyes
always
held
Hague
,
eyes
of
a
dead
man
,
lidless
as
a
lizard
's
,
with
the
fixed
intensity
of
a
cobra
.
Even
Hague
was
repelled
by
the
machinelike
deadliness
that
was
Kodyke
.
He
knew
nothing
about
the
man
's
history
.
Kodyke
had
appeared
at
the
mine
one_day
bearing
a
letter
from
Kruger
.
Kodyke
was
to
head
the
dread
company
police
.
He
ran
the
change
rooms
.
He
threw_out
the
hi-graders
.
He
supervised
the
cleanups
and
handled
the
shipments
of
raw
gold
which
each_week
went_out
to
San_Francisco
.
Hague
squeezed
down
his
uneasy
dislike
.
He
pulled
open
the
top
drawer
of
his
desk
and
drew
out
a
tintype
.
``
This
is
Mitchell_Barton
.
He
broke_out
of
Folsom
last
night
.
Apparently
he
bribed
one
of
the
guards
.
We
want
him
back
there
or
we
want
him
dead
''
.
Kodyke
took
the
picture
in
a
lean
hand
,
studying
it
thoughtfully
.
``
Dangerous
''
?
``
Dangerous
,
yes
.
You
know
how
the
ranchers
in
the
valley
are
.
They
blame
us
for
all
their
troubles
.
Ten
years
ago
they
blew_up
some
of
our
ditches
.
It
cost
us
a_hundred_thousand
dollars
and
thirty
days
lost
time
to
fix
them
.
We
do
n't
want
Barton
's
Night_Riders
loose
again
''
.
The
gunman
nodded
,
slipping
the
picture
into
his
breast_pocket
,
saying
nothing
.
Normally
Hague
wasted
no
words
,
but
now
he
found
himself
unable
to
stop
their
flow
although
he
knew
Kodyke
was
aware_of
all
he
said
.
