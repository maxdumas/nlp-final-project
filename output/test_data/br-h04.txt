The
practice
of
state-owned
vehicles
for
use
of
employees
on
business
dates_back
over
forty
years
.
At_least
one
state
vehicle
was
in
existence
in
1917
.
The
state
presently
owns
389
passenger
vehicles
in
comparison
to
approximately
200
in
1940
.
The
automobile
maintenance
unit
,
or
motor_pool
,
came
into
existence
in
1942
and
has
been
responsible_for
centralized
maintenance
and
management
of
state-owned
transportation
since
that
time
.
The
motor_pool
has
made
exceptional
progress
in
automotive
management
including
establishment
of
cost
billing
systems
,
records
keeping
,
analyses
of
vehicle
use
,
and
effecting
economies
in
vehicle
operation
.
Cars
were
operated
in
1959
for
an
average
.027
per
mile
.
Purchase
of
state
vehicles
is
handled
similarly
to
all
state
purchases
.
Unit
prices
to
the
state
are
considerably
lower
than
to
the
general
public
because
of
quantity
purchases
and
no
payment
of
state
sales
or
federal
excise_taxes
.
The
legislature
's
role
in
policy
determination
concerning
state-owned
vehicles
has
been
confined
almost
exclusively
to
appropriating
funds
for
vehicles
.
The
meaningful
policies
governing
the
purchase
,
assignment
,
use
and
management
of
state
vehicles
have
been
shaped
by
the
state
's
administrative
officers
.
Meaningful
policies
include
:
(
a
)
kinds
of
cars
the
state
should
own
,
(
b
)
when
cars
should
be
traded
,
(
c
)
the
need
and
assignment
of
vehicles
,
(
d
)
use
of
cars
in
lieu
of
mileage
allowances
,
(
e
)
employees
taking
cars
home
,
and
(
f
)
need
for
liability
insurance
on
state
automobiles
.
A
review
of
these
policies
indicates
:
The
state
purchases
and
assigns
grades
of
cars
according_to_need
and
position
status
of
driver
and
use
of
vehicle
.
The
purchase
of
compact
(
economy
)
cars
is
being
made
currently
on
a
test
basis
.
Cars
are
traded
mostly
on
a
three-year
basis
in
the
interest
of
economy
.
The
factors
governing
need
and
assignment
of
cars
are
flexible
according
to
circumstances
.
Unsuccessful
efforts
have
been
made
to
replace
high
mileage
allowances
with
state
automobiles
.
It
is
reasonably
economical
for
the
state
to
have
drivers
garage
state
cars
at
their
homes
.
The
state
has
recently
undertaken
liability
insurance
for
drivers
of
state
cars
.
A
survey
of
practices
and
/
or
policies
in
other
states
concerning
assignment
and
use
of
state
automobiles
reveals
several
points
for
comparison
with
Rhode_Island
's
practices
.
Forty-seven
states
assign
or
provide
vehicles
for
employees
on
state
business
.
Two
other
states
provide
vehicles
,
but
only
with
legislative
approval
.
States
which
provide
automobiles
for
employees
assign
them
variously
to
the
agency
,
the
individual
,
or
to
a
central
pool
.
Twenty-six
states
operate
a
central
motor_pool
for
acquisition
,
allocation
and
/
or
maintenance
of
state-owned
vehicles
.
Nineteen
states
report
laws
,
policies
or
regulations
for
assigning
state
vehicles
in
lieu
of
paying
mileage
allowances
.
Of
these
states
the
average
``
change-over
''
point
(
at
which
a
car
is
substituted
for
allowances
)
is
13200
miles
per_year
.
Mileage
allowances
for
state
employees
are
of
two
types
:
(
a
)
actual
mileage
and
(
b
)
fixed
monthly
allowances
.
Actual
mileage
allowances
are
itemized
reimbursements
allowed
employees
for
the
use
of
personally-owned
vehicles
on
state
business
at
the
rate
of
.07
per
mile
.
Fixed
monthly
allowances
are
reimbursements
for
the
same
purpose
except
on
a
non-itemized
basis
.
Both
allowances
are
governed
by
conditions
and
restrictions
set_forth
in_detail
in
the
state
's
Travel
Regulations
.
Rhode_Island
's
reimburseable
rate
of
.07
per
mile
for
use
of
personally-owned
cars
compares
favorably
with
other
states
'
rates
.
The
average
of
states
'
rates
is
.076
per
mile
.
Rhode_Island
's
rate
of
.07
per
mile
is
considerably
lower
than
reimburseable
rates
in
the
federal_government
and
in
industry
nationally
which
approximate
a
.09
per
mile
average
.
Actual
mileage
allowances
are
well-administered
and
not
unduly
expensive
for
the
state
.
The
travel
regulations
,
requirements
and
procedures
governing
reimbursement
are
controlled
properly
and
not
overly
restrictive
.
Fixed
monthly
allowances
are
a
controversial
subject
.
They
have
a
great
advantage
in
ease
of
audit
time
and
payment
.
However
,
they
lend_themselves
to
abuse
and
inadequate
control
measures
.
Flat
payments
over
$
50
per
month
are
more
expensive
to
the
state
than
the
assignment
of
state-owned
vehicles
.
Travel_allowances
,
including
subsistence
,
have
been
revised
by
administrative_officials
recently
and
compare
favorably
with
other
states
'
allowances
.
With
few
exceptions
travelers
on
state
business
are
allowed
actual
travel
expenses
and
$
15
per
day
subsistence
.
Travel_allowances
are
well-regulated
and
pose
little
problem
in
administration
and
/
or
audit
control
.
It
is
difficult
to
pinpoint
the
time_of_origin
of
the
state
purchasing
automobiles
for
use
of
employees
in
Rhode_Island
.
Few
records
are
available
concerning
the
subject
prior
to
1940
.
Those
that
are
available
shed
little
light
.
The
Registry
of
Motor_Vehicles
indicates
that
at_least
one
state
automobile
was
registered
as
far
back
as
1917
.
It
should
be
enough
to
say
that
the
practice
of
the
state
buying
automobiles
is
at_least
forty
years
old
.
The
best
reason
that
can
be
advanced
for
the
state
adopting
the
practice
was
the
advent
of
expanded
highway
construction
during
the
1920
s
and
'
30
s
.
At_that_time
highway_engineers
traveled
rough
and
dirty
roads
to
accomplish
their
duties
.
Using
privately-owned
vehicles
was
a
personal
hardship
for
such
employees
,
and
the_matter
of
providing
state
transportation
was
felt
perfectly
justifiable
.
Once
the
principle
was
established
,
the
increase
in
state-owned
vehicles
came
rapidly
.
And
reasons
other_than
employee
need
contributed
to
the
growth
.
Table
1
immediately
below
shows
the
rate_of_growth
of
vehicles
and
employees
.
This
rate
of
increase
does
not
signify
anything
in
itself
.
It
does
not
indicate
loose
management
,
ineffective
controls
or
poor
policy
.
But
it
does
show
that
automobiles
have
increased
steadily
over
the
years
and
in
almost
the
same
proportion
to
the
increase
of
state
employees
.
In_the_past
twenty
years
the
ratio
of
state-owned
automobiles
per
state
employees
has
varied
from
1
to
22
then
to
1
to
23
now
.
Whether
there
were
too
few
automobiles
in
1940
or
too
many
now
is
problematical
.
The
fact
is
simply
that
state-owned
vehicles
have
remained
in
practically
the
same
proportion
as
employees
to
use
them
.
While
the
origin
of
state-owned
automobiles
may
be
obscured
,
subsequent
developments
concerning
the
assignment
,
use
,
and
management
of
state
automobiles
can
be_related
more
clearly
.
Prior
to
1942
,
automobiles
were
the
individual
responsibility
of
the
agency
to_which
assigned
.
This
responsibility
included
all
phases
of
management
.
It
embraced
determining
when
to
purchase
and
when
to
trade
vehicles
,
who
was
to
drive
,
when
and
where
repairs
were
to
be
made
,
where
gasoline
and
automobile
services
were
to
be
obtained
and
other
allied
matters
.
In
1942
,
however
,
the
nation
was
at_war
.
Gasoline
and
automobile_tires
were
rationed
commodities
.
The
state
was
confronted
with
transportation
problems
similar
to
those
of
the
individual
.
It
met
these
problems
by
the
creation
of
the
state
automobile
maintenance
unit
(
more
popularly
called
the
motor_pool
)
,
a
centralized
operation
for
the
maintenance
and
control
of
all
state
transportation
.
The
motor_pool
then
,
as
now
,
had
headquarter
facilities
in
Providence
and
other
garages
located
throughout
the
state
.
It
was
organizationally
the
responsibility
of
the
Department
of
Public_Works
and
was
financed
on
a
rotary
fund
basis
with
each
agency
of
government
contributing
to
the
pool
's
operation
.
In
1951
the
pool
's
operation
was
transferred
to
the
newly-created
Department
of
Administration
,
an
agency
established
as
the
central
staff
and
auxiliary
department
of
the
state_government
.
The
management
of
state-owned
vehicles
since
that
time
has
been
described
in
a
recent
report
in
the
following
manner
:
``
Under
this
new
management
considerable
progress
appears
to
have
been
made
.
The
agencies
of
government
are
now
billed
for
the
actual
cost
of
services
provided
to
each
passenger_car
rather_than
the
prior
uniform
charge
for
all
cars
.
Whereas
the
maintenance
rotary
fund
had
in_the_past
sustained
losses
considerably
beyond
expectations
,
the
introduction
of
the
cost-billing
system
plus
other
control
refinements
has
resulted
in
keeping
the
fund
on
a
proper
working
basis
.
One
indication
of
the
merits
of
the
new
management
is
found
in
the
fact
that
during
the
period
1951
-
1956
,
while
total
annual
mileage
put_on
the
vehicles
increased
35
%
,
the
total
maintenance
cost
increased
only
11
%
.
''
In_order_to
further
refine
the
management
of
passenger
vehicles
,
on
July_1
,
1958
,
the
actual
title
to
every
vehicle
was
transferred
,
by
Executive_Order
,
to
the
Division
of
Methods
,
Research
and
Office
Services
.
The
objective
behind
this
action
was
to
place
in
one
agency
the
responsibility
for
the
management
,
assignment
,
and
replacement
of
all
vehicles
.
(
Note
:
So_far
as
State
Police_cars
are_concerned
,
only
their
replacement
is
under
this
division
)
.
This
tied_in
closely
with
the
current
attempt
to
upgrade
state-owned
cars
to
the
extent
that
vehicles
are
not
retained
beyond
the
point
where
maintenance
costs
(
in
light
of
depreciation
)
become
excessive
.
Moreover
,
it
allows
the
present
management
to
reassign
vehicles
so_that
mileage
will
be
more
uniformly
distributed
throughout
the
fleet
;
for_example
,
if
one
driver
puts_on
22000
miles
per_year
and
another
driver
8000
miles
per_year
,
their
cars
will
be
switched
so_that
both
cars
will
have
30000
miles
after
two
years
,
rather_than
44000
miles
(
and
related
higher
maintenance
costs
)
and
16000
miles
respectively
``
.
The
motor_pool
is
a
completely
centralized
and
mechanized
operation
.
It
handles
all
types
of
vehicle
maintenance
,
but
concentrates
more
on
``
service_station
activities
''
than
on
extensive
vehicle
repairs
.
It
contracts
with
outside
repair
garages
for
much
of
the
latter
work
.
Where
the
pool
excels
is
in
its
compilation
of
maintenance
and
cost-data
studies
and
analyses
.
Pool
records
reveal
in_detail
the
cost
per
mile
and
miles_per_gallon
of
each
vehicle
,
the
miles
traveled
in
one
year
or
three
years
,
the
periods
when
vehicle
costs
become
excessive
,
and
when
cars
should
be
traded
for
sound
economies
.
From
this
,
motor_pool
personnel
develop
other
meaningful
and
related
data
.
In
1959
-
60
,
vehicles
averaged
an
operating_cost
of
.027
per
mile
.
Based
on
this
figure
and
considering
depreciation
costs
of
vehicles
,
pool
personnel
have
determined
that
travel
in_excess
of
10000
miles
annually
is
more
economical
by
state
car
than
by
payment
of
allowances
for
use
of
personally-owned
vehicles
.
They
estimate
further
that
with
sufficient
experience
and
when
cost-data
of
compact_cars
is
compiled
,
the
break-even
point
may
be
reduced
to
7500
miles
of
travel
per_year
.
Table
2
shows
operating_cost
data
of
state
vehicles
selected
at_random
.
One
matter
of
concern
to
the
complete
effectiveness
of
pool
operations
is
the
lack
of
adequate
central
garage
facilities
.
Present
pool
quarters
at
two
locations
in
Providence
are
crowded
,
antiquated
and
,
in_general
,
make_for
inefficient
operation
in_terms_of
dispersement
of
personnel
and
duplication
of
such
operational
needs
as
stock
and
repair
equipment
.
Good
facilities
would
be
a
decided
help
to
pool
operations
and
probably
reduce
vehicle
costs
even
more
.
The
purchase
of
state-owned
vehicles
is
handled
in
the
same
manner
as
all
other
purchases
of
the
state
.
Requests
are
made
by
the
motor_pool
along
with
any
necessary
cooperation
from
the
agencies
to_which
assignments
of
cars
will
be
made
.
Bids
are
evaluated
by
the
Division
of
Purchases
with
the
assistance
of
pool
staff
,
and
awards
for
the
purchase
of
the
automobiles
are
made
to
the
lowest
responsible
bidders
.
Unit
prices
for
state
vehicles
are
invariably
lower
than
to
the
general
public
.
The
reasons
are
obvious
:
(
1
)
the
state
is
buying
in
quantity
,
and
(
2
)
it
has
no
federal
excise
or
state
sales_tax
to
pay
.
Until
1958
the
state
was
also
entitled
to
a
special
type
of
manufacturers
'
discount
through
the
dealers
.
In_that
ownership
of
all
vehicles
rests
with
the
state
motor_pool
,
cars
are
paid
for
with
funds
appropriated
to
the
agencies
but
transferred
to
the
rotary
fund
mentioned
earlier
.
This
is
a
normal
governmental
procedure
which
reflects
more
accurately
cost-accounting
principles
.
The
assignment
and
use
of
vehicles
after
purchase
is
another
matter
to
be
covered
in_detail
later
.
Probably
the_most
important
of
all
matters
for
review
are
the
broad
administrative
policies
governing
the
purchase
,
assignment
,
use
,
and
management
of
state
vehicles
.
The
legislature
's
role
in
policy
determination
in_this
area
for
years
has
been
confined
almost
solely
to
the
amount
of
funds
appropriated
annually
for
the
purchase
and
operation
of
vehicles
.
The
more
meaningful
policies
have
been_left
to
the
judgment
of
the
chief
administrative
officer
of
the
state
-
the
Director
of
Administration
.
