In
1
we
investigate
a
new
series
of
line
involutions
in
a
projective
space
of
three
dimensions
over
the
field
of
complex_numbers
.
These
are
defined
by
a
simple
involutorial
transformation
of
the
points
in_which
a
general
line
meets
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
bearing
a
curve
of
symbol
*
*
f
.
Then
in
2
we
show
that
any
line
involution
with
the
properties
that
(
a
)
It
has
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
,
and
(
b
)
Its
singular
lines
form
a
complex
consisting
exclusively
of
the
lines
which
meet
a
twisted
curve
,
is
necessarily
of
the
type
discussed
in
1
.
No
generalization
of
these
results
to
spaces
of
more_than
three
dimensions
has
so_far
been
found
possible
.
Let
Q
be
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
bearing
reguli
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
,
and
let
\
g
be
a
*
*
f
curve
of
order
k
on
Q
.
A
general
line
l
meets
Q
in
two
points
,
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
,
through
each
of_which
passes
a
unique
generator
of
the
regulus
,
*
*
f
,
whose
lines
are
simple
secants
of
\
g
.
On
these
generators
let
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
be
,
respectively
,
the
harmonic
conjugates
of
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
with_respect_to
the
two
points
in_which
the
corresponding
generator
meets
\
g
.
The
line
*
*
f
is
the
image
of
l
.
Clearly
,
the
transformation
is
involutorial
.
We
observe
first
that
no
line
,
l
,
can
meet
its
image
except
at
one
of
its
intersections
with
Q
.
For
if
it
did
,
the
plane
of
l
and
l
'
would
contain
two
generators
of
*
*
f
,
which
is
impossible
.
Moreover
,
from
the
definitive
transformation
of
intercepts
on
the
generators
of
*
*
f
,
it
is
clear
that
the
only
points
of
Q
at
which
a
line
can
meets
its
image
are
the
points
of
\
g
.
Hence
the
totality
of
singular
lines
is
the
kth
order
complex
of
lines
which
meet
\
g
.
The
invariant
lines
are
the
lines
of
the
congruence
of
secants
of
\
g
,
since
each
of
these
meets
Q
in
two
points
which
are
invariant
.
The
order
of_this
congruence
is
*
*
f
,
since
*
*
f
secants
of
a
curve
of
symbol
(
a
,
b
)
on
a
quadric
surface
pass
through
an
arbitrary
point
.
The
class
of
the
congruence
is
*
*
f
,
since
an
arbitrary
plane
meets
\
g
in
k
points
.
Since
the
complex
of
singular
lines
is
of
order
k
and
since
there
is
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
,
it
follows
from
the
formula
*
*
f
that
the
order
of
the
involution
is
*
*
f
.
There
are
various
sets
of
exceptional
lines
,
or
lines
whose
images
are
not
unique
.
The_most
obvious
of
these
is
the
quadratic
complex
of
tangents
to
Q
,
each
line
of_which
is
transformed
into
the
entire
pencil
of
lines
tangent
to
Q
at
the
image
of
the
point
of
tangency
of
the
given
line
.
Thus
pencils
of
tangents
to
Q
are
transformed
into
pencils
of
tangents
.
It
is
interesting
that
a
1
:
1
correspondence
can
be
established
between
the
lines
of
two
such
pencils
,
so_that
in_a_sense
a
unique
image
can
actually
be
assigned
to
each
tangent
.
For
the
lines
of
any
plane
,
|
p
,
meeting
Q
in
a
conic
C
,
are
transformed
into
the
congruence
of
secants
of
the
curve
C
'
into
which
C
is
transformed
in
the
point
involution
on
Q
.
In_particular
,
tangents
to
C
are
transformed
into
tangents
to
C
'
.
Moreover
,
if
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
are
two
planes
intersecting
in
a
line
l
,
tangent
to
Q
at
a
point
P
,
the
two
free
intersections
of
the
image
curves
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
must
coincide
at
P
'
,
the
image
of
P
,
and
at
this
point
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
must
have
a
common
tangent
l
'
.
Hence
,
thought_of
as
a
line
in
a
particular
plane
|
p
,
any
tangent
to
Q
has
a
unique
image
and
moreover
this
image
is
the
same
for
all
planes
through
l
.
Each
generator
,
|
l
,
of
*
*
f
is
also
exceptional
,
for
each
is
transformed
into
the
entire
congruence
of
secants
of
the
curve
into
which
that
generator
is
transformed
by
the
point
involution
on
Q
.
This
curve
is
of
symbol
*
*
f
since
it
meets
|
l
,
and
hence
every
line
of
*
*
f
in
the
*
*
f
invariant
points
on
|
l
and
since
it
obviously
meets
every
line
of
*
*
f
in
a
single
point
.
The
congruence
of
its
secants
is
therefore
of
order
*
*
f
and
class
*
*
f
.
A
final
class
of
exceptional
lines
is
identifiable
from
the
following
considerations
:
Since
no
two
generators
of
*
*
f
can
intersect
,
it
follows
that
their
image
curves
can
have
no
free
intersections
.
In_other_words
,
these
curves
have
only
fixed
intersections
common
to
them
all
.
Now
the
only
way
in_which
all
curves
of
the
image
family
of
*
*
f
can
pass
through
a
fixed
point
is
to
have
a
generator
of
*
*
f
which
is
not
a
secant
but
a
tangent
of
\
g
,
for
then
any
point
on
such
a
generator
will
be
transformed
into
the
point
of
tangency
.
Since
two
curves
of
symbol
*
*
f
on
Q
intersect
in
*
*
f
points
,
it
follows
that
there
are
*
*
f
lines
of
*
*
f
which
are
tangent
to
\
g
.
Clearly
,
any
line
,
l
,
of
any
bundle
having
one
of
these
points
of
tangency
,
T
,
as
vertex
will
be
transformed
into
the
entire
pencil
having
the
image
of
the
second
intersection
of
l
and
Q
as
vertex
and
lying
in
the
plane
determined
by
the
image
point
and
the
generator
of
*
*
f
which
is
tangent
to
\
g
at
T
.
A
line
through
two
of
these
points
,
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
,
will
be
transformed
into
the
entire
bilinear
congruence
having
the
tangents
to
\
g
at
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
as
directrices
.
A
conic
,
C
,
being
a
(
1
,
1
)
curve
on
Q
,
meets
the
image
of
any
line
of
*
*
f
,
which
we
have
already
found
to
be
a
*
*
f
curve
on
Q
,
in
*
*
f
points
.
Hence
its
image
,
C
'
,
meets
any
line
of
*
*
f
in
*
*
f
points
.
Moreover
,
C
'
obviously
meets
any
line
*
*
f
in
a
single
point
.
Hence
C
'
is
a
*
*
f
curve
on
Q
.
Therefore
,
the
congruence
of
its
secants
,
that_is
the
image
of
a
general
plane
field
of
lines
,
is
of
order
*
*
f
and
class
*
*
f
.
Finally
,
the
image
of
a
general
bundle
of
lines
is
a
congruence
whose
order
is
the
order
of
the
congruence
of
invariant
lines
,
namely
*
*
f
and
whose
class
is
the
order
of
the
image
congruence
of
a
general
plane
field
of
lines
,
namely
*
*
f
.
The
preceding
observations
make
it
clear
that
there
exist
line
involutions
of
all
orders
greater
than
1
with
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
and
with
a
complex
of
singular
lines
consisting
exclusively
of
the
lines
which
meet
a
twisted
curve
\
g
.
We
now
shall
show
that
any
involution
with
these
characteristics
is
necessarily
of
the
type
we
have
just
described
.
To
do
this
we
must
first
show
that
every
line
which
meets
\
g
in
a
point
P
meets
its
image
at
P
.
To
see
this
,
consider
a
general
pencil
of
lines
containing
a
general
secant
of
\
G
.
By
(
1
)
,
the
image
of_this
pencil
is
a
ruled
surface
of
order
*
*
f
which
is
met
by
the
plane
of
the
pencil
in
a
curve
,
C
,
of
order
*
*
f
.
On
C
there
is
a
*
*
f
correspondence
in_which
the
*
*
f
points
cut
from
C
by
a
general
line
,
l
,
of
the
pencil
correspond
to
the
point_of_intersection
of
the
image
of
l
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
.
Since
C
is
rational
,
this
correspondence
has
k
coincidences
,
each
of_which
implies
a
line
of
the
pencil
which
meets
its
image
.
However
,
since
the
pencil
contains
a
secant
of
\
g
it
actually
contains
only
*
*
f
singular
lines
.
To
avoid
this
contradiction
it
is
necessary
that
C
be
composite
,
with
the
secant
of
\
g
and
a
curve
of
order
*
*
f
as
components
.
Thus
it
follows
that
the
secants
of
\
g
are
all
invariant
.
But
if
this
is
the
case
,
then
an
arbitrary
pencil
of
lines
having
a
point
,
P
,
of
\
g
as
vertex
is
transformed
into
a
ruled
surface
of
order
*
*
f
having
*
*
f
generators
concurrent
at
P
.
Since
a
ruled
surface
of
order
n
with
n
concurrent
generators
is
necessarily
a
cone
,
it
follows
finally
that
every
line
through
a
point
,
P
,
of
\
g
meets
its
image
at
P
,
as
asserted
.
Now
consider
the
transformation
of
the
lines
of
a
bundle
with
vertex
,
P
,
on
\
g
which
is
effected
by
the
involution
as_a_whole
.
From
the
preceding
remarks
,
it
is
clear
that
such
a
bundle
is
transformed
into
itself
in
an
involutorial
fashion
.
Moreover
,
in_this
involution
there
is
a
cone
of
invariant
lines
of
order
*
*
f
,
namely
the
cone
of
secants
of
\
g
which
pass
through
P
.
Hence
it
follows
that
the
involution
within
the
bundle
must
be
a
perspective
de
Jonquieres
involution
of
order
*
*
f
and
the
invariant
locus
must
have
a
multiple
line
of
multiplicity
either
*
*
f
or
*
*
f
.
The
first
possibility
requires
that
there
be
a
line
through
P
which
meets
\
g
in
*
*
f
points
;
the
second
requires
that
there
be
a
line
through
P
which
meets
\
g
in
*
*
f
points
.
In
each
case
,
lines
of
the
bundles
are
transformed
by
involutions
within
the
pencils
they
determine
with
the
multiple
secant
.
In
the
first
case
the
fixed
elements
within
each
pencil
are
the
multiple
secant
and
the
line
joining
the
vertex
,
P
,
to
the
intersection
of
\
g
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
which
does
not
lie
on
the
multiple
secant
.
In
the
second
,
the
fixed
elements
are
the
lines
which
join
the
vertex
,
P
,
to
the
two
intersections
of
\
g
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
which
do
not
lie
on
the
multiple
secant
.
The
multiple
secants
,
of_course
,
are
exceptional
and
in
each
case
are
transformed
into
cones
of
order
*
*
f
.
Observations
similar
to
these
can
be
made
at
each
point
of
\
g
.
Hence
\
g
must
have
either
a
regulus
of
*
*
f-fold
secants
or
a
regulus
of
*
*
f-fold
secants
.
Moreover
,
if
*
*
f
,
no
two
of
the
multiple
secants
can
intersect
.
For
if
such
were
the
case
,
either
the
plane
of
the
two
lines
would
meet
\
g
in
more_than
k
points
or
,
alternatively
,
the
order
of
the
image
regulus
of
the
pencil
determined
by
the
two
lines
would
be
too
high
.
But
if
no
two
lines
of
the
regulus
of
multiple
secants
of
\
g
can
intersect
,
then
the
regulus
must
be
quadratic
,
or
in_other_words
,
\
g
must
be
either
a
*
*
f
or
a
*
*
f
curve
on
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
.
We
now
observe
that
the
case
in_which
\
g
is
a
*
*
f
curve
on
a
quadric
is
impossible
if
the
complex
of
singular
lines
consists
exclusively
of
the
lines
which
meet
\
g
.
For
any
pencil
in
a
plane
containing
a
*
*
f-fold
secant
of
\
g
has
an
image
regulus
which
meets
the
plane
of
the
pencil
in
*
*
f
lines
,
namely
the
images
of
the
lines
of
the
pencil
which
pass
through
the
intersection
of
\
g
and
the
multiple
secant
,
plus
an
additional
component
to
account_for
the
intersections
of
the
images
of
the
general
lines
of
the
pencil
.
However
,
if
there
is
no
additional
complex
of
singular
lines
,
the
order
of
the
image
regulus
of
a
pencil
is
precisely
*
*
f
.
This
contradicts
the
preceding
observations
,
and
so
,
under
the
assumption
of_this
paper
we
must
reject
the
possibility
that
\
g
is
a
*
*
f
curve
on
a
quadric
surface
.
Continuing
with
the
case
in_which
\
g
is
a
*
*
f
curve
on
a
quadric
Q
,
we
first
observe
that
the
second
regulus
of
Q
consists
precisely
of
the
lines
which
join
the
two
free
intersections
of
\
g
and
the
planes
through
any
one
of
the
multiple
secants
.
For
each
of
these
lines
meets
Q
in
three
points
,
namely
two
points
on
\
g
and
one
point
on
one
of
the
multiple
secants
.
Now
consider
an
arbitrary
line
,
l
,
meeting
Q
in
two
points
,
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
.
If
|
a
is
the
multiple
secant
of
\
g
which
passes
through
*
*
f
and
|
b
is
the
simple
secant
of
\
g
which
passes
through
*
*
f
,
and
if
*
*
f
are
the
points
in_which
|
a
meets
\
g
,
and
if
*
*
f
is
the
image
of
*
*
f
on
the
generator
|
b
,
it
follows
that
the
image
of
the
line
*
*
f
is
*
*
f
.
