The
expense
and
time
involved
are
astronomical
.
However
,
we
sent
a
third
vessel
out
,
a
much
smaller
and
faster
one
than
the
first
two
.
We
have
learned
much
about
interstellar
drives
since
a_hundred
years
ago
;
that
is
all
I
can
tell
you
about
them
.
``
But
the
third
ship
came_back
several
years
ago
and
reported
&
&
&
''
.
``
That
it
had
found
a
planet
on
which
human_beings
could
live
and
which
was
already
inhabited
by
sentient
beings
''
!
said
Hal
,
forgetting
in
his
enthusiasm
that
he
had
not
been
asked
to
speak
.
Macneff
stopped
pacing
to
stare
at
Hal
with
his
pale
blue
eyes
.
``
How
did
you
know
''
?
he
said
sharply
.
``
Forgive
me
,
Sandalphon
''
,
said
Hal
.
``
But
it
was
inevitable
!
Did
not
the
Forerunner
predict
in
his
Time
and
the
World_Line
that
such
a
planet
would
be
found
?
I
believe
it
was
on
page
573
''
!
Macneff
smiled
and
said
,
``
I
am
glad
that
your
scriptural
lessons
have
left
such
an
impression
''
.
How
could
they
not
?
thought
Hal
.
Besides
,
they
were
not
the
only
impressions
.
I
still
bear
scars
on
my
back
where
Pornsen
,
my
gapt
,
whipped
me
because
I
had
not
learned
my
lessons
well
enough
.
He
was
a
good
impresser
,
that
Pornsen
.
Was
?
Is
!
As
I
grew
older
and
was
promoted
,
so
was
he
,
always
where
I
was
.
He
was
my
gapt
in
the
creche
.
He
was
the
dormitory
gapt
when
I
went_to
college
and
thought
I
was
getting_away
from
him
.
He
is
now
my
block
gapt
.
He
is
the
one
responsible_for
my
getting
such
low
M.R.
's
.
Swiftly
,
came
the
revulsion
,
the
protest
.
No
,
not
he
,
for
I
,
and
I
alone
,
am
responsible_for
whatever
happens
to
me
.
If
I
get
a
low
M._R.
,
I
do
so
because
I
want
it
that
way
or
my
dark
self
does
.
If
I
die
,
I
die
because
I
willed
it
so
.
So
,
forgive
me
,
Sigmen
,
for
the
contrary
to
reality
thoughts
!
``
Please
pardon
me
again
,
Sandalphon
''
,
said
Hal
.
``
But
did
the
expedition
find
any
records
of
the
Forerunner
having
been
on
this
planet
?
Perhaps
,
even
,
though
this
is
too_much
to
wish
,
find
the
Forerunner
himself
''
?
``
No
''
,
said
Macneff
.
``
Though
that
does
not
mean
that
there
may
not
be
such
records
there
.
The
expedition
was
under
orders
to
make
a
swift
survey
of
conditions
and_then
to
return
to
Earth
.
I
can
n't
tell
you
now
the
distance
in
light_years
or
what
star
this
was
,
though
you
can
see
it
with
the
naked
eye
at
night
in
this
hemisphere
.
If
you
volunteer
,
you
will
be
told
where
you
're
going
after
the
ship
leaves
.
And
it
leaves
very
soon
''
.
``
You
need
a
linguist
''
?
said
Hal
.
``
The
ship
is
huge
''
,
said
Macneff
,
``
but
the
number
of
military_men
and
specialists
we
are
taking
limits
the
linguists
to
one
.
We
have
considered
several
of
your
professionals
because
they
were
lamechians
and
above
suspicion
.
Unfortunately
&
&
&
''
.
Hal
waited
:
Macneff
paced
some
more
,
frowning
.
Then
,
he
said
,
``
Unfortunately
,
only
one
lamechian
linguist
exists
,
and
he
is
too
old
for
this
expedition
.
Therefore
&
&
&
''
.
``
A_thousand
pardons
''
,
said
Hal
.
``
But
I
have
just
thought_of
one
thing
.
I
am
married
''
.
``
No
problem
at_all
''
,
said
Macneff
.
``
There
will
be
no
women
aboard
the
Gabriel
.
And
,
if
a
man
is
married
,
he
will
automatically
be
given
a
divorce
''
.
Hal
gasped
,
and
he
said
,
``
A
divorce
''
?
Macneff
raised
his
hands
apologetically
and
said
,
``
You
are
horrified
,
of_course
.
But
,
from
our
reading
of
the
Western_Talmud
,
we
Urielites
believe
that
the
Forerunner
,
knowing
this
situation
would
arise
,
made
reference
to
and
provision
for
divorce
.
It
's
inevitable
in_this
case
,
for
the
couple
will
be
separated
for
,
at_the_least
,
forty
years
.
Naturally
,
he
couched
the
provision
in
obscure
language
.
In
his
great
and
glorious
wisdom
,
he
knew
that
our
enemies
the
Israelites
must
not
be
able
to
read
therein
what
we
planned
''
.
``
I
volunteer
''
,
said
Hal
.
``
Tell
me
more
,
Sandalphon
''
.
Six
months
later
,
Hal_Yarrow
stood
in
the
observation_dome
of
the
Gabriel
and
watched
the
ball
of
Earth
dwindle
above
him
.
It
was
night
on
this
hemisphere
,
but
the
light
blazed
from
the
megalopolises
of
Australia
,
Japan
,
China
,
Southeast_Asia
,
India
,
Siberia
.
Hal
,
the
linguist
,
saw
the
glittering
discs
and
necklaces
in_terms_of
the
languages
spoken
therein
.
Australia
,
the
Philippine_Islands
,
Japan
,
and
northern
China
were
inhabited
by
those
members
of
the
Haijac_Union
that
spoke
American
.
Southern_China
,
all_of
southeast
Asia
,
southern
India
and
Ceylon
,
these
states
of
the
Malay_Federation
spoke
Bazaar
.
Siberia
spoke
Icelandic
.
His
mind
turned
the
globe
swiftly
for
him
,
and
he
visualized
Africa
,
which
used
Swahili
south
of
the
Sahara_Sea
.
All_around
the
Mediterranean_Sea
,
Asia_Minor
,
northern
India
,
and
Tibet
,
Hebrew
was
the
native
tongue
.
In
southern
Europe
,
between
the
Israeli
Republics
and
the
Icelandic_speaking
peoples
of
northern
Europe
,
was
a
thin
but
long
stretch
of
territory
called
March
.
This
was
no_man's_land
,
disputed
by
the
Haijac_Union
and
the
Israeli_Republic
,
a
potential
source
of
war
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
.
Neither
nation
would
give_up
their
claim
on
it
,
yet
neither
wished
to
make
any
move
that
might
lead
to
a
second
Apocalyptic_War
.
So
,
for
all
practical
purposes
,
it
was
an
independent
nation
and
by
now
had
its
own
organized
government
(
unrecognized
outside
its
own
borders
)
.
Its
citizens
spoke
all_of
the
world
's
surviving
tongues
,
plus
a
new
one
called
Lingo
,
a
pidgin
whose
vocabulary
was
derived
from
the
other
six
and
whose
syntax
was
so
simple
it
could
be
contained
on
half
a
sheet_of_paper
.
Hal
saw
in
his
mind
the
rest
of
Earth
:
Iceland
,
Greenland
,
the
Caribbean_Islands
,
and
the
eastern
half
of
South_America
.
Here
the
peoples
spoke
the
tongue
of
Iceland
because
that
island
had
gotten_the_jump_on
the
Hawaiian
Americans
who
were
busy
resettling
North_America
and
the
western
half
of
South_America
after
the
Apocalyptic_War
.
Then
there
was
North_America
,
where
American
was
the
native
speech
of
all
except
the
twenty
descendants
of
French-Canadians
living
on
the
Hudson_Bay_Preserve
.
Hal
knew
that
when
that
side
of
Earth
rotated
into
the
night
zone
,
Sigmen_City
would
blaze_out
into
space
.
And
,
somewhere
in_that
enormous
light
,
was
his
apartment
.
But
Mary
would
soon
no_longer
be
living
there
,
for
she
would
be
notified
in
a_few
days
that
her
husband
had
died
in
an
accident
while
on
a
flight
to
Tahiti
.
She
would
weep
in_private
,
he
was
sure
,
for
she
loved
him
in
her
frigid
way
,
though
in_public
she
would
be
dry_eyed
.
Her
friends
and
professional
associates
would
sympathize_with
her
,
not
because
she
had
lost
a
beloved
husband
,
but
because
she
had
been
married
to
a
man
who
thought
unrealistically
.
If
Hal_Yarrow
had
been
killed
in
a
crash
,
he
must
have
wanted
it
that
way
.
There
was
no
such
thing
as
an
``
accident
''
.
Somehow
,
all
the
other
passengers
(
also
supposed
to
have
died
in_this
web
of
elaborate
frauds
to
cover_up
the
disappearance
of
the
personnel
of
the
Gabriel
)
had
simultaneously
``
agreed
''
to
die
.
And
,
therefore
,
being
in
disgrace
,
they
would
not
be
cremated
and
their
ashes
flung
to
the
winds
in
public
ceremony
.
No
,
the
fish
could
eat
their
bodies
for
all
the
Sturch
cared
.
Hal
felt
sorry_for
Mary
;
he
had_a_time
keeping
the
tears
from
welling
to
his
own
eyes
as
he
stood
in
the
crowd
in
the
observation_dome
.
Yet
,
he
told
himself
,
this
was
the
best
way
.
He
and
Mary
would
no_longer
have
to
tear
and
rend
at
each
other
;
their
mutual
torture
would
be
over
.
Mary
was
free
to
marry
again
,
not
knowing
that
the
Sturch
had
secretly
given
her
a
divorce
,
thinking
that
death
had
dissolved
her
marriage
.
She
would
have
a
year
in
which
to
make_up
her
mind
,
to
choose
a
mate
from
a
list
selected
by
her
gapt
.
Perhaps
,
the
psychological
barriers
that
had
prevented
her
from
conceiving
Hal
's
child
would
no_longer
be
present
.
Perhaps
.
Hal
doubted
if
this
happy
event
would
occur
.
Mary
was
as
frozen
below
the
navel
as
he
.
No_matter
who
the
candidate
for
marriage
selected
by
the
gapt
.
The
gapt
.
Pornsen
.
He
would
no_longer
have
to
see
that
fat
face
,
hear
that
whining
voice
.
``
Hal_Yarrow
''
!
said
the
whining
voice
.
And
,
slowly
,
feeling
himself
icy
yet
burning
,
Hal
turned
.
There
was
the
squat
loose_jowled
man
,
smiling
lopsidedly
up
at
him
.
``
My
beloved
ward
,
my
perennial
gadfly
''
,
said
the
whining
voice
.
``
I
had
no
idea
that
you
,
too
,
would
be
on
this
glorious
voyage
.
But
I
might
have
known
!
We
seem
to
be
bound
by
love
;
Sigmen
himself
must
have
foreseen
it
.
Love
to
you
,
my
ward
''
.
``
Sigmen
love
you
,
too
,
my
guardian
''
,
said
Hal
,
choking
.
``
How
wonderful
to
see
your
cherished
self
.
I
had
thought
we
would
never
again
speak_to
each
other
''
.
The
Gabriel
pointed
towards
her
destination
and
,
under
one
gee
acceleration
,
began
to
build_up
towards
her
ultimate
velocity
,
99.1
percent
of
the
speed_of_light
.
Meanwhile
,
all
the
personnel
except
those
few
needed
to
carry_out
the
performance
of
the
ship
,
went_into
the
suspensor
.
Here
they
would
lie
in
suspended_animation
for
many
years
.
Some
time
later
,
after
a
check
had
been
made
of
all
automatic
equipment
,
the
crew
would
join
the
others
.
They
would
sleep
while
the
Gabriel
's
drive
would
increase
the
acceleration
to
a
point
which
the
unfrozen
bodies
of
the
personnel
could
not
have
endured
.
Upon
reaching
the
desired
speed
,
the
automatic
equipment
would
cut_off
the
drive
,
and
the
silent
but
not
empty
vessel
would
hurl
towards
the
star
which
was
its
journey
's
end
.
Many
years
later
,
the
photon
counting
apparatus
in
the
nose
of
the
ship
would
determine
that
the
star
was
close
enough
to
actuate
deceleration
.
Again
,
a
force
too
strong
for
unfrozen
bodies
to
endure
would
be
applied
.
Then
,
after
slowing
the
vessel
considerably
,
the
drive
would
adjust
to
a
one
gee
deceleration
.
And
the
crew
would
be
automatically
brought_out
of
their
suspended_animation
.
These
members
would
then
unthaw
the
rest
of
the
personnel
.
And
,
in
the
half
year
left
before
reaching
their
destination
,
the
men
would
carry_out
whatever
preparations
were
needed
.
Hal_Yarrow
was
among
the
last
to
go_into
the
suspensor
and
among
the
first
to
come_out
.
He
had
to
study
the
recordings
of
the
language
of
the
chief
nation
of
Ozagen
,
Siddo
.
And
,
from
the
first
,
he
faced
a
difficult
task
.
The
expedition
that
had
discovered
Ozagen
had
succeeded
in
correlating
two
thousand
Siddo
words
with
an
equal
number
of
American
words
.
The
description
of
the
Siddo
syntax
was
very
restricted
.
And
,
as
Hal
found_out
,
obviously
mistaken
in
many
cases
.
This
discovery
caused
Hal
anxiety
.
His
duty
was
to
write
a
school_text
and
to
teach
the
entire
personnel
of
the
Gabriel
how
to
speak
Ozagen
.
Yet
,
if
he
used
all_of
the
little
means
at
his
disposal
,
he
would
be
instructing
his
students
wrongly
.
Moreover
,
even
getting
this
across
would
be
difficult
.
For_one_thing
,
the
organs
of
speech
of
the
Ozagen
natives
differed
somewhat
from
Earthmen
's
;
the
sounds
made
by
these
organs
were
,
therefore
,
dissimilar
.
It
was
true
that
they
could
be
approximated
,
but
would
the
Ozagenians
understand
these
approximations
?
Another
obstacle
was
the
grammatical
construction
of
Siddo
.
Consider
the
tense_system
.
Instead
of
inflecting
a
verb
or
using
an
unattached
particle
to
indicate
the
past
or
future
,
Siddo
used
an
entirely
different
word
.
Thus
,
the
masculine
animate
infinitive
dabhumaksanigalu'ahai
,
meaning
to
live
,
was
,
in
the
perfect_tense
,
ksu'u'peli'afo
,
and
,
in
the
future
,
mai'teipa
.
The
same
use
of
an
entirely
different
word
applied
for
all
the
other
tenses
.
Plus
the
fact
that
Siddo
not_only
had
the
normal
(
to
Earthmen
)
three
genders
of
masculine
,
feminine
,
and
neuter
,
but
the
two
extra
of
inanimate
and
spiritual
.
Fortunately
,
gender
was
inflected
,
though
the
expression
of
it
would
be
difficult
for
anybody
not
born
in
Siddo
.
The
system
of
indicating
gender
varied
according
to
tense
.
All
the
other
parts_of_speech
:
nouns
,
pronouns
,
adjectives
,
adverbs
,
and
conjunctions
operated
under
the
same
system
as
the
verbs
.
