She
concluded
by
asking
him
to
name
another
hour
should
this
one
be
inconvenient
.
The
fish
took
the
bait
.
He
replied
that
he
could
not
imagine
what
importance
there
might
be
in
thus
meeting
with
a
stranger
,
but
-
joy
of
joys
,
he
would
be
at
home
at
the
hour
mentioned
.
But
when
she
called
he
had
thought
better
of
the
matter
and
decided
not
to
involve
himself
in
a
new
entanglement
.
She
was
told
by
the
manservant
who
opened
the
door
that
his
lordship
was
engaged
on
work
from
which
he
had
left
strict
orders
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
.
Claire
was
bitterly
disappointed
but
determined
not
to
let
the
rebuff
daunt
her
purpose
.
She
wrote
again
and
now
,
abandoning
for_the_moment
the
theme
of
love
,
she
asked
for
help
in
the
matter
of
her
career
.
She
could
act
and
she
could
write
.
His
lordship
was
concerned
in
the
management
of
Drury_Lane
but
,
if
there
were
no
opportunities
there
,
would
he
read
and
criticize
her
novel
?
At_last
he
consented
to
meet
her
,
and
following
that
brief
interview
Claire
wrote
him
a
yet
more
remarkable
proposal
:
Have
you
any
objection
to
the
following
plan
?
On
Thursday
evening
we
may
go_out
of
town
together
by
some
stage
or
mail
about
the
distance
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
.
There
we
shall
be
free
and
unknown
;
we
can
return
the
following
morning
.
She
concluded
by
asking
for
a
brief
interview
-
``
to
settle
with
you
where
''
-
and
she
threw_in
a
tribute
to
his
``
gentle
manners
''
and
``
the
wild
originality
of
your
countenance
''
.
She
opened
his
reply
with
trembling
fingers
.
He
agreed
!
And
he
would
see
her
that
evening
.
Victory
at_last
!
At
their
meeting
he
told
her
not
to
bother
about
``
where
''
-
he
would
attend
to
that
.
There
was
one
of
the
new
forte-pianos
in
the
room
and
,
as
Claire
rose
to
go
,
he
asked
her
to
sing
him
one
song
before
she
left
.
She
sang
him
Scott
's
charming
ballad
``
Rosabelle
''
,
which
was
the
vogue
of
the
moment
.
She
had
never
sung
better
.
``
Your
voice
is
delightful
''
,
he
approved
with
a
warm
smile
.
``
Tomorrow
will
be
a
new
experience
-
I
have
never
before
made_love
to
a
nightingale
.
There
have
been
cooing
doves
,
chattering
magpies
,
thieving
jackdaws
,
a
proud
peacock
,
a
silly
goose
,
and
a
harpy_eagle
-
whom
I
was
silly
enough
to
mate
with
and
who
is
now
busy
tearing
at
my
vitals
''
.
And
so
they
went
,
he
choosing
of
all
places
an
inn
near
Medmenham_Abbey
,
scene
a
generation
ago
of
the
obscene
orgies
of
the
Hellfire_Club
.
He
regaled
Claire
with
an
account
of
the
mock
mass
performed
by
the
cassocked
bloods
,
which
he
had
had
at
firsthand
from
old
Bud_Dodington
,
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
so-called
``
Order
''
.
Each
wore
the
monkish
scourge
at
his
waist
but
this
,
it
seems
,
was
not
employed
for
self-flagellation
.
Naked
girls
danced
in
the
chancel
of
the
Abbey
,
the
youngest
and
seemingly
the
most
innocent
being
chosen
to
read
a
sermon
filled
with
veiled
depravities
.
The
jaded
amorist
conjured_up
pictures
of
the
blasphemous
rites
with
relish
.
Alas
,
all
that
belonged_to
the
age
of
``
Devil_Dashwood
''
and
``
Wicked_Wilkes
''
,
abbot
and
beadsman
of
the
Order
!
The
casual
seduction
of
a
seventeen
year
old
bluestocking
seemed
tame
by
comparison
.
They
passed
close
by
the
turn
to
Bishopsgate
.
A
scant
half_mile
away
Shelley
and
Mary
were
doubtless
sitting
on
their
diminutive
terrace
,
the
air
about
them
scented
with
stock
,
and
listening
to
the
nightingale
who
had
nested
in
the
big
lime_tree
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
.
Charming
and
peaceful
-
but
what
were
charm
and
peace
compared
to
high
adventure
?
Alone
with
the
fabulous
Byron
!
How
many
women
had
longed
for
the
privilege
that
was
hers
.
How
was
she
to
behave
,
Claire
wondered
.
To
be
passive
,
to
be
girlishly
shy
was
palpably
absurd
.
She
was
the
pursuer
as
clearly
as
was
Venus
in
Shakespeare
's
poem
.
And
while
her
Adonis
did
not
suffer
from
inexperience
,
satiety
might
well
be
an
equal
handicap
.
No
,
she
would
not
pretend
modesty
,
but
neither
must
she
be
crudely
bold
.
Mystery
-
that
was
the
thing
.
In
the
bedroom
she
would
insist
on
darkness
.
With
his
club_foot
he
might
well
be
grateful
.
At
the
inn
,
which
was
situated
close
to
a
broad
weir
,
Byron
was
greeted
by
the
landlord
with
obsequious
deference
and
addressed
as
``
milord
''
.
The
place
was
evidently
a
familiar
haunt
and
Claire
wondered
what
other
illicit
loves
had
been
celebrated
in
the
comfortable
rooms
to
which
they
were
shown
.
The
fire
in
the
sitting_room
was
lighted
.
``
What
about
the
bedroom
''
?
Byron
inquired
.
``
Seems
to
me
last
time
I
was
here
the
grate
bellowed
out
smoke
as
it
might
have
been
preparing
us
for
hell
''
.
``
We
found
some
owls
had
built
a
nest
in
the
chimney
,
milord
,
but
I
promise
you
you
'll
never
have
trouble
of
that
sort
again
''
.
So
,
not_only
had
he
been
here
before
,
but
it
seemed
he
might
well
come
again
.
Claire
felt
suddenly
small
and
cheap
,
heroine
of
a
trivial
episode
in
the
voluminous
history
of
Don_Juan
.
A
cold
supper
was
ordered
and
a
bottle
of
port
.
When
Napoleon
's
ship
had
borne
him
to
Elba
,
French
wines
had
started
to
cross
the
Channel
,
the
first
shipments
in
a
dozen
war-ridden
years
,
but
the
supplies
had
not_yet
reached
rural
hostelries
where
the
sweet
wines
of
the
Spanish
peninsula
still
ruled
.
As
they
waited
for
supper
they
sat
by
the
fire
,
glasses
in_hand
,
while
Byron
philosophized
as
much
for
his
own
entertainment
as
hers
.
``
Sex
is
overpriced
''
,
he
said
.
``
The
great
Greek
tragedies
are
concerned
with
man
against
Fate
,
not
man
against
man
for
the
prize
of
a
woman
's
body
.
So
do
n't
see
yourself
as
a
heroine
or
fancy
this
little
adventure
is
an
event
of
major
importance
''
.
``
The
gods
seemed
to
think
sex
pretty
important
''
,
she
rebutted
.
``
Mars
and
Venus
,
Bacchus
and
Ariadne
,
Jupiter
and
Io
,
Byron
and
the
nymph
of
the
owl
's
nest
.
That
would
be
Minerva
,
I
suppose
.
Was
n't
the
owl
her
symbol
''
?
Byron
laughed
.
``
So
you
know
something
of
the
classics
,
do
you
''
?
``
Tell
me
about
Minerva
,
how
she
behaved
,
what
she
did
to
please
you
''
.
``
I
'll
tell
you
nothing
.
I
do
n't
ask
you
who
'
tis
you
're
being
unfaithful
to
,
husband
or
lover
.
Frankly
,
I
do
n't
care
''
.
For
a
moment
she
thought_of
answering
with
the
truth
but
she
knew
there
were
men
who
shied_away_from
virginity
,
who
demanded
some
degree
of
education
in
body
as_well_as
mind
.
``
Very_well
''
,
she
said
,
``
I
'll
not
catechize
you
.
What
matter
the
others
so_long_as
I
have
my
place
in
history
''
.
She
was
striking_the_right_note
.
No
man
ever
had
a
better
opinion
of
himself
and
indeed
,
with
one
so
favored
,
flattery
could
hardly
seem
overdone
.
Brains
and
beauty
,
high
position
in
both
the
social
and
intellectual
worlds
,
athlete
,
fabled
lover
-
if
ever
the_world_was_any_man's_oyster
it
was
his
.
The
light
supper
over
,
Claire
went
to
him
and
,
slipping
an
arm
about
his
shoulder
,
sat
on
his
knee
.
He
drew
her
close
and
,
hand
on
cheek
,
turned
her
face
to
his
.
Her
lips
,
moist
and
parted
,
spoke
his
name
.
``
Byron
''
!
His
hand
went
to
her
shoulder
and
pushed_aside
the
knotted
scarf
that
surmounted
the
striped
poplin
gown
;
then
,
to
better
purpose
,
he
took_hold_of
the
knot
and
with
dextrous
fingers
,
untied
it
.
The
bodice
beneath
was
buttoned
and
,
withdrawing
his
lips
from
hers
,
he
set
her
upright
on
his
knee
and
started
to
undo
it
,
unhurriedly
as
if
she
were
a
child
.
But
,
kindled
by
his
kiss
,
his
caressing
hand
,
her
desire
was
aflame
.
She
sprang
up
and
went
swiftly
to
the
bedroom
.
Lord_Byron
poured
himself
another
glass
of
wine
and
held
it
up
to
the
candle_flame
admiring
the
rich
color
.
He
drank
slowly
with
due
appreciation
.
It
was
an
excellent
vintage
.
He
rose
and
went
to
the
bedroom
.
Pausing
in
the
doorway
he
said
:
``
The
form
of
the
human
female
,
unlike
her
mind
and
her
spirit
,
is
the
most
challenging
loveliness
in
all
nature
''
.
When
Claire
returned
to
Bishopsgate
she
longed
to
tell
them
she
had
become
Byron
's
mistress
.
By
odd
coincidence
,
on
the
evening
of
her
return
Shelley
chose
to
read
Parisina
,
which
was
the
latest
of
the
titled
poet
's
successes
.
As
he
declaimed
the
sonorous
measures
,
it
was
as_much_as
Claire
could
do
to
restrain
herself
from
bursting_out
with
her
dramatic
tidings
.
``
Although
it
is
not
the
best
of
which
he
is
capable
''
,
said
Shelley
as
he
closed
the
book
,
``
it
is
still
poetry
of
a
high
order
''
.
``
If
he
would
only
leave
the
East
''
,
said
Mary
.
``
I
am
tired_of
sultans
and
scimitars
''
.
``
The
hero
of
his
next
poem
is
Napoleon_Bonaparte
''
,
said
Claire
,
with
slightly
overdone
carelessness
.
``
How
do
you
know
that
''
?
demanded
Mary
.
``
I
was
told
it
on_good_authority
''
,
Claire
answered
darkly
.
``
I
must
n't
tell
,
I
must
n't
tell
''
,
she
repeated
to
herself
.
``
I
promised
him
I
would
n't
''
.
Winter
came
,
and
with
it
Mary
's
baby
-
a
boy
as
she
had
wished
.
William
,
he
was
called
,
in
honor
of
the
man
who
was
at_once
Shelley
's
pensioner
and
his
most
bitter
detractor
.
With
a
pardonable
irony
Shelley
wrote
to
the
father
who
had
publicly
disowned
his
daughter
:
``
Fanny
and
Mrs._Godwin
will
probably
be
glad
to
hear
that
Mary
has
safely
recovered
from
a
very
favorable
confinement
,
and
that
her
child
is
well
''
.
At_the_same_time
another
child
-
this
one
of
Shelley
's
brain
-
was
given
to
the
world
:
Alastor
,
a
poem
of
pervading
beauty
in
which
the
reader
may
gaze
into
the
still
depths
of
a
fine
mind
's
musings
.
Alastor
was
published
only
to
be
savagely
attacked
,
contemptuously
ignored
.
Shelley
sent
a
copy
to
Southey
,
a
former
friend
,
and
another
to
Godwin
.
Neither
acknowledged
the
gift
.
Only
Mary
's
praise
sustained
him
in
his
disappointment
.
She
understood
completely
.
Not
a
thought
nor
a
cadence
was
missed
in
her
summary
of
appreciation
.
``
You
have
made
the
labor
worth_while
''
,
he
said
to
her
,
smiling
.
``
And
in
the
future
,
since
I
write
for
a
public
of
one
,
I
can
save
the
poor
publishers
from
wasting
their
money
''
.
``
A
public
of
one
''
,
Mary
echoed
reprovingly
.
``
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
?
There
will
be
thousands
who
will
thrill
to
the
loveliness
of
Alastor
.
There
are
some
even
now
.
What
about
that
dear
,
clever
Mr._Thynne
?
I
am
sure
he
is
in
raptures
''
.
``
Poor
Mr._Thynne
,
he
always
has
to
be
trotted_out
for
my
encouragement
''
.
``
There
are
other
Mr._Thynnes
.
Not
everyone
is
bewitched
by
Byron
's
caliphs
and
harem
beauties
''
.
Mary
's
super
critical
attitude
toward
Byron
had
nothing
to_do_with
his
moral
disrepute
.
She
was
resentful
of
his
easy
success
as
compared
with
Shelley
's
failure
.
The
same
month
that
Alastor
was
published
,
Murray
sold
twenty
thousand
copies
of
The_Siege_of_Corinth
,
a
slovenly
bit
of
Byronism
that
even
Shelley
's
generosity
rebelled
at
.
The
lordly
poet
was
at
low-water_mark
.
The
careless
writing
was
in
keeping
with
his
mood
of
savage
discontent
.
On
all
sides
doors
were
being
slammed
in
his
face
.
The
previous
scandals
,
gaily
diverting
as
they
were
,
had
only
served
to
increase
his
popularity
.
Now
,
under
the
impact
of
his
wife
's
disclosures
,
he
was
brought
suddenly
to
the
realization
that
there
was
a
limit
to
tolerance
,
however
brilliant
,
however
far-famed
the
offender
might
be
.
He
tried
defiance
and
openly
flaunted
his
devotion
to
his
half_sister
,
but
he
soon
saw
,
as
did
she
,
that
this
course
if
persisted_in
would
involve
them
in
a
common
ruin
.
For_the_moment
there
was
no
woman
in
his
life
,
and
it
was
this
vacuum
that
had
given
Claire
her
opportunity
.
But
the
liaison
successfully
started
in
the
last
days
of
autumn
was
now
languishing
.
Byron
,
since
the
separation
from
his
wife
had
been
living
in
a
smallish
house
in
Piccadilly_Terrace
.
He
refused
to
bring
Claire
to
it
even
as
an
occasional
visitor
,
claiming
that
his
every
move
was
watched
by
spies
of
the
Milbankes
.
