Ambassador_Stevenson
yesterday
described
the
U.
N
.
's
problem
of
electing
a
temporary
successor
to
the
late
Dag_Hammarskjold
as
``
the
gravest
crisis
the
institution
has
faced
''
.
Of_course
it
is
.
If
the
decision
goes_wrong
,
it
may
be
-
as
Mr._Stevenson
fears
-
``
the
first_step
on
the
slippery
path
downhill
''
to
a
U._N.
without
operational
responsibilities
and
without
effective
meaning
.
The
integrity
of
the
office
not
merely
requires
that
the
Secretary_General
shall
be
,
as
the
Charter
puts
it
,
``
the
chief
administrative
officer
of
the
Organization
''
,
but
that
neither
he
nor
his
staff
shall
seek
or
receive
instructions
from
any
government
or
any
other
authority
``
external
to
the
Organization
''
.
In_other_words
,
the
Secretary_General
is
to
be
a
nonpartisan
,
international
servant
,
not
a
political
,
national
one
.
He
should
be
,
as
Dag_Hammarskjold
certainly
was
,
a
citizen
of
the
world
.
The
Charter
does
stipulate
that
``
due
regard
''
shall
be
paid
to
the
importance
of
recruiting
the
staff
on
``
as
wide
a
geographical
basis
as
possible
''
.
The
United_States
and
its
allies
have
had
no
objection
to
this
.
What
they
have
objected
to
is
the
attempt
of
the
Russians
to
make
use
of
the
tragedy
of
Dag_Hammarskjold
's
death
to
turn
the
entire
U._N.
staff
from
the
Secretary
down
into
political
agents
of
the
respective
countries
from
which
they
come
.
The
controversy
now
revolves
mainly
around
the
number
and
geographic
origin
of
the
deputies
of
the
Secretary_General
and
,
more
particularly
,
around
the
nature
of
his
relationship
with
them
.
Although
the
United_States
and
the
U._S._S._R.
have
been
arguing
whether
there
shall
be
four
,
five
or
six
top
assistants
,
the_most
important
element
in
the
situation
is
not
the
number
of
deputies
but
the
manner
in_which
these
deputies
are
to
do
their
work
.
If
any
one
of
them
has
any
power
to
veto
the
Secretary_General
's
decisions
the
nature
of
the
organization
will
have
changed
.
If
they
give
him
advice
when
he
asks
it
,
or
if
they
perform
specified
duties
under
his
direction
,
the
nature
of
the
U._N.
will
not
of_necessity
change
.
The
Secretary_General
must
have
,
subject_to
the
constitutional
direction
of
the
Security_Council
and
the
General_Assembly
,
the
power
to
act
,
to
propose
action
and
to
organize
action
without
being
hobbled
by
advisers
and
assistants
acting_on
someone
else
's
instructions
.
This
is
the
root
issue
for
which
the
United_States
should
stand
.
We
should
not
become
confused
or
let
our
public
become
confused
over
irrelevant
questions
of
number
or
even
of
geography
.
What
we
must
have
,
if
the
United_Nations
is
to
survive
,
is
as
nonpolitical
,
nonpartisan
an
organization
at
the
top
as
human_beings
can
make
it
,
subject_to
no
single
nation
's
direction
and
subservient
to
no
single
nation
's
ambition
.
The
new
City_Charter
,
which
should
get
a
Yes
vote
as
Question
No.
1
on
Nov.
7
,
would
not
make
a
good
Mayor
out
of
a
bad
one
.
There
is
no
such
magic
in
man-made
laws
.
But
it
would
greatly
strengthen
any
Mayor
's
executive
powers
,
remove
the
excuse
in
large
degree
that
he
is
a
captive
of
inaction
in
the
Board
of
Estimate
,
increase
his
budget-making
authority
both
as
to
expense
and
capital
budgets
,
and
vest
in
him
the
right
to
reorganize
city
departments
in
the
interest
of
efficiency
and
economy
.
Lawmaking
power
is
removed
from
the
Board
of
Estimate
and
made
a
partnership
responsibility
of
the
City_Council
and
the
Mayor
.
Thus
there
is
a
clearer
division
of
authority
,
administrative
and
legislative
.
The
board
is
diminished
in
both
respects
,
while
it
retains
control
over
zoning
,
franchises
,
pier
leases
,
sale
,
leasing
and
assignment
of
property
,
and
other
trusteeship
functions
.
The
board
will
be
able
to
increase
,
decrease
,
add
or
eliminate
budget_items
,
subject_to
the
Mayor
's
veto
;
but
the
City_Council
will
now
share
fully
this
budget-altering
power
.
Overriding
of
mayoral
veto
on
budget
changes
will
require
concurrence
by
board
and
Council
,
and
a
two-thirds
vote
.
The
Controller
retains
his
essential
``
fiscal
watchdog
''
functions
;
his
broad
but
little
used
investigative
powers
are
confirmed
.
He
loses
now-misplaced
tax_collection
duties
,
which
go
to
the
Finance_Department
.
On
net
balance
,
in_spite_of
Controller_Gerosa
's
opposition
to
the
new
Charter
as
an
invasion
of
his
office
,
the
Controller
will
have
the
opportunity
for
greater
usefulness
to
good
government
than
he
has
now
.
Borough
Presidents
,
while
retaining
membership
in
the
Board
of
Estimate
,
lose
their
housekeeping
functions
.
Highways
go
to
a
new
Department
of
Highways
,
sewers
to
the
Department
of
Public_Works
,
such
street
cleaning
as
Borough
Presidents
now
do
(
in
Queens
and
Richmond
)
to
the
Sanitation_Department
.
Some
fiscal
changes
are
important
.
The
expense
(
operating
)
budget
is
to
be
a
program
budget
,
and
red_tape
is
cut
to
allow
greater
autonomy
(
with
the
Mayor
approving
)
in
fund
transfers
within
a
department
.
The
capital
budget
,
for
construction
of
permanent
improvements
,
becomes
an
appropriating
document
instead
of
just
a
calendar
of
pious
promises
;
but
,
as
a
second-look
safeguard
,
each
new
project
must
undergo
a
Board
of
Estimate
public
hearing
before
construction
proceeds
.
A
road
block
to
desirable
local
or
borough
improvements
,
heretofore
dependent_on
the
pocketbook
vote
of
taxpayers
and
hence
a
drag
on
progress
,
is
removed
by
making
these
a
charge
against
the
whole
city
instead
of
an
assessment
paid
by
those
immediately
affected
.
This
will
have
a
beneficial
effect
by
expediting
public
business
;
it
will
also
correct
some
injustices
.
Enlargement
of
the
City_Council
and
a
new
method
of
selecting
members
will
be
discussed
tomorrow
.
The
Inter-american_Press_Association
,
which
blankets
the
Western_Hemisphere
from
northern
Canada
to
Cape_Horn
,
is
meeting
in
New_York_City
this
week
for_the_first_time
in
eleven
years
.
The
I._A._P._A.
is
a
reflection
of
the
problems
and
hopes
of
the
hemisphere
;
and
in
these
days
this
inevitably
means
a
concentration
on
the
effects
of
the
Cuban
revolution
.
As
the
press
in
Cuba
was
gradually
throttled
by
the
Castro
regime
,
more_and_more
Cuban
publishers
,
editors
and
correspondents
were
forced
into
exile
.
The
I._A._P._A.
found
itself
driven
from
journalism
into
politics
as
it
did
its
best
to
bring_about
the
downfall
of
the
Castro_Government
and
the
return
of
the
Cuban
press
to
the
freedom
it
knew
before
Batista
's
dictatorship
began
in
1952
.
Freedom_of_the_press
was
lost
in
Cuba
because
of
decades
of
corruption
and
social
imbalances
.
In
such
conditions
all
freedoms
are
lost
.
This
,
in
more
diplomatic
language
,
is
what
Adlai_Stevenson
told
the
newspaper
men
of
Latin_America
yesterday
on
behalf
of
the
United_States_Government
.
He
felt
able
to
end
on
a
note
of
hope
.
He
sees
evidence
of
fair
winds
for
the
ten-year
Alliance
for
Progress
plan
with
its
emphasis
on
social
reforms
.
No
group
can
contribute
more
to
the
success
of
the
program
than
the
editors
and
publishers
of
the
Inter-American_Press_Association
.
The
Twenty-second
Soviet
Communist_Party
Congress
opens
in
Moscow
today
in
a
situation
contrasting
sharply
with
the
script
prepared
many
months
ago
when
this
meeting
was
first
announced
.
According
to
the
original
program
,
Premier_Khrushchev
expected
the
millions
looking
toward
the
Kremlin
this
morning
to
be
filled
with_admiration
or
rage
-
depending_upon
individual
or
national
politics
-
because
of
the
``
bold
program
for
building
communism
in
our
time
''
which
the
Congress
will
adopt
.
But
far
from
being
concerned
about
whether
or
not
Russia
will
have
achieved
Utopia
by
1980
,
the
world
is
watching
Moscow
today
primarily
for
clues
as
to
whether
or
not
there
will
be
nuclear
Armageddon
in
the
immediate
future
.
The
evident
contradiction
between
the
rosy
picture
of
Russia
's
progress
painted
by
the
Communist_party
's
program
and
the
enormous
dangers
for
all
humanity
posed
by
Premier_Khrushchev
's
Berlin
policy
has
already
led
to
speculation
abroad
that
the
program
may
be
severely
altered
.
Whether
it
is
or
not
,
the
propaganda
impact
on
the
free_world
of
the
document
scheduled
to
be
adopted
at
this
meeting
will
be
far
less_than
had
been
originally
anticipated
.
And
there
must
be
many
Soviet
citizens
who
know
what
is
going_on
and
who
realize
that
before
they
can
hope
to
enjoy
the
full
life
promised
for
1980
they
and
their
children
must
first
survive
.
This
Congress
will
see
Premier_Khrushchev
consolidating
his
power
and
laying
the
groundwork
for
an
orderly
succession
should
death
or
illness
remove
him
from
the
scene
in
the
next
few
years
.
The
widespread
purge
that
has
taken_place
the
past
twelve
months
or_so
among
Communist
leaders
in
the
provinces
gives
assurance
that
the
party
officials
who
will
dominate
the
Congress
,
and
the
Central_Committee
it
will
elect
,
will
all
have
passed
the
tightest
possible
Khrushchev
screening
,
both
for
loyalty
to
him
and
for
competence
and
performance
on_the_job
.
Dr._James_B._Conant
has
earned
a
nationwide
reputation
as
a
moderate
and
unemotional
school
reformer
.
His
earlier
reports
considered
the
American
public_schools
basically
sound
and
not
in
need
of
drastic
change
.
Now
,
a
close
look
at
the
schools
in
and
around
the
ten
largest
cities
,
including
New_York
,
has
shattered
this
optimism
.
Dr._Conant
has
come_away
shocked
and
angry
.
His
new
book
,
entitled
``
Slums
and
Suburbs
''
,
calls_for
fast
and
drastic
action
to
avert
disaster
.
There
is
room
for
disagreement
concerning
some
of
Dr._Conant
's
specific
views
.
His
strong
opposition
to
the
transfer
of
Negro
children
to
schools
outside
their
own
neighborhood
,
in
the
interest
of
integration
,
will
be
attacked
by
Negro
leaders
who
have
fought
for
,
and
achieved
,
this
open
or
permissive
enrollment
.
Dr._Conant
may
underestimate
the
psychological
importance
of
even
token
equality
.
His
suggestion
that
the
prestige
colleges
be
made
the
training
institutions
for
medical
,
law
and
graduate_schools
will
run_into
strong
opposition
from
these
colleges
themselves
-
even_though
what
he
is
recommending
is
already
taking_shape
as
a
trend
.
But
these
are
side
issues
to
a
powerful
central
theme
.
That
theme
cuts
through
hypocrisies
,
complacency
and
double-talk
.
It
labels
the
slums
,
especially
the
Negro
slums
,
as
dead-end_streets
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
youngsters
.
The
villains
of
the
piece
are
those
who
deny
job
opportunities
to
these
youngsters
,
and
Dr._Conant
accuses
employers
and
labor_unions
alike
.
The
facts
,
he
adds
,
are
hidden
from
public
view
by
squeamish
objections
to
calling
bad_conditions
by
their
right
name
and
by
insistence
on
token
integration
rather_than
on
real
improvement
of
the
schools
,
regardless_of
the
color
of
their
students
.
A
call
for
action
``
before
it
is
too
late
''
has
alarming
implications
when
it
comes
from
a
man
who
,
in
his
previous
reports
on
the
schools
,
cautioned
so
strongly
against
extreme
measures
.
These
warnings
must_not
be
treated
lightly
.
Dr._Conant
's
conscientious
,
selfless
efforts
deserve
the
nation
's
gratitude
.
He
has
served
in
positions
of
greater
glamour
,
both
at_home
and
abroad
;
but
he
may
well
be
doing
his
greatest
service
with
his
straightforward
report
on
the
state
of
the
public_schools
.
A
fascinating
letter
has
just
reached
this
desk
from
a
correspondent
who
likes
to
receive
so-called
junk
mail
.
He
was
delighted
to
learn
that
the
Post_Office_Department
is
now
going_to
expand
this
service
to
deliver
mail
from
Representatives
in
Congress
to
their
constituents
without
the
use
of
stamps
,
names
,
addresses
or
even
zone
numbers
.
In_accordance_with
legislation
passed
at
the
last
session
of
Congress
,
each
Representative
is
authorized
to
deliver
to
the
Post_Office
in
bulk
newsletters
,
speeches
and
other
literature
to
be
dropped
in
every
letter_box
in
his
district
.
This
means
an
added
burden
to
innumerable
postmen
,
who
already
are
complaining
of
heavy
loads
and
low
pay
,
and
it
presumably
means
an
increased
postal
deficit
,
but
,
our
correspondent
writes
,
think_of
the
additional
junk
mail
each
citizen
will
now
be
privileged
to
receive
on_a_regular_basis
.
Letter
writing
is
a
dying
art
.
Occasional
letters
are
sent
by
individuals
to
one
another
and
many
are
written
by
companies
to
one
another
,
but
these
are
mostly
typewritten
.
Most
mail
these
days
consists_of
nothing
that
could
truly
be
called
a
letter
.
