will

Europe
before

to
open
the
symphony
's
Golden_Anniversary
season
,
it

The

the
Orchestra

.
The

abroad
,
Jorda
recently
conducted

Orchestre_Philharmonique
de
Bordeau
in
France
,
and
the
Santa_Cecilia_Orchestra

Rome
.
In

Jorda

,
the
orchestra
also
announced
that
the
sale
of
single
tickets
for
the
50
th
anniversary
season
will
start
at
the
Sherman_Clay
box_office
on
Wednesday
.
Guest
performers
and
conductors
during
the
coming
season
will
include
many
renowned
artists
who
began
their
careers
playing
with
the
orchestra
,
including
violinists
Yehudi_Menuhin
,
Isaac_Stern
,
Ruggiero_Ricci
and
David_Abel
;
pianists
Leon
Fleisher
,
Ruth_Slenczynka
and
Stephen_Bishop
and
conductor
Earl_Bernard_Murray
.
The
Leningrad_Kirov_Ballet
,
which
opened
a
series
of
performances
Friday
night
at
the
Opera_House
,
is
,
I
think
,
the
finest
``
classical
''
ballet_company
I
have
ever
seen
,
and
the
production
of
the
Petipa-Tschaikowsky
``
Sleeping_Beauty
''
with
which
it
began
the
series
is
incomparably
the
finest
I
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
.
This
work
is
no
favorite
of
mine
.
I
am
prepared
to
demonstrate
at
an
ytime
that
it
represents
the
spirit
of
Imperial_Russia
in
its
most
vulgar
,
infantile
,
and
reactionary
aspect
;
that
its
persistent
use
by
ballet_companies
of
the
Soviet
regime
indicates
that
that
old
spirit
is
just_as
stultifying
alive
today
as
it
ever
was
;
that
its
presentation
in_this
country
is
part
of
a
capitalist
plot
to
boobify
the
American
people
;
that
its
choreography
is
undistinguished
and
its
score
a
shapeless
assemblage
of
self-plagiarisms
.
All_of
this
is
true
and
all_of
it
is
totally
meaningless
in
the
face
of
the
Kirov
's
utterly
captivating
presentation
.
The
reasons
for
this
enchantment
are
numerous
,
but
most_of
them
end
in
``
ova
''
,
``
eva
''
,
or
``
aya
''
.
In_other_words
,
no
merely
male
creature
can
resist
that
corps_de_ballet
.
It
seems
to
have
been
chosen
exclusively
from
the
winners
of
beauty
contests
-
Miss_Omsk
,
Miss_Pinsk
,
Miss_Stalingr
-
oops
,
skip
it
.
These
qualities
alone
,
however
,
would
not
account_for
their
success
,
and
it
took
me
a
while
to
discover
the
crowning
virtue
that
completes
this
company
's
collective
personality
.
It
is
a
kind_of
friendliness
and
frankness
of
address
toward
the
audience
which
we
have
been
led
to
believe
was
peculiar_to
the
American
ballet
.
that
convention
of
Russian
ballet
whereby
the
girls
convey
the
idea
that
they
are
all
the
daughters
of
impoverished
Grand_Dukes
driven
to
thestage
out
of
filial
piety
,
is
totally
absent
from
the
Kirov
.
This
is
all
the
more
remarkable
because
the
Kirov
is
to
ballet
what
Senator_Goldwater
is
to
American
politics
.
But
,
obviously
,
at_least
some
things
have
changed
for
the
better
in
Russia
so_far
as
the
ballet
is
concerned
.
Irina_Kolpakova
,
the
Princess_Aurora
of
Friday
's
performance
,
would
be
a
change_for_the_better
anywhere
,
at_any_time
,
no_matter
who
had
had
the
role
before
.
She
is
the_most
beautiful
thing
you
ever
laid_eyes_on
,
and
her
dancing
has
a
feminine
suavity
,
lightness
,
sparkle
,
and
refinement
which
are
simply
incomparable
.
Alla_Sizova
,
who
seems
to
have
made
a
special
hit
in
the
East
,
was
delightful
as
the
lady
Bluebird
and
her
partner
,
Yuri_Soloviev
,
was
wonderfully
virile
,
acrobatic
,
and
poetic
all
at_the_same_time
,
in
a
tradition
not
unlike
that
of
Nijinsky
.
Vladilen_Semenov
,
a
fine
``
danseur_noble
''
;
Konstantin_Shatilov
,
a
great
character
dancer
;
and
Inna_Zubkovskaya
,
an
excellent
Lilac_Fairy
,
were
other
outstanding
members
of
the
cast
,
but
every
member
of
the
cast
was
magnificent
.
The
production
,
designed
by
Simon_Virsaladze
,
was
completely
traditional
but
traditional
in
the_right_way
.
It
was
done
with
great
taste
,
was
big
and
spacious
,
sumptuous
as
the
dreams
of
any
peasant
in
its
courtly
costumes
,
but
sumptuous
in
a
muted
,
pastel-like
style
,
with
rich
,
quiet
harmonies
of
color
between
the
costumes
themselves
and
between
the
costumes
and
the
scenery
.

,

excellent
soloists
-
the
violin
solos
by
the

Guy_Lumia
,
were
especially
fine
-
but
one
in_which
the
core
of
traveling
players
and
the
body
of
men
added
locally
had
not
had
time
to
achieve
much
unity
.

Famed
cellist
Pablo_Casals
took
his
instrument
to
the
East_Room
of
the
White_House
yesterday
and
charmed
the
staff
with
a
two-hour
rehearsal
.
He
was
getting
the
feel
of

room
for
a
concert
tomorrow
night
for
Puerto_Rico

President_Kennedy
's
invitation
to
the
Spanish-born
master
said
,
``
We
feel
your
performance
as
one
of
the
world
's
greatest
artists
would
lend
distinction
to
the
entertainment
of

''
.
For
a
good
many
seasons
I
've
been
looking
at
the
naughty
stuff
on
television
,
so
the
other
night
I
thought
I
ought
to
see
how
immorality
is
doing
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
in
movies
.
After_all
,
this
year
's
movies
are
next
year
's
television_shows
.
So
I
went
to
see
``
La_Dolce_Vita
''
.
It
has
been
billed
as
a
towering
monument
to
immorality
.
All
the
sins
of
ancient
Rome
are
said
to
be
collected
into
this
three-hour
film
.
If
that
's
all
the
Romans
did
,
it
's
a
surprise
to
me
that
Rome
fell
.
After
television
,
``
La_Dolce_Vita
''
seems
as
harmless
as
a
Gray_Line
tour
of
North_Beach
at
night
.
I
cannot
imagine
a
single
scene
that_is
n't
done
in
a
far
naughtier
manner
on
TV
every_week
.
I
believe
TV
watchers
will
be
bored
.
``
La_Dolce_Vita
''
has
none
of
the
senseless
brutality
or
sadism
of
the
average
TV
Western
.
Week
in
,
week
out
,
there
is
more
sex
to
be
seen
in
``
The
Adventures
of
Ozzie
and
Harriet
''
.
There
is
more
decadence
on
``
77
Sunset_Strip
''
.
There
are
more
obvious
nymphomaniacs
on
any
private-eye
series
.
In
another
respect
,
television
viewers
will
feel
right
at_home
because
most_of
the
actors
are
unknowns
.
With
the
exception
of
Lex_Barker
and
Anita_Ekberg
,
the
credits
are
as
unfamiliar
as
you
'll
find
on
the
Robert_Herridge_Theater
.
Most_of
the
emphasis
has
been
placed
on
a
``
wild
party
''
at
a
seaside
villa
.
Producer
Fellini
should
have
looked
at
some
of
the
old
silent
films
where
they
really
had
parties
!
The
Dolce_Vita
get-together
boasted
a
strip
tease
(
carried
as
far
as
a
black
slip
)
;
a
lady
drunk
on
her
hands
and
knees
who
carries
the
hero
around
on
her
back
while
he
throws
pillow
feathers
in
her
face
;
a
frigid
beauty
,
and
three
silly
fairies
.
Put
them
all_together
and
they
spell_out
the
only
four-letter
word
I
can
think_of
:
dull
.
Apparently
Fellini
caught
the
crowd
when
its
parties
had
begun
to
pall
.
What
a
swinging
group
they
must
have
been
when
they
first
started
entertaining
!
As
a
moral
shocker
it
is
a
dud
.
But
this
does
n't
detract
from
its
merit
as
an
interesting
,
if_not
great
,
film
.
The
Chronicle
's
Paine_Knickerbocker
summed
it
up
neatly
:
``
This
is
a
long
picture
and
a
controversial
one
,
but
basically
it
is
a
moral
,
enthralling
and
heartbreaking
description
of
humans
who
have
become
unlinked
from
life
as
perhaps
Rome
has
from
her
traditional
political
,
cultural
and
religious
glories
''
.
And
when
they
sell
it
to
television
in
a_couple_of
years
,
it
can
be
shown
without
editing

problems

The
week
went_along
briskly
enough
.
I
bought
a
new
little
foreign
bomb
.
It
is
a
British
bomb
.
Very
austere
yet
racy
.
It
is
very
chic
to
drive
foreign
cars
.
With
a
foreign
car
you
must
wear
a
cap
-
it
has
a
leather
band
in_the_back
.
You
must
also
wear
a
car
coat
.
The
wardrobe
for
a
foreign
bomb
is
a_little
expensive
.
But
we
could
n't
really
get_along
without
it
.
``
Where
do
you
put
the
lighter

''
?
asked
the
gas_station
man
.
The
present
crop
of
small
cars
is
enriching
American
humor
.
Gas_station
people
are
very
debonair
about
small
cars
.
When
I
drove
a
car
with
tail_fins
,
I
had
plenty
status
at
the
wind-and-water
oases
.
My
car
gulped
20
gallons
without
even
wiping
its
mouth
.
This
excellent
foreign
bomb
takes
only
six
.
When
I
had
my
big
job
with
the
double
headlights
and
yards
of
chrome
,
the
gas
people
were
happy
to
see
me
.
``
Tires
OK
?
Check
the
oil
and
water
,
sir
?
''
They
polished
the
windshield
.
They
had
a
loving
touch
.
The
man
stuck
the
nozzle
in
the
gas_tank
.
``
What
kind_of
car
is
it
''
?
he
asked
gloomily
.
``
It
is
a
British
Austin
,
the
smallest
they
make
''
.
``
Get
much
mileage
''
?
``
About
35
''
.
The
gas_station
man
sighed
unhappily
.
``
What
I
always
say
is
what
if
somebody
clobbers
you
in
a_little
car
like
that
?

,
that
's
all

wrote

.
``
I
will
die
rich

``

will
be

said
the
gas_station

.
``
The
windshield
looks
pretty
clean

.
Ah
,
the
fair-weather
friends
of
yesteryear
!
When
I
wheeled
about
,
finned
fore
and
aft
,
I
was
the
darling
of
the
doormen
.
Dollar_bills
skidded
off
my
hands

they
tipped
their

politely

tuck
