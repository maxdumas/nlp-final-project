J._Vernon
,
Prop.
Coaching
had
declined
considerably
by
1905
,
but
the
sign
was
still
there
,
near
the
old
Wells_Fargo
building
in
San_Francisco
,
creaking
in
the
fog
as
it
had
for
thirty
years
.
John_Vernon
had
had
all
the
patronage
he
cared_for
-
he
had
prospered
,
but
he
could
not
retire
from
horsedom
.
Coaching
was
in
his
blood
.
He
had
two
interests
in
life
:
the
pleasures
of
the
table
and
driving
.
Twice
a
week
he
drove
his
tallyho
over
the
Santa_Cruz
road
,
upland
and
through
the
redwood
forest
,
with
orchards
below
him
at
one
hand
,
and
glimpses
of
the
Pacific
at
the
other
.
The
journey
back
he
made
along
the
coast
road
,
traveling
hell-for-leather
,
every
lantern
of
the
tallyho
ablaze
.
The
southward
route
was
the
classic
run
in
California
,
and
the_most
fashionable
.
His
patronage
on
this
stretch
was
made_up
largely
of
San_Franciscans
-
regulars
,
most_of
them
,
and
trenchermen
like
himself
.
They
did
not
complain
at
the
inhuman
hour
of
starting
(
seven
in
the
morning
)
,
nor
of
the
tariff
,
which
was
reasonable
since
it
covered
everything
but
the
tobacco
.
Breakfast
was
at
the
Palace_Hotel
,
luncheon
was
somewhere
in
the
mountain
forest
,
and
dinner
was
either
at
Boulder_Creek
or
at
Santa_Cruz
.
Gazing
too
long
at
the
scenery
could
be
tiring
,
so
halts
were
contrived
between
meals
.
Then
the
Chinese
hostler
,
who
rode
with
Vernon
on
the
box
,
would
break_open
a
hamper
and
produce
filets
of
smoked
bass
or
sturgeon
,
sandwiches
,
pickled
eggs
,
and
a
rum
sangaree
to
be
heated
over
a
spirit_lamp
.
In
spring
and
in
autumn
the
run
was
made
for
a
group
of
botanists
which
included
an
old
friend
of
mine
.
They
gathered
roots
,
bulbs
,
odd
ferns
,
leaves
,
and
bits
of
resin
from
the
rare
Santa_Lucia_fir
,
which
exists
only
on
a
forty-five
mile
strip
on
the
westerly
side
of
these
mountains
.
In
the
Spanish
days
Franciscan
monks
roamed
here
to
collect
the
resin
for
incense
.
It
yields
a
fragrance
as
Orphic
as
that
of
the
pastilles
of
Malabar
.
Vernon
was
serviceable
on
the
botanical
field
trips
,
but
he
could
arrange
no
schedule
with
the
cooks
,
and
he
was
glad
when
the
trips
dropped_off
,
and
the
botanists
began
to
motor
out
by
themselves
.
My
friend
often
breakfasted
with
Vernon
on
the
morning
of
the
regular
tallyho
run
.
This
was
an
honor
,
like
dining
with
a
captain
at
his
private
table
.
Vernon
's
office
adjoined
the
stable
,
and
the
walls
were
adorned
with
brightly
colored
lithographs
,
the
folk_art
of
the
period
.
They
advertised
harness
polish
,
liniments
,
Ball
's
Rubber_Boots
,
Green_River
Whiskey
,
Hood
's
Sarsaparilla
,
patent_medicines
,
shoe
blacking
,
and
chewing
tobacco
.
The
hostler
would
have
the
table
ready
and
a
pot
of
coffee
hissing
on
the
stove
;
then
a
porter
from
Manning
's
Fish_House
would
trot
in
with
a
tray
on
his
head
.
It
was
draped
with
snowy
napkins
that
kept
hot
a
platter
of
oyster
salt
roast
and
a
mound
of
corn_fritters
.
Vernon
was
consummately
fond
of
oysters
,
and
Manning
's
had
been
famous
for
them
since
the
Civil_War
.
Oyster
salt
roast
-
oysters
on
the
half
shell
,
cooked
on
a
bed
of
coarse
salt
that
kept
them
hot
when
served
-
was
a
standby
at
Manning
's
.
Its
early
morning
patrons
were
coachmen
,
who
fortified
themselves
for
the
day
with_that
delicacy
.
In
the
1890
's
the
Palace_Hotel
began
serving
an
oyster
dish
named
after
its
manager
,
John_C._Kirkpatrick
.
This
dish
much
resembles
the
oysters_Rockefeller
made
famous
by
Antoine
's
in
New_Orleans
,
though
the
Palace
chef
announced
it
as
a
variant
of
Manning
's
roast
oysters
.
(
Gastronomes
have
long
argued
about
which
came
first
,
the
Palace
's
or
Antoine
's
.
Antoine
's
held
as
mandatory
a
splash
of
absinthe
or
Pernod
on
the
parsley
or
spinach
which
was
used
for
the
underbedding
.
The
Kirkpatrick
version
holds
liqueur
as
optional
.
)
Vernon
,
however
,
held_out
for
plain
oyster
roast
,
and
plenty
of_it
,
unadorned
by
herbs
or
any
seasoning
but
salt
,
though
he
did
fancy
a_bit
of
lemon
.
After
the
meal
,
he
and
his
guests
went_out
to
inspect
the
rig
;
this
was
merely
a
ritual
,
to
please
all
hands
concerned
.
The
tallyho
had
cost
Vernon
$
2300
.
A
replica
of
two
coaches
made
in
England
for
the
Belmont_Club
in
the
East
,
and
matchless
west
of
the
Rockies
,
it
was
the
despair
of
whips
on
the
Santa_Cruz
run
.
One
could
shave
in
the
reflection
of
its
French-polished
panels
,
and
its
axles
were
greased
like
those
of
roulette_wheels
.
The
horses
were
groomed
to
a
high
gloss
;
departing
,
they
stepped
solemnly
with
knees
lifted
to
the
jaw
,
for
they
had
been
trained
to
drag
at
important
funerals
.
But
for
the
start
of
the
Santa_Cruz
run
,
the
whip
fell
.
The
clients
boarded
the
tallyho
at
the
Palace
promptly
at
seven
.
They
had
been
fed
a
hunting
breakfast
,
so
called
because
a
kedgeree
,
the
dish
identified
with
fox_hunting
,
was
on
the
bill
.
There
are
many
ways
of
making
a
kedgeree
,
every
one
of_which
is
right
.
Here
is
an
original
kedgeree
recipe
from
the
Family_Club
's
kitchen
.
Flake
(
for
three
)
a
cupful
of
cold
boiled
haddock
,
mix
with
a
cupful
of
cooked
rice
,
two
minced
hard-boiled_eggs
,
some
buttery
white_sauce
done_with
cream
,
cayenne
,
pepper
,
salt
,
a
pinch
of
curry
,
a
tablespoonful
of
minced
onion
fried
,
and
a_bit
of
anchovy
.
Heat
and
serve
hot
on
toast
.
The
omelet
named
for
Ernest_Arbogast
,
the
Palace
's
chef
,
was
even
more
in_demand
.
For
decades
it
was
the_most
popular
dish
served
in
the
Ladies
'
Grill
at
breakfast
,
and
it
is
one
of
the
few
old
Palace
dishes
that
still
survive
.
Native_California
oysters
,
salty
and
piquant
,
as
coppery
as
Delawares
and
not_much
larger
than
a
five-cent
piece
,
went
into
it
.
The
original
formula
goes
thus
.
Fry
in
butter
a
small
minced
onion
,
rub
with
a
tablespoonful
of
flour
,
add
half
a
cup
of
cream
,
six
beaten
eggs
,
pepper
,
celery_salt
,
a
teaspoonful
of
minced
chives
,
a
dash
of
cayenne
,
and
a
pinch
of
nutmeg
.
A
jigger
of
dry
Sherry
follows
,
and
as
the
mixture
stiffens
,
in
go
a_hundred
of
the
little
oysters
.
Louis_Sherry
once
stayed
a
fortnight
at
the
Palace
,
and
he
was
so
pleased
with
omelet
Arbogast
that
he
introduced
it
at
his
restaurant
in
New_York
.
J._Pierpont_Morgan
had
come_in
his
private
train
to
San_Francisco
,
to
attend
an
Episcopal
convention
,
and
brought
the
restaurateur
with
him
.
As
things
happened
,
Morgan
was_installed
in
the
Nob_Hill
residence
of
a
magnate
friend
,
whose
kitchen
swarmed
with
cooks
of
approved
talent
.
Sherry
remained
in
his
hotel
suite
,
where
he
amused
himself
as
best
he
could
.
Twice
he
left
everything
to
his
entourage
,
and
fled
to
make
the
Santa_Cruz
tour
under
Vernon
's
guidance
.
In
the
grand
court
of
the
Palace
,
notable
for
its
tiers
of
Moorish
galleries
that
looked
down
on
the
maelstrom
of
vehicles
below
,
Vernon
's
station
was
at
the
entrance
.
It
was
a
post
of
honor
,
held
inviolate
for
him
;
he
had
the
primacy
among
the
coachmen
.
Of
majestic
build
,
rubicund
and
slash-mouthed
,
he
resembled
the
late
General_Winfield_Scott
,
who
was
said
to
be
the_most
imposing
general
of
his
century
,
if_not
of
all
centuries
.
Vernon
wore
a
gray
tall
hat
,
a
gardenia
,
and
maroon
Wellington_boots
that
glistened
like
currant
jelly
.
Promptly
at
seven
he
would
clatter
out
of
the
court
with
twelve
in
the
tallyho
.
He
had
style
:
he
held
his
reins
in
a
loose
bunch
at
the
third
button
of
his
checked
Epsom
surtout
,
and
when
the
horses
leaned
at
a
curve
,
as
if
bent
by
the
force
of
a
gale
,
he
leaned
with
them
.
They
cantered
down
the
peninsula
,
not
slackening
until
the
coach
reached
Woodside
where
the
Santa_Cruz
uplands
begin
.
The
road
maps
of
the
region
have
changed
since
1905
;
inns
have
burned_down
,
moved
elsewhere
,
or
taken
other
names
.
Once
on_the_road
(
and
especially
if
the
passengers
were
all
regulars
and
masculine
)
,
the
schedule
meant
nothing
.
An
agreeable
ease
suffused
Vernon
and
the
passengers
of
the
tallyho
,
from
which
there
issued
clouds
of
smoke
.
Vernon
would
tilt
his
hat
over
one
ear
as
he
lounged
with
his
feet
on
the
dashboard
,
indulging
in
a
huge
cigar
.
The
horses
moved
at
a
clump
;
they
were
no_more
on
parade
than
was
their
driver
;
one
fork
of
the
road
was
as_good_as
another
.
The
Santa_Cruz
mountains
sprawl
over
three
counties
,
and
the
roads
twist
through
sky-tapping
redwoods
down
whose
furrowed
columns
ripple
streams
of
rain
,
even
when
heat
bakes
the
Santa_Clara
valley
below
at
the
left
.
The
water
splashes
into
shoulder-high
tracts
of
fernery
.
You
arrive
there
in
seersucker
,
and
feel
you
were
half-witted
not
to
bring
a
mackintosh
.
Vernon
kept
an
account_book
with
a
list
of
all
the
establishments
that
he
thought
worthy
of
patronage
.
A_number_of
them
must
have
fallen_into
disfavor
;
they
were
struck_out
with
remarks
in
red
ink
,
denouncing
both
the
cooks
and
the
management
.
He
was
copious
in
his
praise
of
those
that
served
food
that
was
good
to
eat
.
The
horses
seemed
to
know
these
by
instinct
,
he
used_to
say
:
such
places
invariably
had
stables
with
superior
feed
bins
.
There
was
Wright
's
,
for
one
,
lost
amongst
trees
,
its
wide
verandas
strewn
with
rockers
.
Many_of
its
sojourners
were
devoted_to
seclusion
and
quiet
,
and
lived
there
to
the
end
of
their
days
.
It
was
the
haunt
of
writer
Ambrose_Bierce
,
who
admired
its
redwoods
.
Acorns
from
the
great
oaks
fed
the
small
black
pigs
(
akin
to
Berkshires
)
,
whose
``
carcass
sweepstakes
''
were
renowned
.
Their
ham
butts
,
cured
in
oak-log
smoke
,
were
also
esteemed
when
roasted
or
boiled
,
and
served
with
this
original
sauce
.
Put
into
a
saucepan
a
cupful
of
the
baked
ham
gravy
,
or
of
the
boiled
ham
liquor
,
with
a
half
stick
of
butter
,
three
teaspoonfuls
of
made
mustard
,
and
two
mashed
garlic_cloves
.
Contribute
also
an
onion
,
a
peeled
tomato
and
two
pickled
gherkins
,
and
a
mashed
lime
.
After
this
has
simmered
an
hour
,
add
two
tablespoons
each
of
Worcestershire
,
catsup
,
and
chutney
,
two
pickled
walnuts
,
and
a
pint
of
Sherry
.
Then
simmer
fifteen
minutes
longer
.
Every
winter
a
kegful
of_this
sauce
was
made
and
placed
at
the
end
of
a
row
of
four
other
kegs
in
the
cellar
,
so_that
when
its
turn
came
,
it
was
properly
mellowed
.
Vineyards
and
orchards
also
grew
around
Wright
's
,
and
deer
were
rather
a
nuisance
;
they
leaped
six-foot
fences
with
the
agility
of
panthers
.
But
no
one
complained
when
they
wound_up
,
regardless_of
season
,
in
venison
pies
.
No
one
complained
of
the
white_wine
either
:
at
this
altitude
of
two
thousand
feet
,
grapes
acquire
a
dryness
and
the
tang
of
gunflint
.
(
The
Almaden
vineyards
have
now
climbed
to
this
height
.
)
Apple
trees
grew
there
also
.
Though
creeks
in
the
Santa_Cruz
mountains
flow
brimful
the
year
round
and
it
is
forever
spring
,
the
apples
that
grow
there
have
a
wintry
crackle
.
Dwellers
thereabouts
preferred
to
get
their
apple_pies
at
the
local
bakery
,
which
had
a
brick
oven
fired
with
redwood
billets
.
The
merit
of
the
pie
,
Vernon
believed
,
was_due
more
to
its
making
than
to
the
waning
heat
of
the
oven
.
The
recipe
,
which
he
got
from
the
baker
,
and
wrote_down
in
his
ledger
,
is
basically
this
.
Peel
,
core
,
and
slice
across
enough
apples
to
make
a
dome
in
the
pie
tin
,
and
set_aside
.
In
a
saucepan
put
sufficient
water
to
cover
them
,
an
equal
amount
of
sugar
,
a
sliced
lemon
,
a
tablespoonful
of
apricot
preserve
or
jam
,
a
pinch
each
of
clove
and
nutmeg
,
and
a
large
bay_leaf
.
Let
this
boil
gently
for
twenty
minutes
,
then
strain
.
Poach
the
apples
in_this
syrup
for
twelve
minutes
,
drain
them
,
and
cool
.
Set
the
apples
in
the
pastry-lined
tin
,
spread
over
them
three
tablespoonfuls
of
softened
butter
,
with
as
much
brown_sugar
,
a
sprinkling
of
nutmeg
,
and
a
fresh
bay_leaf
,
then
lay
on
a
cover
of
pastry
,
and
gild
it
with
beaten
yolk
of
egg
.
