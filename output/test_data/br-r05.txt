Nothing
in
English
has
been
ridiculed
as_much_as
the
ambiguous
use
of
words
,
unless
it
be
the
ambiguous
use
of
sentences
.
Ben_Franklin
said
,
``
Clearly
spoken
,
Mr._Fogg
.
You
explain
English
by
Greek
''
.
Richard_Brinsley_Sheridan
said
,
``
I
think
the
interpreter
is
the
hardest
to
be
understood
of
the
two
''
.
And
a
witty
American
journalist
remarked
over
a
century
ago
what
is
even
more
true
today
,
``
Many_a
writer
seems
to
think
he
is
never
profound
except
when
he
can
n't
understand
his
own
meaning
''
.
There
are
many
types
of
ambiguity
and
many_of
them
have
been
described
by
rhetoricians
under
such
names
as
amphibology
,
parisology
,
and
other
ologies
.
In
common
parlance
they
would
be
described
as
misses
-
misinterpreters
,
misunderstanders
,
misdirectors
and
kindred
misdeeds
.
One
species
of
ambiguity
tries
to
baffle
by
interweaving
repetition
.
``
Did
you
or
did
you
not
say
what
I
said
you
said
,
because
Jane
said
you
never
said
what
I
said
''
?
Another
woman
,
addressing
Christmas_cards
,
said
to
her
husband
:
``
We
sent
them
one
last
year
but
they
did
n't
send
us
one
,
so
they
probably
won't
send
us
one
this
year
because
they
'll
think
we
won't
send
them
one
because
they
did
n't
last
year
,
do
n't
you
think
,
or
shall
we
''
?
Such
ambiguous
exercises
compound
confusion
by
making
it
worse
compounded
,
and
they
are
sometimes
expanded
until
the
cream
of
the
jest
sours
.
Ambiguity
of
a
non
repetitious
kind
describes
the
dilemma
one
girl
found
herself
in
.
``
I'm
terribly
upset
''
,
she
told
a
girl-friend
.
``
I
wrote
Bill
in
my
last
letter
to
forget
that
I
had
told
him
that
I
did
n't
mean
to
reconsider
my
decision
not
to
change
my
mind
-
and
he
seems
to
have
misunderstood
me
''
.
Evidently
Bill
was
another
of
those
men
who
simply
do
n't
understand
women
.
Another
case
involves
a
newspaper
reporter
who
tripped_up
a
politician
.
``
Mr._Jones
,
you
may
recall
that
we
printed
last
week
your
denial
of
having
retracted
the
contradiction
of
your
original
statement
.
Now
would
you
care
to
have
us
say
that
you
were
misquoted
in
regard_to
it
''
?
Questions
like
this
,
framed
in
verbal
fog
,
are
perhaps
the
only
kind
that
have
ever
stumped
an
experienced
politician
.
They
recall
Byron
's
classic
comment
:
``
I
wish
he
would
explain
his
explanation
''
.
Similarly
,
when
a
reporter
once
questioned
Lincoln
in
cryptic
fashion
,
Lincoln
refused
to
make
any
further
statement
.
``
I
fear
explanations
explanatory
of
things
explained
''
,
he
said
,
leaving
the
biter
bit
-
and
bitter
.
The
obscurity
of
politicians
may_not
always
be
as
innocent
as
it
looks
.
``
Senator
''
,
said
an
interviewer
,
``
your
constituents
can
n't
understand
from
your
speech
last
night
just
how
you
stand
on
the
question
''
.
``
Good
''
!
replied
the
Senator
.
``
It
took
me
five
hours
to
write
it
that
way
''
.
The
misplaced
modifier
is
another
species
more
honored
in
the
observance
of
obscurity
than
in
the
breach
.
This
creates
an
amusing
effect
because
its
position
in
a
sentence
seems
to
make
it
apply
to
the
wrong
word
.
A
verse
familiar
to
all
grammarians
is
the
quatrain
:
``
I
saw
a
man
once
beat
his
wife
When
on
a
drunken
spree
.
Now
can
you
tell
me
who
was
drunk
-
The
man
,
his
wife
,
or
me
''
?
The
``
wooden-leg
''
gag
of
vaudeville
,
another
standby
of
this
sort
,
had
endless
variations
.
``
''
There
's
a
man
outside
with
a
wooden_leg
named
Smith
``
.
''
What
's
the
name
of
his
other
leg
``
''
?
Another
stock
vaudeville
gag
ran
:
``
Mother
is
home
sick
in
bed
with
the
doctor
''
.
When
radio
came_in
,
it
continued
the
misplaced
modifier
in
its
routines
as
a
standard
device
.
``
''
Do
you
see
that
pretty
girl
standing
next
to
the
car
with
slacks
on
``
?
''
I
see
the
girl
but
I
do
n't
see
the
car
with
slacks
on
``
''
.
In
recent
years
gagwriters
have
discovered
this
brand
of
blunder
and
thus
the
misplaced
modifier
has
acquired
a
new
habitat
in
the
gagline
.
In
one
cartoon
a
family
is
shown
outside
a
theater
with
the
head
of
the
family
addressing
the
doorman
:
``
Excuse
me
,
but
when
we
came_out
we
found
that
we
had
left
my
daughter
's
handbag
and
my
wife
's
behind
''
.
Journalism
supplies
us
with
an
endless
run
of
such
slips
.
Not
long_ago
a
newspaper
advised
those
taking_part
in
a
contest
that
``
snapshots
must
be
of
a
person
not
larger
than
*
*
f
inches
''
.
Classified
ads
are
also
chockfull
of
misrelated
constructions
.
Readers
of
the
Reader_'s_Digest
are
familiar_with
such
items
which
often
appear
in
its
lists
of
verbal
slips
,
like
the
ad
in
a
California
paper
that
advertised
``
House
for
rent
.
View
takes_in
five
counties
,
two
bedrooms
''
.
Since
brevity
is
the
soul
of
ambiguity
as_well
as
wit
,
newspaper
headlines
continually
provide
us
with
amusing
samples
.
``
Officials
Meet
on
Rubbish
.
Many
Shapes
in
Bathtubs
.
Son
and
Daughter
of
Local
Couple
Married
''
.
Apart
from
misplaced
modifiers
and
headlinese
,
journalism
contributes
a
wide
variety
of
comic
ambiguities
in
both
editorial
and
advertising
matter
.
A
weekly
newspaper
reported
a
local
romance
:
``
and
the
couple
were
married
last
Saturday
,
thus
ending
a
friendship
which
began
in
their
schooldays
''
.
An
item
in
the
letters
column
of
a
newspaper
renewed
a
subscription
,
adding
:
``
I
personally
enjoy
your
newspaper
as_much_as
my
husband
''
.
Then
there
was
the
caterer
's
ad
which
read
:
``
Are
you
getting_married
or
having
an
affair
?
We
have
complete
facilities
to
accommodate
200
people
''
.
The
newspaper
too
is
the
favorite
habitat
of
the
anatomical
.
This
slip
is
so-called
because
its
semi
ambiguous
English
always
seems
to
refer
to
a
person
's
anatomy
but
never
quite
means
what
it
seems
to
say
.
Samples
:
He
walked
in
upon
her
invitation
.
She
kissed
him
passionately
upon
his
reappearance
.
He
kissed
her
back
.
Not
without
good
reason
has
the
anatomical
been
called
jocular
journalese
.
In
news
items
a
man
is
less
often
shot
in
the
body
or
head
than
in
the
suburbs
.
``
While
Henry_Morgan
was
escorting
Miss_Vera_Green
from
the
church
social
last
Saturday
night
,
a
savage
dog
attacked
them
and
bit
Mr._Morgan
on
the
public_square
''
.
Such
items
recall
the
California
journalist
who
reported
an
accident
involving
a
movie_star
:
``
The
area
in
which
Miss_N
-
was
injured
is
spectacularly
scenic
''
.
The
double
meaning
in
the
anatomical
made
it
a
familiar
vaudeville
device
,
as
in
the
gags
of
Weber
and
Fields
.
When
a
witness
at
court
was
asked
if
he
had
been
kicked
in
the
ensuing
rumpus
,
he
replied
,
``
No
,
it
was
in
the
stomach
''
.
Strangely_enough
,
this
always
brought_the_house_down
.
Apart
from
journalese
and
vaudeville
gags
,
the
anatomical
is
also
found
in
jocular
literature
.
A
conscientious
girl
became
the
secretary
of
a
doctor
.
Her
first
day
at
work
she
was
puzzled
by
an
entry
in
the
doctor
's
notes
on
an
emergency
case
.
It
read
:
``
Shot
in
the
lumbar
region
''
.
After
a
moment
of
thought
,
her
mind
cleared
and
,
in
the
interest
of
clarity
,
she
typed
into
the
record
:
``
Shot
in
the
woods
''
.
There
are
many
grammatical
misconstructions
other_than
dangling_modifiers
and
anatomicals
which
permit
two
different
interpretations
.
At
the
home
of
a
gourmet
the
new
maid
was
instructed
in
the
fine
points
of
serving
.
``
I
want
the
fish
served
whole
,
with
head
and
tail
''
,
the
epicure
explained
,
``
and
serve
it
with
lemon
in
mouth
''
.
The
maid
demurred
.
``
That
's
silly
-
lemon
in
mouth
''
,
she
said
.
But
since
the
gourmet
insisted
that
it
is
done
that
way
at_the_most
fashionable
dinners
,
the
girl
reluctantly
agreed
.
So
she
brought
the
fish
in
whole
,
and
she
carried
a
lemon
in
her
mouth
.
Another
specimen
of
such
double-entendre
is
illustrated
by
a
woman
in
a
department_store
.
She
said
to
the
saleslady
,
``
I
want
a
dress
to
put_on
around
the
house
''
.
The
puzzled
saleslady
inquired
,
``
How
large
is
your
house
,
Madam
''
?
This
saleslady
was
a
failure
in
the
dress
department
and
was
transferred
to
the
shoe
department
.
When
a
customer
asked
for
alligator
shoes
,
she
said
,
``
What
size
is
your
alligator
''
?
The
comic
indefinite
comprises
an
extensive
class
of
comedy
.
One
species
is
restricted
to
statements
which
are
neither
explicit
nor
precise
regarding
a
particular
person
,
place
,
time
or
thing
.
A
woman
met
a
famous
author
at
a
literary
tea
.
``
Oh
,
I'm
so
delighted
to
meet
you
''
,
she
gushed
.
``
It
was
only
the
other
day
that
I
saw
something
of
yours
,
about
something
or
other
,
in
some
magazine
''
.
This
baffling
lack
of
distinct
details
recalls
the
secretary
whose
employer
was
leaving
the
office
and
told
her
what
to
answer
if
anyone
called
in
his
absence
.
``
I
may
be
back
''
,
he
explained
,
``
and
then_again
,
I
may_not
''
.
The
girl
nodded
understandingly
.
``
Yes
,
sir
''
,
she
said
,
``
is
that
definite
''
?
An
old-fashioned
mother
said
to
her
modern
daughter
,
``
You
must
have
gotten_in
quite
late
last
night
,
dear
.
Where
were
you
''
?
The
daughter
replied
,
``
Oh
,
I
had
dinner
with
-
well
,
you
do
n't
know
him
but
he
's
awfully
nice
-
and
we
went_to
a_couple_of
places
-
I
do
n't
suppose
you
've
heard
of
them
-
and
we
finished_up
at
a
cute
little
night_club
-
I
forget
the
name
of
it
.
Why
,
it
's
all_right
,
is
n't
it
,
Mother
''
?
Her
woolly
minded
parent
agreed
.
``
Of_course
,
dear
''
,
she
said
.
``
It
's
only
that
I
like
to
know
where
you
go
''
.
No
less
ambiguous
was
the
indefinity
of
a
certain
clergyman
's
sermon
.
``
Dearly
beloved
''
,
he
preached
,
``
unless
you
repent
of
your
sins
in
a
measure
,
and
become
converted
to
a
degree
,
you
will
,
I
regret
to
say
,
be
damned
to
a
more_or_less
extent
''
.
This
clergyman
should
have
referred
to
Shakespeare
's
dictum
:
``
So-so
is
a
good
,
very
good
,
very
excellent
maxim
.
And
yet
it
is
not
.
It
is
but
so-so
''
.
Indefinite
reference
also
carries
double
meaning
where
an
allusion
to
one
person
or
thing
seems
to
refer
to
another
.
A
news
item
described
the
launching
of
a
ship
:
``
Completing
the
ceremony
,
the
beautiful
movie_star
smashed
a
bottle
of
champagne
over
her
stern
as
she
slid
gracefully
down
the
ways
into
the
sea
''
.
This
is
not
unlike
the
order
received
by
the
sergeant
of
an
army
motor_pool
:
``
Four
trucks
to
Fort_Mason
gym
,
7
:
30
tonight
,
for
hauling
girls
to
dance
.
The
bodies
must
be
cleaned
and
seats
wiped_off
''
.
A
politician
was
approached
by
a
man
seeking
the
office
of
a
minor
public
official
who
had
just
died
.
``
What
are
my
chances
for
taking
Joe
's
place
''
?
he
asked
.
``
If
you
can
fix
it
up
with
the
undertaker
''
,
returned
the
politician
,
``
it
's
all_right
with
me
''
.
The
manager
of
a
movie_theater
received
a
telephone_call
from
a
woman
who
was
equally
indefinite
.
``
What
have
you
got_on
today
''
?
she
inquired
.
``
A
blue
suit
''
,
he
answered
.
``
Who
's
in
it
''
?
she
continued
.
``
I
am
''
,
he
said
.
There
was
a
short
pause
for
reflection
.
``
Oh
''
,
said
the
woman
,
``
I
've
seen
that
picture
already
''
.
Another
brand
of
indefinite
reference
arises
out
of
the
use
of
the
double
verb
.
When
a
question
contains
two
verbs
,
the
response
does
not
make
clear
which
of
them
is
being
answered
.
The
moonlit
night
was
made_for
romance
,
and
he
had
been
looking
at
her
soulfully
for
some
time
.
Finally
he
asked
,
``
Do
you
object
to
petting
''
?
``
That
's
one
thing
I
've
never
done
''
,
she
said
promptly
.
He
thought
a
moment
,
then
inquired
,
``
You
mean
petted
''
?
``
No
''
,
she
smiled
,
``
objected
''
.
Replies
to
requests
for
character
reference
are
notorious
for
their
evasive
double-entendre
.
It
would
be
hard
to
find
anything
more
equivocal
than
:
``
I
cannot
recommend
him
too
highly
''
.
Another
less
ambiguous
case
read
as_follows
:
``
The
bearer
of_this
letter
has
served
me
for
two
years
to
his
complete
satisfaction
.
If
you
are
thinking_of
giving
him
a
berth
,
be
sure
to
make
it
a
wide
one
''
.
In
the
comedy
of
indefinite
reference
,
it
wit
occupies
a
prominent
place
because
of
its
frequent
occurrence
.
Ambiguity
arises
when
the
pronoun
it
carries
a
twofold
reference
.
Two
friends
were
talking
.
One
said
,
``
When
I
get
a
cold
I
buy
a
bottle
of
whiskey
for
it
,
and
within
a_few
hours
it
's
gone
''
.
The
speaker
referred
to
the
whiskey
but
his
friend
thought
he
meant
the
cold
.
It
wit
is
a
misnomer
because
it
covers
slips
as_well
as
wit
.
An
excited
woman
was
making
an
emergency
call
over
the
phone
:
``
Doctor
,
please
come
over
right_away
.
My
husband
is
in
great
pain
.
