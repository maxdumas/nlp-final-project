The
controversy
of
the
last
few
years
over
whether
architects
or
interior_designers
should
plan
the
interiors
of
modern
buildings
has
brought
clearly
into
focus
one
important
difference_of_opinion
.
The
architects
do
not
believe
that
the
education
of
the
interior_designer
is
sufficiently
good
or
sufficiently
extended
to
compare
with
that
of
the
architect
and
that
,
therefore
,
the
interior_designer
is
incapable
of
understanding
the
architectural
principles
involved
in
planning
the
interior
of
a
building
.
Ordinary
politeness
may
have
militated
against
this
opinion
being
stated
so
badly
but
anyone
with
a
wide
acquaintance
in
both
groups
and
who
has
sat
through
the
many
round_tables
,
workshops
or
panel_discussions
-
whatever
they
are
called
-
on
this
subject
will
recognize
that
the
final
,
boiled_down
crux_of_the_matter
is
education
.
It
is
true
that
most
architectural
schools
have
five
year
courses
,
some
even
have
six
or
more
.
The
element
of
public
danger
which
enters
so
largely
into
architectural
certification
,
however
,
would
demand
a
prolonged
study
of
structure
.
This
would
,
naturally
,
lengthen
their
courses
far
beyond
the
largely
esthetic
demands
of
interior_designer
's
training
.
We
may
then
dismiss
the
time
difference
between
these
courses
and
the
usual
four
year
course
of
the
interior_design
student
as
not
having
serious
bearing
on
the
subject
.
The
real
question
that
follows
is
-
how
are
those
four
years
used
and
what
is
their
value
as
training
?
The
American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers
has
published
a
recommended
course
for
designers
and
a
percentage
layout
of
such
a
course
.
An
examination
of
some
forty
catalogs
of
schools
offering
courses
in
interior_design
,
for_the_most_part
schools
accredited
by
membership
in
the
National_Association_of_Schools_of_Art
,
and
a
further
``
on_the_spot
''
inspection
of
a
number
of
schools
,
show
their
courses
adhere
pretty
closely
to
the
recommendations
.
One
or
two
of
the
schools
have
a
five
year
curriculum
,
but
the
usual
pattern
of
American
education
has
limited
most
of
them
to
the
four
year
plan
which
seems
to
be
the
minimum
in
acceptable
institutions
.
The
suggested
course
of
the
A.I.D.
was
based
on
the
usual
course
offered
and
on
the
opinion
of
many
educators
as
to
curricular
necessities
.
Obviously
,
the
four
year
provision
limits
this
to
fundamentals
and
much
desirable
material
must
be
eliminated
.
Without
comparing
the
relative
merits
of
the
two
courses
-
architecture
versus
interior_design
-
let
us
examine
the
educational
needs
of
the
interior_designer
.
To_begin_with
,
what
is
an
interior_designer
?
``
The_Dictionary_of_Occupational_Titles
''
published
by
the
U._S.
Department_of_Labor
describes
him
as_follows
:
``
Designs
,
plans
and
furnishes
interiors
of
houses
,
commercial
and
institutional
structures
,
hotels
,
clubs
,
ships
,
theaters
,
as_well_as
set_decorations
for
motion_picture
arts
and
television
.
Makes
drawings
and
plans
of
rooms
showing
placement
of
furniture
,
floor_coverings
,
wall
decorations
,
and
determines
color_schemes
.
Furnishes
complete
cost
estimates
for
clients
approval
.
Makes
necessary
purchases
,
places
contracts
,
supervises
construction
,
installation
,
finishing
and
placement
of
furniture
,
fixtures
and
other
correlated
furnishings
,
and
follows_through
to
completion
of
project
``
.
In_addition
to
this
the
U._S.
Civil_Service_Bureau
,
when
examining
applicants
for
government
positions
as
interior_designers
,
expects
that
``
when
various
needed
objects
are
not
obtainable
on
the
market
he
will
design
them
.
He
must
be
capable
of
designing
for
and
supervising
the
manufacture
of
any
craft
materials
needed
in
the
furnishings
''
.
This
seems
like
a
large_order
.
The
interior_designer
,
then
,
must
first
be
an
artist
but
also
understand
carpentry
and
painting
and
lighting
and
plumbing
and
finance
.
Yet
nobody
will
question
the
necessity
of
all
this
and
any
reputable
interior_designer
does
know
all
this
and
does
practice
it
.
And
further
he
must
understand
his
obligation
to
the
client
to
not_only
meet
his
physical
necessities
but
also
to
enhance
and
improve
his
life
and
to
enlarge
the
cultural
horizon
of
our
society
.
Few
will
quarrel
with
the
aim
of
the
schools
or
with
the
wording
of
their
curriculum
.
It
is
in
the
quality
of
the
teaching
of
all
this
that
a
question
may
arise
.
The
old
established
independent
art_schools
try
their
best
to
fulfill
their
obligations
.
Yet
even
here
many_a
problem
is
presented
;
as
in
a
recent
design
competition
with
a
floor_plan
and
the
simple
command
-
``
design
a
luxury
apartment
''
;
no
description
of
the
client
or
his
cultural
level
,
no
assertion
of
geographical_area
or
local
social
necessities
-
simply
``
a
luxury
apartment
''
.
Working
in
a
vacuum
of
minimal
information
can
result
only
in
show_pieces
that
look
good
in
exhibitions
and
catalogs
and
may
please
the
public_relations
department
but
have
little
to
do
with
the
essence
of
interior_design
.
It
is
possible
,
of_course
,
to
work_on
extant
or
projected
buildings
where
either
architect
or
owner
will
explain
their
necessities
so_that
the
student
may
get
``
the
feel
''
of
real
interior_design
demands
.
Unfortunately
,
the
purely
synthetic
problem
is
the
rule
.
It
is
like
medical_schools
in
India
where
,
in
that
fairy_land
of
religious
inhibition
,
the
dissection
of
dead_bodies
is
frowned_upon
.
Instead
they
learn
their
dissection
on
the
bulbs
of
plants
.
Thus
technical
efficiency
is
achieved
at
the
expense
of
actual
experience
.
In
the
earlier
years
of
training
certain
phases
of
the
work
must
be
covered
and
the
synthetic
problem
has
its
use
.
But
to
continue
to
divorce
advanced
students
from
reality
is
inexcusable
.
Consultation
with
architects
,
clients
,
real_estate
men
,
fabric
houses
and
furniture
companies
is
essential
to
the
proper
development
of
class
problems
just
as
in
actual
work
.
Fortunately
,
although
only
a_few
years
ago
they
held
the
student
at_arms_length
,
today
the
business
houses
welcome
the
opportunity
to
aid
the
student
,
not_only
from
an
increased
sense
of
community
responsibility
but
also
from
the
realization
that
the
student
of
today
is
the
interior_designer
of
tomorrow
-
that
the
student
already
is
``
in
the
trade
''
.
Even
the
``
history
of
furniture
''
can
hardly
be
taught
exclusively
from
photographs
and
lantern_slides
.
Here
,
too
,
the
reality
of
actual
furniture
must
be
experienced
.
The
professional
organizations
such_as
American_Institute_of_Interior_Designers
,
National_Society_of_Interior_Designers
,
Home_Fashions_League
and
various
trade
associations
,
can
and
do
aid
greatly
in
this
work
.
Certainly
every
educator
involved
in
interior_design
should
be
a
member
and
active
in
the
work
of
one
of
these
organizations
.
Not_only
should
every
educator
above
the
rank
of
instructor
be
expected
to
be
a
member
of
one
of
the
professional
organizations
,
but
his
first
qualification
for
membership
as
an
educator
should
be
so
sharply
scrutinized
that
membership
would
be
equivalent_to
certification
to
teach
the
subject
.
Participation
for
the
educator
in
this
case
,
however
,
would
have_to
be
raised
to
full
and
complete
membership
.
The
largest
of
these
organizations
at_present
denies
to
the
full_time
educator
any
vote
on
the
conduct
and
standards
of
the
group
and
,
indeed
,
refuses
him
even
the
right
to
attach
the
customary
initials
after
his
name
in
the
college
catalog
.
This
anomalous
status
of
the
educator
cannot
fail
to
lower
his
standing
in
the
eyes
of
the
students
.
The
professor
in_turn
dares
not
tolerate
the
influence
in
his
classes
of
an
organization
in
the
policies
and
standards
of
which
he
has
no
voice
.
This
seems
somewhat
shortsighted
since
if
the
absolute
educational
qualifications
for
membership
which
the
organizations
profess
are
ever
enforced
,
the
educator
will
have
the
molding
of
the
entire
profession
in
his
hands
.
In
one
way
the
Institutes
and
Societies
do
a
disservice
to
the
schools
.
That_is
in
the
continuance
of
the
``
grandfather_clauses
''
in
their
membership
requirements
.
When
these
groups
were
first
formed
many
prominent
and
accomplished
decorators
could
not
have
had
the
advantage
of
school
training
since
interior_design
courses
were
rare
and
undeveloped
during
their
youth
.
Long
hard
years
of
``
on_the_job
''
training
had
brought
them
to
their
competence
.
The
necessity
of
that
day
has
long
disappeared
.
There
is
plenty
of
opportunity
for
proper
education
today
.
It
is
discouraging
for
students
to
realize
that
the
societies
do
not
truly
uphold
the
standards
for
which
they
are
supposed
to
stand
.
The
reason
and
the
day
of
``
grandfather_clauses
''
has
long_since
passed
.
No
one
can
deny
that
these
``
back_door
''
admissions
to
membership
provisions
have
been
seriously
abused
nor
that
they
have
not
resulted
in
the
admission
of
downright
incompetents
to
membership
in
supposedly
learned
societies
.
Beyond
any
question
of
curriculum
and
approach
to
subject
must
be
the
quality
of
the
teachers
themselves
.
It
will
occur
to
anyone
that
the
teacher
must
have
adequate
education
,
a
depth
and
breadth
of
knowledge
far
beyond
the
immediate
necessities
of
his
course
plus
complete
dedication
to
his
subject
and
to
his
students
.
The
local
decorator
who
rushes
in
for
a_few
hours
of
teaching
may
but
more
likely
may_not
have
these
qualifications
.
Nor
will
the
hack
,
the
Jack-of-all-trades
,
still
found
in
some
of
the
smaller
art_schools
,
suffice
.
Only
a_few
years
ago
a
middle_western
college
circulated
a
request
for
a
teacher
of
interior_design
.
At
the
end
of
its
letter
was
the
information
that
applicants
for
this
position
``
must
also
be
prepared
to
teach
costume
design
and
advertising
art
''
.
This
kind
of
irresponsibility
toward
their
students
can
scarcely
build
a
strong
professional
attitude
in
the
future
designer
.
We
must
build
a
corps
of
highly
professional
teachers
of
interior_design
who
have
had
education
,
experience
in
the
profession
and
are
willing
to
take_on
the
usual
accompaniments
of
teaching
-
minimal
income
and
minimal
status
among
their
confreres
.
Considerable
specialization
in
teaching
subjects
such_as
architecture
,
furniture
design
,
textiles
and
color
is
also
desirable
.
In
all
``
degree
''
courses
in
interior_design
a
number
of
``
academic
''
or
``
general
studies
''
courses
are
included
.
It
is
only
fair
to
demand
that
teachers
of
courses
in
English
,
history
,
psychology
and_so_on
be
as
well
informed
in
matters
of
art
,
especially
interior_design
,
as
are
the
art_teachers
educated
in
the
academic
subjects
.
The
proper
correlation
of
the
art
with
the
academic
can
be
achieved
only_if
this
standard
is
observed
.
The
matter
of
sympathy
of
the
academic
professors
for
art
objectives
also
must
be
taken_into_account
.
One
technical
question
of
school
organization
comes_to_mind
here
.
For
proper
accreditation
of
schools
,
teachers
in
any
course
must
have
a
degree
at_least
one
level
above
that
for
which
the
student
is
a
candidate
.
Since
there
are
almost
no
schools
in
the
country
offering
graduate
work
in
interior_design
this
rule
cannot
at_present
be
observed
.
Indeed
,
it
has
only
been
a
matter
of
the
last
few
years
that
reputable
schools
of
art
have
granted
degrees
at_all
.
The
question
,
however
,
cannot
be
ignored
for
long
.
The
basic
problem
involved
is
that
a
college
setting_up
a
graduate_school
must
have
an
entirely
separate
faculty
for
the
advanced
degree
.
Most
professors
in
the
course
must
,
naturally
,
again
have
a
higher
degree
than
the
course
offers
.
One
solution
is
the
acquisition
of
degrees
in
education
but
it
is
a
poor
substitute
.
It
is
a
sort_of
academic
ring-around-a_rosy
and
you
solve
it
.
This
brings
us
to
the
question
of
accreditation
of
art_schools
in_general
.
Only
the
independent
art_schools
,
that_is
,
those
not
connected
with
any
university
or
college
,
receive
severe
and
separate
investigation
before
accreditation
by
the
various
regional
organizations
.
It
has
been
the
custom
for
most
universities
to
stretch_the_blanket
of
accreditation
for
their
liberal_arts
school
to
cover_the_shivering_body
of
their
fine_arts
department
.
This
,
plus
the
habit
of
many
schools
of
simply
adding
interior_design
to
the
many
subjects
of
their
home_economics
department
,
yet
,
nevertheless
,
claiming
that
they
teach
interior_design
,
has
contributed
to
the
low
repute
of
many
university
courses
in
interior_design
.
In_spite_of
this
,
many
universities
offer
adequate
and
even
distinguished
courses
in
the
subject
.
There
will
be
no
mitigation
of
these
offences
until
all
art_schools
,
whether
independent
or
attached
to
universities
have
separate
accreditation
-
as
do
medical_schools
-
by
an
art
accreditation
group
such_as
the
``
National_Association_of_Schools_of_Art
''
.
Independent
art_schools
granting
degrees
must
,
naturally
,
follow
this
with
academic
accreditation
by
the
appropriate
regional
group
.
