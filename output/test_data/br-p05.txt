The
Momoyama
family
had
come
from
Miyagi_Prefecture
,
in
the
northeast
of
the
main
Japanese
island
of
Honshu
,
where
there
are
still
traces
of
the
mysterious
Ainu
strain
.
The
Ainus
were
a
primitive
people
,
already
living
on
the
island
before
the
principal
ancestors
of
the
Japanese
came
from
Southern_Asia
.
Apparently
they
were
of
Caucasian
blood
.
They
had
white
skins
and
blue
eyes
;
all
their
men
were
bearded
,
and
many_of
their
women
were
beautiful
.
A
pitiful
few
of
them
are
left
now
,
to
subsist
mainly
on
the
tourist
trade
and
to
sing
their
ancient
tribal
chants
,
which
have
the
same
haunting
sadness
as
the
laments
of
the
American_Indians
.
Most_of
them
have
been
assimilated
,
but
sometimes
a
man
in
Miyagi
or
Akita
prefectures
is
much
more
hairy
than
the
average
Japanese
,
and
occasionally
a
girl
will
be
strikingly
lovely
,
her
coloring
warmed
and
improved
by
a_little
of
the
tawny
honey-in-the-sun
tint
of
the
invaders
from
the
South
.
Tommy_Momoyama
was
one
of
these
fortunate
occasions
.
She
was
taller
than
most
Japanese
girls
,
and
had
the
exquisitely
willowy
form
of
the
Japanese
girl
who
is
lucky
enough
to
be
tall
.
Her
nose
was
higher
of
bridge
,
her
complexion
so
pale
as
to
be
quite
susceptible_to
sunburn
,
and
the
fish
and
vegetable
diet
of
her
forebears
had
given
her
teeth
that
were
white
and
regular
and
strong
.
Her
mouth
,
soft
and
full
,
was
something
for
any
man
to
dream
about
.
She
had
black_eyes
,
long
and
intriguingly
tilted
,
and
the
way
she
walked
was
melody
.
She
had
been
in
Japan
just
one
week
.
It
was
an
alien
land
,
and
she
hated
it
intensely
;
she
was
already
considering
putting_in
rebellious
requests
for
duty
at
San_Diego
,
Bremerton
,
the
Great_Lakes
,
Pensacola
-
any
place
the
Navy
had
a
hospital
-
with
a
threat
to
resign
her
commission
if
the
request
were
not
granted
.
Anywhere
would
be
better
than
the
land
of
her
ancestors
.
There
was
nothing
wrong
with
her
job
.
Tommy
had
been
assigned
to
the
psychopathic
ward
.
There
were
no
depressingly
serious
cases
:
the
ward
doctor
sometimes
teamed_up
with
the
chaplain
to
serve
as
a
marriage
counselor
-
sometimes
the
Navy
sent
people
back
to
the
States
to
preserve
a
marriage
-
but
mental_health
as
a
rule
was
very
high
.
At_present
the
doctor
's
main
concern
was
in
seeing_to_it
that
Japanese
salvage
firms
were
not
permitted
to
operate
on
the
hulks
of
warships
sunk
too_close
inshore
,
because
the
work
involved
setting_off
nerve-shattering
blasts
at_all
hours
.
Tommy
was
interested
in
psychiatry
,
because
there
was
much
an
understanding
nurse
could
do
to
help
the
patients
.
But
she
suffered
in
her
off-duty
hours
.
Such_as
now
,
when
she
sat
at
a
table
in
the
coffee_shop
at
the
Officers
'
Club
,
having
coffee
and
a
hamburger
to
sustain
her
until
dinnertime
.
She
had
changed
into
a
cocktail_dress
,
and
the
whole
evening
should
have
been
before
her
,
but
already
she
was
beginning
to
get
a
tight
feeling
at
the
back
of
her
neck
.
This
was
one
of
the
Navy
's
crossroads
-
you
find
them
all_around
the
world
.
Ships
from
the
West_Coast
rotated
on
six-month
tours_of_duty
with
the
Seventh_Fleet
,
and
Yokosuka
was
the
Seventh_Fleet
's
principal
port
for
maintenance
,
upkeep
and
shore
liberty
.
Sooner_or_later
,
all
the
gray
Navy
ships
came_in
here
;
if
Tommy
sat
long
enough
,
she
would
be
sure
to
see
all
the
young
officers
she
had
met
in
San_Diego
and
Long_Beach
.
And
she
wanted
desperately
to
see
someone
she
had
known
back
there
.
She
felt
,
rather_than
saw
,
the
approach
of
the
good-looking
young_man
.
He
came_through
from
the
Fleet_Bar
,
which
was
stag
,
with
the
ice_cubes
tinkling
in
a
glass
he
carried
.
When
he
saw
Tommy
sitting
alone
,
the
tinkling
sound
stopped
.
He
was
perhaps
a_trifle
tipsy
,
having
been
long
at_sea
where
drinking
is
not
permitted
,
and
consequently
out_of_practice
;
he
wore
a
brown
tweed
sports_jacket
obviously
tailored
in
Hong_Kong
,
and
he
was
of
an
age
that
marked
him
as
a
lieutenant
.
Probably
off
one
of
the
carriers
-
an
aviator
.
There
was
a
fifty-fifty
chance
,
perhaps
,
that
he
would
be
unmarried
,
and
an
even
more
slender
chance
that
his
approach
would
be
different
.
Japan
did
something
to_a_man
-
and
it
was
n't
just
Japan
,
either
,
because
the
same
thing
applied
anywhere
overseas
.
It
was
as
if
foreign
duty
implied
and
excused
license
;
it
intimated
that
the
folks
at_home
would
never
know
about
it
,
and
,
therefore
,
why
not
?
Then
the
young_man
in
the
brown
sports_jacket
spoke
,
and
it
was
no
different
.
``
Harro
,
girl-san
''
!
he
said
,
turning_on
what
was
meant
to
be
charm
.
``
You
catchee
boy-furiendo
?
Maybe
you
likee
date
with
me
''
?
``
I
beg_your_pardon
''
!
Tommy
said
out
of
her
cold
rage
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
I
know
you
,
and
I
can
n't
understand
your
quaint
brand
of
English
-
it
was
meant
to
be
English
,
was
n't
it
''
?
The
nice-looking
young
officer
fell_back
on
his
heels
,
open-mouthed
and
blushing
.
At_least
,
he
had
the
decency
to
blush
,
she
thought
.
``
Oh
-
I
'm
sorry
!
You
see
,
I
thought
-
I
mean
I
really
had
no
idea
''
-
``
Oh
,
yes
-
you
had
ideas
''
!
Tommy
interrupted
furiously
.
``
All
wrong
ones
''
!
Then
she
jerked
her
thumb
toward
the
door
in
a
very
American
gesture
,
and
dropped
into
Navy
slang
.
``
Take_off
,
fly-boy
''
!
``
Uh
-
sorry
''
!
he
muttered
,
and
took_off
,
obviously
feeling
like
a
fool
.
The
trouble
was
that
there
was
no
lasting
satisfaction
in_this
for
Tommy
.
She
felt
like
a
fool
,
too
.
It
had
n't
been
this
way
in
college
,
or
in
nurses
'
training
;
it
was
n't
this
way
in
the
hospital
at
San_Diego
.
Everybody
had
accepted
her
for
what
she
was
-
a
very
charming
girl
.
Nobody
had
addressed
her
in
broken
English
at
any
of
those
places
,
nobody
had
suggested
that
she
was
n't
American
.
There
are
Spanish
girls
who
look_like
Tommy_Momoyama
,
brunettes
with
a
Moorish
hint
of
the
Orient
in
their
faces
;
there
are
beauties
from
the
Balkan_states
who
are
similarly
endowed
,
and
-
back
in
the
blessed
United_States
-
they
were
regarded
simply
as
pretty
women
.
Now
,
having
been
sent
halfway
around
the
world
on
a
job
she
had
not
asked
for
,
Tommy
was
being
humiliated
at
every
turn
.
She
looked_around
,
self-consciously
.
Four
little
Japanese
waitresses
were
murdering
the_English
language
at
the
counter
-
Yuki_Kobayashi
happened
to
be
one
of
them
.
Everybody
but
Tommy
seemed
to
think
it
was
charming
when
they
called
,
``
Bifutek-san
''
!
for
a
steak
sandwich
,
or
``
Kohi
futotsu
''
!
for
one
cup
of
coffee
.
Two
other
Japanese
girls
were
sitting
at
the
tables
,
both
quite
pretty
and
well
groomed
.
One
was
with
a
whitehaired
and
doting
lieutenant_commander
;
the
other
was
with
her
American
husband
and
their
exceptionally
appealing
children
.
Seeing
these
did_nothing
for
Tommy
's
mood
.
She
told
herself
rebelliously
,
and
with_pride
,
I
am
an
American
!
And
so
she
was
,
and
would
remain
.
But
she
was
learning
that
so_long
as
she
was
in_this
country
,
and
wore
civilian_dress
in
the
Club
,
there
would
always
be
transient
young_men
who
would
approach
her
with
broken
English
.
There
had
been
occasions
when
some
of
the
more
experienced
had
even
addressed
her
in_what
might
have
been
perfectly
good
Japanese
.
Tommy
would
n't
know
;
after
coming
to
America
,
her
parents
had
spoken
only
English
.
One
thing
was
becoming
increasingly
sure
.
She
had
been
sent
to
the
wrong
place
for
duty
.
There
was
more
to
service
in
the
Navy_Nurse_Corps
than
the
hours
in
the
ward
.
One
had_to
have
friends
,
and
a
congenial
life
in
after-duty
hours
.
Now
there
was
raucous
male
singing
from
the
Fleet_Bar
.
It
was
terribly
off
key
,
and
poorly
done
,
and
Tommy
could
never
admit
to
herself
that
male
companionship
was
a
very
natural
and
important
thing
,
but
all_at_once
she
felt
lonesome
and
put-upon
.
She
finished
her
hamburger
and
drank
her
coffee
and
paid
her
check
;
she
got_out
of
the
coffee_shop
before
the
incident
could
be
repeated
.
Eating
while
angry
had
given
her
a
slight
indigestion
.
Back
in
her
living_quarters
at
the
hospital
she
took
bicarbonate_of_soda
,
and
sulked
.
Then
,
after
a
while
,
she
went
to
her
mirror
.
It
was
all
true
.
She
certainly
looked
Japanese
,
and
perhaps
she
could
not
really
blame
the
young_men
.
And
,
still
,
they
did
not
have_to
be
so
crude
in
their
approach
.
There
was
a
letter
to
write
to
her
mother
,
and
she
tried
to
make
its
tone
cheerful
.
She
promised
that
she
would
soon
take
a_few
day
's
leave
and
visit
the
uncle
she
had
never
seen
,
on
the
island
of
Oyajima
-
which
was
not
very
far
from
Yokusuka
.
And
tomorrow
she
would
take
time
to
shop
for
the
kimono
her
mother
wanted
to
present
to
the
young
wife
of
a
faculty_member
as
a
hostess
gown
.
Tommy
,
of_course
,
had
never
heard
of
a
kotowaza
,
or
Japanese
proverb
,
which
says
,
``
Tanin
yori
miuchi
''
,
and
is
literally
translated
as
``
Relatives
are
better
than
strangers
''
.
Actually
,
this
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
blood
is
thicker
than
water
.
Doc_Doolittle
's
scheduled
appearance
at
captain
's
mast
was
a
very
unusual
thing
,
because
the
discipline
dispensed
there
is
ordinarily
for
the
young
and
immature
,
and
a
chief
is
naturally
expected
to
stay
off
the
report
.
But
the
beer
hall
riot
in
Subic
had
been
unusual
,
too
,
and
Walt_Perry
was
convinced
that
Doc
had
started
it
through
some
expert
tactics
in
rabble
rousing
.
Just
why
anybody
should
wish
to
start
a
riot
the
executive_officer
did
n't
know
.
In
his
opinion
,
Doc
had
not
grown_up
.
The
lieutenant
was
not
entirely
wrong
in
the
belief
.
There
had
never
been
a
good
reason
for
Doc_Doolittle
to
grow_up
.
He
had
come
into
the
Navy
too
young
,
with
the
image
of
the
fun-loving
Guns
Appleby
before
him
.
The
war
found
him
much
too
early
,
and
its
perils
-
and
especially
its
awful
boredom
-
were
best
forgotten
in
horseplay
and
elaborate
practical_jokes
,
and
even
now
Doc
had
never
found
any
stabilizing
,
sobering
influence
.
He
remained
young
at_heart
,
with
an
overdeveloped
sense_of_humor
.
He
wisecracked
about
the
captain
's
indoctrination
of
new
men
,
took
great
delight
in
slaughtering
cockroaches
with
ethyl
chloride
,
and
gave
no
thought
for
tomorrow
.
He
was
doing
thirty
years
,
and
the
Navy
would
take
care
of
him
.
The
job
security
enjoyed
by
Doc_Doolittle
,
and
nearly
all
members
of
the
Armed_Forces
,
is
a
wonderful
thing
.
Actually
,
all
a
man
in
uniform
has_to
do
is
to
get_by
.
He
may_not
rise
to
the
heights
,
but
he
can
get_by
,
and
eventually
be
retired
.
Doc
had
been
under
restriction
to
the
ship
since
the
Bustard
left
Subic
.
This
deprived
him
of
liberty
in
Hong_Kong
,
but
he
told
Boats
McCafferty
that
Hong_Kong
was
a
book
he
had
read
before
,
and
the
Navy
would
always
bring
him
there
again
,
some_day
.
At
Yokosuka
he
was
restricted
to
the
confines
of
the
Base
because
Walt_Perry
,
being
thoughtful
,
knew
that
Doc
might
have_to
draw
some
medical
supplies
from
the
hospital
or
the
Supply_Base
.
This
gave
Doc
the
whole
range
of
the
naval
establishment
,
and
suited
him
quite
well
.
There
were
two
things
he
wanted
to
do
:
inspect
one
of
the
many
caves
that
had
been
dug
into
the
hills
on
the
Naval_Base
,
and
visit
an
old
shipmate
.
A
telephone_line
had
been
hooked_up
to
connect
the
ship
with
the
Base
exchange
.
After
supper
,
Doc
called
Whitey_Gresham
,
who
was
now
a
lieutenant
and
had
a
family
.
``
Well
,
Doc
,
you
old
sonofabitch
''
!
Whitey
exclaimed
,
with
true
affection
.
``
Come
over
and
have
a
drink
.
We
live
down
by
the
Base
commissary
.
Grab
a
taxi
''
.
``
I
'll
be
there
,
but
I
'll
walk
''
,
Doc
said
.
``
I
've
got_to
run
an
errand
on_the_way
.
See
you
in
about
an
hour
''
.
He
threw
a
smart
salute
at
the
gangway
,
went
up
the
dock
,
and
turned
down
the
wide
street
in_front
of
the
Petty_Officers
'
Club
.
