Was
it
love
?
I
had
no_doubt
that
it
was
.
During
the
rest
of
the
summer
my
scholarly
mania
for
making
plaster_casts
and
spatter
prints
of
Catskill
flowers
and
leaves
was
all_but
surpassed
by
the
constantly
renewed
impressions
of
Jessica
that
my
mind
served_up
to
me
for
contemplation
and
delight
.
Nothing
in_all
the
preceding
years
had
had
the
power
to
bring
me
closer
to
a
knowledge
of
profound
sorrow
than
the
breakup
of
camp
,
the
packing
away
of
my
camp
uniforms
,
the
severing
of
ties
with
the
six
or
ten
people
I
had
grown
most
to
love
in
the
world
.
In
final
separation
from
them
,
in
the
railroad_terminal
across
the
river
from
New_York
,
I
would
nearly
cry
.
My
parents
'
welcoming
arms
would
seem
woeful
,
inadequate
,
unwanted
.
But
that
year
was
different
,
for
just
as
the
city
,
in
the
form
of
my
street
clothes
,
had
intruded
upon
my
mountain
nights
,
so
an
essential
part
of
the
summer
gave
promise
of
continuing
into
the
fall
:
Jessica
and
I
,
about
to
be
separated
not
by
a
mere
footbridge
or
mess-hall
kitchen
but
by
the
immense
obstacle
of
residing
in
cruelly
distant
boroughs
,
had
agreed
to
correspond
.
These
letters
became
the
center
of
my
existence
.
I
lived
to
see
an
envelope
of
hers
in
the
morning
mail
and
to
lock
myself
in
my
room
in
the
afternoon
to
reread
her
letter
for
the
tenth
time
and
finally
prepare
an
answer
.
My
memory
has
catalogued
for
easy
reference
and
withdrawal
the
image
of
her
pink
,
scented
stationery
and
the
unsloped
,
almost
printed
configurations
of
her
neat
,
studious
handwriting
with
which
she
invited
me
to
recall
our
summer
,
so
many
sentences
beginning
with
``
Remember
when
''
;
and_others
concerning
camp
friends
who
resided
in
her
suburban
neighborhood
,
and
news
of
her
commencing
again
her
piano_lessons
,
her
private_school
,
a
visit
to
Boston
to
see
her
grandparents
and
an
uncle
who
was
a
surgeon
returned
on
furlough
,
wounded
,
from
the
war
in
Europe
.
In
my
letters
I
took_on
a
personality
that
differed
from
the
self
I
knew
in
real_life
.
Then
epistolatory
me
was
a
foreign
correspondent
dispatching
exciting
cables
and
communiques
,
full
of
dash
and
wit
and
glamor
,
quoting
from
the
books
I
read
,
imitating
the
grand
styles
of
the
authors
recommended
by
a
teacher
in
whose
special
,
after_school
class
I
was
enrolled
.
The
letters
took
their
source
from
a
stream
of
my
imagination
in
which
I
was
transformed
into
a
young_man
not
unlike
my
bunkmate
Eliot_Sands
-
he
of
the
porch
steps
anecdotes
-
who
smoked
cigarettes
,
performed
the
tango
,
wore
fifty
dollar
suits
,
and
sneaked_off
into
the
dark
with
girls
to
do
unimaginable
things
with
them
.
Like
Eliot
,
in
my
fantasies
,
I
had
a
proud
bearing
and
,
with
a
skill
that
was
vaguely
continental
,
I
would
lead
Jessica
through
an
evening
of
dancing
and
handsome
descriptions
of
my
newest
exploits
,
would
guide
her
gently
to
the
night
's
climax
which
,
in
my
dreams
,
was
always
represented
by
our
almost
suffocating
one
another
to
death
with
deep
,
moist
kisses
burning
with
love
.
The
night
after
reading
her
letter
about
her
surgeon
uncle
-
it
must
have
been
late
in
September
-
I
had
a
vision
of
myself
returned
in
ragged
uniform
from
The
Front
,
nearly
dying
,
my
head
bandaged
and
bloody
,
and
Jessica
bending
over
me
,
the
power
of
her
love
bringing
me
back
to
life
.
For
many
nights
afterward
,
the
idea
of
her
having
been
so
close
to
me
in_that
imagined
bed
would
return
and
fill
me
with
obscure
and
painful
desires
,
would
cause
me
to
lie_awake
in
shame
,
tossing
with
irresolution
,
longing
to
fall
into
a
deep
sleep
.
The
weeks
went_by
,
and
the
longer
our
separation
grew
,
the
more
unbounded
and
almost
unbearable
my
fantasies
became
.
They
caused
my
love
for
Jessica
to
become
warmer
and
at_the_same_time
more
hopeless
,
as
if
my
adolescent
self
knew
that
only
torment
would
ever
bring
me
the
courage
to
ask
to
see
her
again
.
As
it
turned_out
,
Jessica
took
matters
into
her
own
hands
.
Having
received
permission
to
give
a
camp
reunion
Halloween
party
,
she
asked
that
I
come
and
be
her
date
.
I
went
and
,
mum
and
nervous
,
all_but
made
a
fool
of
myself
.
Again
among
those
jubilantly
reunited
bunkmates
,
I
was
shy
with
Jessie
and
acted
as
I
had
during
those
early
Saturday
mornings
when
we
all
seemed
to
be
playing_for_effect
,
to
be
detached
and
unconcerned
with
the
girls
who
were
properly
our
dates
but
about
whom
,
later
,
in
the
privacy
of
our
bunks
,
we
would
think
in_terms_of
the
most
elaborate
romance
.
I
remember
standing
in
a
corner
,
watching
Jessica
act
the
hostess
,
serving
soft_drinks
to
her
guests
.
She
was
wearing
her
dark
hair
in
two
,
thick
braids
to
attain
an
``
American_Girl
''
effect
she
thought
was
appropriate
to
Halloween
.
It
made
her
look
sweet
and
schoolgirlish
,
I
was
excited
to
be
with
her
,
but
I
did
not
know
how
to
express
it
.
Yet
a
moment
did
come
that
night
when
the
adventurous
letter_writer
and
fantasist
seemed
to
stride
off
my
flashy
pages
,
out
of
my
mind
,
and
plant
himself
in
reality
.
It
was
late
,
we
were
playing
kissing
games
,
and
Jessica
and
I
called_on
to
kiss
in_front_of
the
others
.
We
blushed
and
were
flustered
,
and
it
turned_out
to
be
the
fleetest
brush
of
lips
upon
cheek
.
The
kiss
outraged
our
friends
but
it
was
done
and
meanwhile
had
released
in
me
all
the
remote
,
exciting
premonitions
of
lust
,
all
the
mysterious
sensations
that
I
had
imagined
a
truly
consummated
kiss
would
convey
to
me
.
It
was
at
that
party
that
,
finally
overcoming
my
timidity
,
inspired
by
tales
only
half
understood
and
overheard
among
older
boys
,
I
asked
Jessie
to
spend
New_Year's_Eve
with
me
.
Lovingly
,
she
accepted
,
and
so
great
was
my
emotion
that
all
I
could
think_of
saying
was
,
``
You
're
amazing
,
you_know
''
?
Later
,
we
agreed
to
think_of
how
we
wished
to
spend
that
night
.
We
would
write
to
one
another
and
make
a
definite
plan
.
She
was
terribly
pleased
.
Among
my
school
and
neighborhood
friends
,
during
the
next
months
,
I
bragged
and
swaggered
and
pompously
described
my
impending
date
.
But
though
I
boasted
and
gave_off
a
dapper
front
,
I
was
beneath_it_all
frightened
.
It
would
be
the
first
time
I
had
ever
been
completely
alone
with
a
girl
I
loved
.
I
had
no
idea
of_what
subjects
one
discussed
when
alone
with
a
girl
,
or
how
one
behaved
:
Should
I
hold
her
hand
while
walking
or
only
when
crossing
the
street
?
Should
I
bring
along
a
corsage
or
send
one
to
her
?
Was
it
preferable
to
meet
her
at
home
or
in
the
city
?
Should
I
accompany
her
to
the
door
of
her
home
,
or
should
I
ask
to
be
invited
in
?
In
or
out
,
should
I
kiss
her
good-night
?
All
this
was
unknown
to
me
,
and
yet
I
had
dared
to
ask
her
out
for
the
most
important
night
of
the
year
!
When
in
one
letter
Jessica
informed
me
that
her
father
did
not
like
the
idea
of
her
going_out
alone
on
New_Year's_Eve
,
I
knew
for
a
moment
an
immense
relief
;
but
the
letter
went_on
:
she
had
cried
,
she
had
implored
,
she
had
been
miserable
at
his
refusal
,
and
finally
he
had
relented
-
and
now
how
happy
she
was
,
how
expectant
!
Her
optimism
gave
me
heart
.
I
forced
confidence
into
myself
.
I
made
inquiries
,
I
read
a
book
of
etiquette
.
In
December
I
wrote
her
with_authority
that
we
would
meet
on
the
steps
of
the
Hotel_Astor
,
a
rendezvous
spot
that
I
had
learned
was
the
most
sophisticated
.
We
would
attend
a
film
and
,
later_on
,
I
stated
,
we
might
go
to
the
Mayflower_Coffee_Shop
or
Child
's
or
Toffenetti
's
for
waffles
.
I
set
the
hour
of
our
meeting
for
seven
.
At
five
o'clock
that
night
it
was
already
dark
,
and
behind
my
closed
door
I
was
dressing
as
carefully
as
a
groom
.
I
wore
a
new
double-breasted
brown
worsted
suit
with
a
faint
herringbone
design
and
wide
lapels
like
a
devil
's
ears
.
My
camp
made
leather
wallet
,
bulky
with
twisted
,
raised
stitches
around
the
edges
,
I
stuffed
with
money
I
had
been
saving
.
Hatless
,
in
an
overcoat
of
rough
blue
wool
,
I
was
given
a
proud
farewell
by
my
mother
and
father
,
and
I
set_out
into
the
strangely
still
streets
of
Brooklyn
.
I
felt
superior
to
the
neighborhood
friends
I
was
leaving_behind
,
felt
older
than
my
years
,
and
was
full
of
compliments
for
myself
as
I
headed
into
the
subway
that
was
carrying
its
packs
of
passengers
out
of_that
dull
borough
and
into
the
unstable
,
tantalizing
excitement
of
Manhattan
.
Times_Square
,
when
I
ascended
to_it
with
my
fellow
subway
travellers
(
all
dressed
as
if
for
a
huge
wedding
in
a
family
of
which
we
were
all
distant
members
)
,
was
nearly
impassable
,
the
sidewalks
swarming_with
celebrants
,
with
bundled_up
sailors
and
soldiers
already
hugging
their
girls
and
their
rationed
bottles
of
whiskey
.
Heavy_coated
,
severe
looking
policemen
sat
astride
noble
horses
along
the
curbside
to
prevent
the
revellers
from
spilling_out
in_front
of
the
crawling
traffic
.
The
night
was
cold
but
the
crowd
kept
one
warm
.
The
giant
electric
signs
and
marquees
were
lit_up
for_the_first_time
since
blackout
regulations
had
been
instituted
,
and
the
atmosphere
was
alive
with
the
feeling
that
victory
was
just
around_the_corner
.
Cardboard
noisemakers
,
substitutes
for
the
unavailable
tin
models
,
were
being
hawked
and
bought
at
makeshift
stands
every
few
yards
along
Broadway
,
and
one
's
ears
were
continually
serenaded
by
the
horns
'
rasps
and
bleats
.
An
old
gentlemen
next
to
me
held
a
Boy_Scout
bugle
to
his
lips
and
blasted
away
at
every
fourth
step
and
during
the
interim
shouted_out
,
``
V
for
Victory
''
!
His
neighbors
cheered
him
on
.
There
was
a
great
sense
of
camaraderie
.
How
did
one
join
them
?
Where
were
they
all
walking
to
?
Was
I
supposed
to
buy
a
funny
hat
and
a
rattle
for
Jessica
?
It
was
a
quarter
of
seven
when
the
crowd
washed_me_up
among
the
other
gallants
who
had
established
the
Astor
steps
as
the
beach-head
from
which
to
launch
their
night
of
merrymaking
.
I
looked
over
their
faces
and
felt
a
twinge
:
they
all
looked
so
much
more
knowing
than
I
.
I
looked_away
.
I
looked_for
Jessica
to
materialize
out
of
the
clogging
,
curdling
crowd
and
,
as
the
time
passed
and
I
waited
,
a
fiend
came_to_life
beside
me
and
whispered
in
my
ear
:
How
was
I
planning
to
greet
Jessica
?
Where
exactly
would
we
go
after
the
movie
?
Suppose
the
lines
in_front_of
the
movie_houses
were
too
long
and
we
could
n't
get_in
?
Suppose
I
had
n't
brought
along
enough
money
?
I
felt
for
my
wallet
.
Its
thick
,
substantial
outline
calmed
me
.
But
when
I
saw
that
it
was
already
ten
past
seven
,
I
began
to
wonder
if
something
had
gone_wrong
.
Suppose
her
father
had
changed
his
mind
and
had
refused
to
let
her
leave
?
Suppose
at
this
very
moment
her
father
was
calling
my
house
in
an
effort
to
cancel
the
plans
?
I
grew
uneasy
.
All
about
me
there
was
a
hectic
interplay
of
meetings
taking_place
,
like
abrupt
,
jerky
scenes
in
old
silent_movies
,
joyous
greetings
and
beginnings
,
huggings
and
kissings
,
enthusiastic
forays
into
the
festive
night
.
Whole
platoons
were
taking_up
new
positions
on
the
steps
,
arriving
and
departing
,
while
I
stayed
glued
,
like
a
signpost
,
to
one
spot
.
At
7
:
25
two
hotel
doormen
came
thumping
down
the
steps
,
carrying
a
saw-horse
to
be
set_up
as
a
barricade
in_front_of
the
haberdashery_store
window
next
to
the
entranceway
,
and
as
I
watched
them
in
their
gaudy
red
coats
that
nearly
scraped
the
ground
,
their
golden
,
fringed
epaulets
and
spic
,
red
visored
caps
,
I
suddenly
saw
just
over
their
shoulders
Jessica
gracefully
making
her
way
through
the
crowd
.
My
heart
almost
stopped
beating
.
