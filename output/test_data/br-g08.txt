Nostalgic
Yankee
readers
of
Erskine_Caldwell
are
today
informed
by
proud
Georgians
that
Tobacco_Road
is
buried
beneath
a
four-lane
super
highway
,
over
which
travel
each_day
suburbanite
businessmen
more
concerned
with
the
Dow-Jones
average
than
with
the
cotton
crop
.
Thus
we
are
compelled
to
face
the
urbanization
of
the
South
-
an
urbanization
which
,
despite
its
dramatic
and
overwhelming
effects
upon
the
Southern
culture
,
has
been
utterly
ignored
by
the
bulk
of
Southern
writers
.
Indeed
,
it
seems
that
only
in
today
's
Southern
fiction
does
Tobacco_Road
,
with
all
the
traditional
trimmings
of
sowbelly
and
cornbread
and
mint_juleps
,
continue
to
live
-
but
only
as
a
weary
,
overexploited
phantom
.
Those
writers
known
collectively
as
the
``
Southern
school
''
have
received
accolades
from
even
those
critics
least
prone
to
eulogize
;
according
to
many
critics
,
in_fact
,
the
South
has
led
the
North
in
literature
since
the
Civil_War
,
both
quantitatively
and
qualitatively
.
Such
writers
as
William_Faulkner
and
Robert_Penn_Warren
have
led
the
field
of
somewhat
less
important
writers
in
a
sort_of
post-bellum
renaissance
.
It
is
interesting
,
however
,
that
despite
this
strong
upsurge
in
Southern
writing
,
almost
none
of
the
writers
has
forsaken
the
firmly
entrenched
concept
of
the
white-suited
big-daddy
colonel
sipping
a
mint_julep
as
he
silently
recounts
the
revenue
from
the
season
's
cotton
and
tobacco
crops
;
of
the
stereotyped
Negro
servants
chanting
hymns
as
they
plow
the
fields
;
of
these
and
a
host
of
other
antiquated
legends
that
deny
the
South
its
progressive
leaps
of
the
past
century
.
This
is
not
to
say
that
the
South
is
no_longer
agrarian
;
such
a
statement
would
be
the
rankest
form
of
oversimplification
.
But
the
South
is
,
and
has
been
for
the
past
century
,
engaged
in
a
wide-sweeping
urbanization
which
,
oddly_enough
,
is
not
reflected
in
its
literature
.
In
1900
the
South
was
only
15
%
urban
;
in
1950
it
had
become
47.1
%
urban
.
In
a
mere
half-century
the
South
has
more_than
tripled
its
urban
status
.
There
is
a
New_South
emerging
,
a
South
losing
the
folksy
traditions
of
an
agrarian
society
with
the
rapidity
of
an
avalanche
-
especially
within
recent
decades
.
As
the
New_South
snowballs
toward
further
urbanization
,
it
becomes
more_and_more
homogeneous
with
the
North
-
a
tendency
which
Willard_Thorp
terms
``
Yankeefication
''
,
as
evidenced
in
such
cities
as
Charlotte
,
Birmingham
,
and
Houston
.
It
is
said
that
,
even
at
the
present
stage
of
Southern
urbanization
,
such
a
city
as
Atlanta
is
not
distinctly
unlike
Columbus
or
Trenton
.
Undoubtedly
even
the
old
Southern
stalwart
Richmond
has
felt
the
new
wind
:
William_Styron
mentions
in
his
latest
novel
an
avenue
named
for
Bankhead_McGruder
,
a
Civil_War
general
,
now
renamed
,
in
typical
California
fashion
,
``
Buena_Vista_Terrace
''
.
The
effects
of
television
and
other
mass_media
are
erasing
regional
dialects
and
localisms
with
a
startling
force
.
As
for
progress
,
the
``
backward
South
''
can
boast
of
Baton_Rouge
,
which
increased
its
population
between
1940
and
1950
by
two
hundred
and
sixty-two
percent
,
to
126000
,
the
second
largest
growth
of
the
period
for
all
cities
over
25000
.
The
field
,
then
,
is
ripe
for
new
Southerners
to
step_to_the_fore
and
write_of
this
twentieth-century
phenomenon
,
the
Southern_Yankeefication
:
the
new
urban
economy
,
the
city-dweller
,
the
pains
of
transition
,
the
labor
problems
;
the
list
is
,
obviously
,
endless
.
But
these
sources
have
not
been
tapped
.
Truman_Capote
is
still
reveling
in
Southern_Gothicism
,
exaggerating
the
old
Southern
legends
into
something
beautiful
and
grotesque
,
but
as
unreal
as
-
or
even
more
unreal
than
-
yesterday
.
William_Styron
,
while
facing
the
changing
economy
with
a
certain
uneasy
reluctance
,
insists
he
is
not
to
be
classified
as
a
Southern
writer
and
yet
includes
traditional
Southern
concepts
in
everything
he
publishes
.
Even
the
great
god
Faulkner
,
the
South
's
one
probable
contender
for
literary
immortality
,
has
little
concerned
himself
with
these
matters
;
such
are
simply
not
within
his
bounded
province
.
Where
are
the
writers
to
treat
these
changes
?
Has
the
agrarian
tradition
become
such
an
addiction
that
the
switch
to
urbanism
is
somehow
dreaded
or
unwanted
?
Perhaps
present
writers
hypnotically
cling_to
the
older
order
because
they
consider
it
useful
and
reliable
through
repeated
testings
over
the
decades
.
Lacking
the
pioneer
spirit
necessary
to
write_of
a
new
economy
,
these
writers
seem
to
be
contenting
themselves
with
an
old
one
that
is
now
as
defunct
as
Confederate
money
.
An
example
of
the
changes
which
have
crept
over
the
Southern
region
may
be
seen
in
the
Southern_Negro
's
quest
for
a
position
in
the
white-dominated
society
,
a
problem
that
has
been
reflected
in
regional
fiction
especially
since
1865
.
Today
the
Negro
must
discover
his
role
in
an
industrialized
South
,
which
indicates
that
the
racial
aspect
of
the
Southern
dilemma
has
n't
changed
radically
,
but
rather
has
gradually
come
to
be
reflected
in_this
new
context
,
this
new
coat_of_paint
.
The
Negro
faces
as
much
,
if_not
more
,
difficulty
in
fitting
himself
into
an
urban
economy
as
he
did_in
an
agrarian
one
.
This
represents
a
gradual
change
in
an
ever-present
social
problem
.
But
there
have
been
abrupt_changes
as_well
:
the
sit-ins
,
the
picket_lines
,
the
bus
strikes
-
all_of
these
were
unheard-of
even
ten
years
ago
.
Today
's
evidence
,
such_as
the
fact
that
only
three
Southern
states
(
South_Carolina
,
Alabama
and
Mississippi
)
still
openly
defy
integration
,
would
have
astounded
many_of
yesterday
's
Southerners
into
speechlessness
.
Other
examples
of
gradual
changes
that
have
affected
the
Negro
have
been
his
moving
up
,
row
by
row
,
in
the
busses
;
his
requesting
,
and
often
getting
,
higher
wages
,
better
working
conditions
,
better
schools
-
changes
that
were
slowly
emerging
even
before
the
Supreme_Court
decision
of
1954
.
Then
came
this
decision
,
which
sped
the
process
of
gaining
equality
(
or
perhaps
hindered
it
;
only
historical
evolution
will
determine
which
)
:
an
abrupt_change
.
Since
1954
the
Negro
's
desire
for
social
justice
has
led
to
an
ironically
anarchical
rebellion
.
He
has
frequently
refused
to
move
from
white
lunch
counters
,
refused
to
obey
local
laws
which
he
considers
unjust
,
while
in
other
cases
he
has
appealed_to
federal
laws
.
This
bold
self-assertion
,
after
decades
of
humble
subservience
,
is
indeed
a
twentieth-century
phenomenon
,
an
abrupt_change
in
the
Southern
way
of
existence
.
A
new
order
is
thrusting
itself
into
being
.
A
new
South
is
emerging
after
the
post-bellum
years
of
hesitation
,
uncertainty
,
and
lack
of
action
from
the
Negro
in
defining
his
new
role
in
the
amorphously
defined
socio-political
organizations
of
the
white_man
.
The
modern
Negro
has
not
made
a
decisive
debut
into
Southern
fiction
.
It
is
clear
that
,
while
most
writers
enjoy
picturing
the
Negro
as
a
woolly-headed
,
humble
old
agrarian
who
mutters
``
yassuhs
''
and
``
sho
'
nufs
''
with
blissful
deference
to
his
white
employer
(
or
,
in
Old_South
terms
,
``
massuh
''
)
,
this
stereotype
is
doomed
to
become
in_reality
as
obsolete
as
Caldwell
's
Lester
.
While
there
may
still
be
many
Faulknerian
Lucas
Beauchamps
scattered
through
the
rural
South
,
such
men
appear
to
be
a
vanishing
breed
.
Writers
openly
admit
that
the
Negro
is
easier
to
write
than
the
white_man
;
but
they
obviously
mean
by
this
,
not
a
Negro
personality
,
but
a
Negro
type
.
Presenting
an
individualized
Negro
character
,
it
would
seem
,
is
one
of
the_most
difficult
assignments
a
Southern
writer
could
tackle
;
and
the
success
of
such
an
endeavor
is
,
as
suggested
above
,
glaringly
rare
.
Just_as
the
Negro
situation
points_up
the
gradual
and
abrupt_changes
affecting
Southern
life
,
it
also
points_up
the
non-representation
of
urbanism
in
Southern
literature
.
The
book
concerned
with
the
Negro
's
role
in
an
urban
society
is
rare
indeed
;
recently
only
Keith_Wheeler
's
novel
,
Peaceable_Lane
,
has
openly
faced
the
problem
.
All_but
the_most
rabid
of
Confederate_flag
wavers
admit
that
the
Old_Southern
tradition
is
defunct
in
actuality
and
sigh
that
its
passing
was_accompanied_by
the
disappearance
of
many
genteel
and
aristocratic
traditions
of
the
reputedly
languid
ante-bellum
way_of_life
.
Many
earlier
writers
,
mourning
the
demise
of
the
old
order
,
tended
to
romanticize
and
exaggerate
this
``
gracious
Old_South
''
imagery
,
creating
such
lasting
impressions
as
Margaret_Mitchell
's
``
Tara
''
plantation
.
Modern
writers
,
who
are
supposed
to
keep
their
fingers
firmly
upon
the
pulse
of
their
subjects
,
insist
upon
drawing_out
this
legend
,
prolonging
its
burial
,
when
it
well
deserves
a
rest
after
the
overexploitation
of
the
past
century
.
Perhaps
these
writers
have
been
too
deeply
moved
by
this
romanticizing
;
but
they
can
hardly
deny
that
,
exaggerated
or
not
,
the
old
panorama
is
dead
.
As
John_T._Westbrook
says
in
his
article
,
``
Twilight
of
Southern_Regionalism
''
(
Southwest_Review
,
Winter
1957
)
:
``
The
miasmal
mausoleum
where
an
Old_South
,
already
too
minutely
autopsied
in
prose
and
poetry
,
should
be_left
to
rest
in
peace
,
forever
dead
and
(
let
us
fervently
hope
)
forever
done_with
''
.
Westbrook
further
bemoans
the
Southern
writers
'
creation
of
an
unreal
image
of
their
homeland
,
which
is
too
readily
assimilated
by
both
foreign
readers
and
visiting
Yankees
:
``
Our
northerner
is
suspicious
of
all
this
crass
evidence
[
of
urbanization
]
presented
to
his
senses
.
It
bewilders
and
befuddles
him
.
He
is
too
deeply
steeped
in
William_Faulkner
and
Robert_Penn_Warren
.
The
fumes
of
progress
are
in
his
nose
and
the
bright
steel
of
industry
towers
before
his
eyes
,
but
his
heart
is
away
in
Yoknapatawpha_County
with
razorback_hogs
and
night_riders
.
On
this
trip
to_the_South
he
wants
,
above_all
else
,
to
sniff
the
effluvium
of
backwoods-and-sand-hill
subhumanity
and
to
see
at_least
one
barn
burn
at
midnight
''
.
Obviously
,
such
a
Northern
tourist
's
purpose
is
somewhat
akin
to
a
child
's
experience
with
Disneyland
:
he
wants
to
see
a
world
of
make-believe
.
In_the_meantime
,
while
the
South
has
been
undergoing
this
phenomenal
modernization
that
is
so
disappointing
to
the
curious
Yankee
,
Southern
writers
have
certainly
done
little
to
reflect
and
promote
their
region
's
progress
.
Willard_Thorp
,
in
his
new
book
American
Writing
in
the
Twentieth_Century
,
observes
,
quite
validly
it
seems
:
``
Certain
subjects
are
conspicuously
absent
or
have
been
only
lightly
touched
.
No
southern
novelist
has
done
for
Atlanta
or
Birmingham
what
Herrick
,
Dreiser
,
and
Farrell
did
for
Chicago
or
Dos_Passos
did
for
New_York
.
There
are
almost_no
fictional
treatments
of
the
industrialized
south
''
.
Not
a
single
Southern
author
,
major
or
minor
,
has
made
the
urban
problems
of
an
urban
South
his
primary
source
material
.
Faulkner
,
for
one
,
appears
to
be
safe
from
the
accusing
fingers
of
all
assailants
in_this
regard
.
Faulkner
culminates
the
Southern
legend
perhaps
more
masterfully
than
it
has
ever
been
,
or
could
ever
be
,
done
.
He
has
made
it
his
,
and
his
it
remains
,
irrevocably
.
He
treats
it
with
a
mythological
,
universal
application
.
As
his
disciples
boast
,
even_though
his
emphasis
is
elsewhere
,
Faulkner
does
show
his
awareness
of
the
changing
order
of
the
South
quite
keenly
,
as
can
be
proven
by
a
quick
recalling
of
his
Sartoris
and
Snopes
families
.
Even
two
decades
ago
in
Go_Down
,
Moses_Faulkner
was
looking_to
the
more
urban
future
with
a
glimmer
of
hope
that
through
its
youth
and
its
new
way_of_life
the
South
might
be
reborn
and
the
curse
of
slavery
erased
from
its
soil
.
Yet
his
concern
even
here
is
with
a
slowly
changing
socio-economic
order
in_general
,
and
he
never
deals
with
such
specific
aspects
of_this
change
as
the
urban
and
industrial
impact
.
Faulkner
traces
,
in
his
vast
and
overpowering
saga
of
Yoknapatawpha_County
,
the
gradual
changes
which
seep
into
the
South
,
building
layer
upon
layer
of
minute
,
subtle
innovation
which
eventually
tend
largely
to
hide
the
Old
Way
.
Thus
Faulkner
reminds
us
,
and
wisely
,
that
the
``
new
''
South
has
gradually
evolved
out
of
the
Old_South
,
and
consequently
its
agrarian
roots
persist
.
Yet
he
presents
a
realm
of
source
material
which
may
well
serve
other
writers
if_not
himself
:
the
problems
with
which
a
New_South
must
grapple
in
groping
through
a
blind
adolescence
into
the
maturity
of
urbanization
.
With
new
mechanization
the
modern
farmer
must
perform
the
work
of
six
men
:
a
machine
stands
between
the
agrarian
and
his
soil
.
The
thousands
of
city
migrants
who
desert
the
farms
yearly
must
readjust
with
even
greater
stress
and
tension
:
the
sacred
wilderness
is
gradually
surrendering
to
suburbs
and
research
parks
and
industrial
areas
.
