All
false
gods
resemble
Moloch
,
at_least
in
the
early
phases
of
their
careers
,
so
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
any
form
of
idol-worship
to
become
widespread
without
the
accompaniment
of
human
sacrifice
.
But
there
is
reason
in_all
things
,
and
in_this
country
the
heathenish
cult
of
the
motor-car
is
exceeding
all
bounds
in
its
demands
.
The
annual
butchery
of
40000
American
men
,
women
and
children
to
satiate
its
blood-lust
is
excessive
;
a
quota
of
25000
a
year
would
be
more_than
sufficient
.
No
other
popular
idol
is
accorded
even
that_much
grace
.
If
the
railroads
,
for_example
,
regularly
slaughtered
25000
passengers
each_year
,
the
high_priests
of
the
cult
would
have
cause
to
tremble
for
their
personal
safety
,
for
such
a
holocaust
would
excite
demands
for
the
hanging
of
every
railroad
president
in
the
United_States
.
But
by
comparison
with
the
railroad
,
the
motor
car
is
a
relatively
new
object
of
popular
worship
,
so
it
is
too_much
to
hope
that
it
may
be
brought
within
the
bounds
of
civilized
usage
quickly
and
easily
.
Yet
it
is
plainly
time
to
make
a
start
,
and
to
be
effective
the
first
move
should
be
highly
dramatic
,
without
being
fanatical
.
Here
,
then
,
is
what
Swift
would
have
called
a
modest
proposal
by
way
of
a
beginning
.
From
next
New_Year
's
Day
let
us
keep
careful
account
of
each
successive
fatality
on
the
highways
,
publicizing
it
on
all
media
of
communication
.
To
avoid
suspicion
of
bigotry
,
let
the
hand
of
vengeance
be
stayed
until
the
meat-wagon
has
picked_up
the
twenty-five
thousandth
corpse
;
but
let
the
twenty-five
thousand
and
first
butchery
be
the
signal
for
the
arrest
of
the
50
state_highway
commissioners
.
Then
let
the
whole
lot
be
hanged
in
a
public
mass
execution
on
July
4
,
1963
.
The
scene
,
of_course
,
should
be
nine
miles
northwest
of
Centralia
,
Illinois
,
the
geographical
center
of
population
according_to
the
census
.
A
special
grandstand
,
protected
by
awnings
from
the
midsummer
sun
of
Illinois
,
should
be
erected
for
occupancy
by
honored
guests
,
who
should
include
the
ambassadors
of
all
those
new
African_nations
as_yet
not_quite
convinced
that
the
United_States
is
thoroughly
civilized
.
The
band
should
play
the
Rogues
'
March
as
a
processional
,
switching
to
``
Hail_Columbia
,
Happy_Land
''
!
as
the
trap
is
sprung
.
Independence_Day
is
the
appropriate
date
as
a
symbolical
reminder
of
the
American
article
of
faith
that
governments
are
instituted
among
men
to
secure
to
them
certain
inalienable
rights
,
the
first
of_which
is
life
,
and
when
any
government
becomes
subversive
of_that
end
,
it
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter
or
abolish
it
.
The
highway_system
is
an
agency
of
government
,
and
when
it
grinds
up
40000
Americans
every_year
the
government
is
destroying
its
own
taxpayers
,
which
is
obviously
a
silly
thing
for
any
government
to
do
.
Hanging
the
responsible
officials
would
not
abolish
the
government
,
but
would
emphasize
its
accountability
for
the
lives
of
its
individual
citizens
,
which
would
certainly
alter
it
,
and
definitely
for
the
better
.
Moreover
,
the
salubrious
effects
would
not
be
exclusively
political
,
but
at_least
partially
,
and
perhaps
primarily
social
.
It
would
challenge
sharply
not
the
cult
of
the
motor
car
itself
but
some
of
its
ancillary
beliefs
and
practices
-
for_instance
,
the
doctrine
that
the
fulfillment
of
life
consists_in
proceeding
from
hither
to
yon
,
not
for
any
advantage
to
be
gained
by
arrival
but
merely
to
avoid
the
cardinal
sin
of
stasis
,
or
,
as_it_is
generally
termed
,
staying_put
.
True
,
the
adherents
of
staying_put
are
now
reduced
to
a
minor
,
even
a
miniscule
sect
,
and
their
credo
,
``
Home-keeping
hearts
are
happiest
''
,
is
as
disreputable
as
Socinianism
.
Nonetheless
,
although
few
in
number
they
are
a
stubborn
crew
,
as
tenacious
of
life
as
the
Hardshell
Baptists
,
which
suggests
that
there
is
some
kind_of
vital_principle
embodied
in
their
faith
.
Perhaps
there
is
more
truth
than
we
are
wont_to
admit
in
the
conviction
of_that
ornament
of
Tarheelia
,
Robert_Ruark
's
grandfather
,
who
was
persuaded
that
the
great
curse
of
the
modern_world
is
``
all
this
gallivantin
''
'
.
In_any_event
,
the
yearly
sacrifice
of
40000
victims
is
a
hecatomb
too
large
to
be
justified
by
the_most
ardent
faith
.
Somehow
our
contemporary
Moloch
must
be
induced
to
see
reason
.
Since
appeals
to
morality
,
to
humanity
,
and
to
sanity
have
had
such
small
effect
,
perhaps
our
last
recourse
is
the
deterrent_example
.
If
we
make
it
established
custom
that
whenever
butchery
on
the
highways
grows
excessive
,
say
beyond
25000
per_annum
,
then
somebody
is
going_to
hang
,
it
follows
that
the
more
eminent
the
victim
,
the
more
impressive
the
lesson
.
To
hang
50
Governors
might
be
preferable
except
that
they
are
not
directly
related_to
the
highways
;
so
,
all
things
considered
,
the
highway
commissioners
would
seem
to
be
elected
.
As
the
new
clouds
of
radioactive
fallout
spread
silently
and
invisibly
around
the
earth
,
the
Soviet_Union
stands
guilty
of
a
monstrous
crime
against
the
human_race
.
But
the
guilt
is
shared
by
the
United_States
,
Britain
and
France
,
the
other
members
of
the
atomic
club
.
Until
Moscow
resumed
nuclear
testing
last
September
1
,
the
US
and
UK
had
released
more_than
twice_as
much
radiation
into
the
atmosphere
as
the
Russians
,
and
the
fallout
from
the
earlier
blasts
is
still
coming_down
.
As
it
descends
,
the
concentration
of
radioactivity
builds_up
in
the
human_body
;
for
a
dose
of
radiation
is
not
like
a
flu
virus
which
causes
temporary
discomfort
and_then
dies
.
The
effect
of
radiation
is
cumulative
over
the
years
-
and
on
to
succeeding
generations
.
So
,
while
we
properly
inveigh
against
the
new
poisoning
,
history
is
not
likely
to
justify
the
pose
of
righteousness
which
some
in
the
West
were
so
quick
to
assume
when
Mr._Khrushchev
made
his
cynical
and
irresponsible
threat
.
Shock
,
dismay
and
foreboding
for
future
generations
were
legitimate
reactions
;
a
holier-than-thou
sermon
was
not
.
On
October
19
,
after
the
Soviets
had
detonated
at_least
20
nuclear
devices
,
Ambassador_Stevenson
warned
the
UN
General_Assembly
that
this
country
,
in
``
self
protection
''
,
might
have
to
resume
above-ground
tests
.
More
recently
,
the
chairman
of
the
Atomic_Energy
Commission
,
Dr._Glenn_T._Seaborg
,
``
admitted
''
to
a
news_conference
in
Las_Vegas
,
Nevada
,
that
the
US
might
fall_behind
Russia
(
he
apparently
meant
in
weapons
development
)
if
the
Soviets
continue
to
test
in
the
atmosphere
while
we
abstain
.
The
trial_balloons
are
afloat
.
All_of
which
makes
it
more
imperative
than
ever
that
the
biological
and
genetic
effects
of
fallout
be
understood
.
But
for
the
average
citizen
,
unfortunately
,
this
is
one
of
science
's
worst-marked
channels
,
full_of
tricky
currents
and
unknown
depths
.
The
scientists
,
in
and
out
of
government
,
do
not
agree
on
some
of
the_most
vital
points
,
at_least
publicly
.
On_the_one_hand
,
the
Public_Health_Service
declared
as
recently
as
October
26
that
present
radiation
levels
resulting
from
the
Soviet
shots
``
do
not
warrant
undue
public
concern
''
or
any
action
to
limit
the
intake
of
radioactive
substances
by
individuals
or
large
population
groups
anywhere
in
the
US
.
But
the
PHS
conceded
that
the
new
radioactive
particles
``
will
add
to
the
risk
of
genetic
effects
in
succeeding
generations
,
and
possibly
to
the
risk
of
health
damage
to
some
people
in
the
United_States
''
.
Then
it
added
:
``
It
is
not
possible
to
determine
how
extensive
these
ill
effects
will
be
-
nor
how
many
people
will
be
affected
''
.
Having
hedged
its
bets
in_this_way
,
PHS
apparently
decided
it
would
be
possible
to
make
some
sort_of
determination
after_all
:
``
At_present
radiation
levels
,
and
even
at
somewhat
higher
levels
,
the
additional
risk
is
slight
and
very_few
people
will
be
affected
''
.
Then
,
to
conclude
on
an
indeterminate
note
:
``
Nevertheless
,
if
fallout
increased
substantially
,
or
remained
high
for
a
long_time
,
it
would
become
far
more
important
as
a
potential
health
hazard
in_this
country
and
throughout_the_world
''
.
Dr._Linus_Pauling
,
a
Nobel_Prize
winner
in
chemistry
,
has
been
less
ambiguous
,
whether
you
choose
to
agree
with
him
or
not
.
After
declaring
,
in
an
article
last
month
in
Frontier
magazine
,
that
the
Russian
testing
``
carries
with_it
the
possibility
of
the_most
tragic
consequences
of
any
action
in
the
history
of
the
world
''
,
he
gave
this
estimate
of
the
biologic
and
genetic
consequences
if
the
new
Soviet
shots
totaled
200
megatons
:
The
damage
to
human
germ_plasm
would
be
such_that
in
the
next
few
generations
160000
children
around
the
world
would
be_born
with
gross
physical
or
mental
defects
.
Long-lived
carbon-14
from
the
fusion
process
would
cause
four
million
embryonic
,
neonatal
or
childhood
deaths
and
stillbirths
over
the
next
20
generations
,
and
between
200000
and
one
million
human_beings
now
living
would
have
their
lives
cut_short
by
radiation-produced
diseases
such_as
leukemia
.
Most_of
these
would
be
in
the
Northern_Hemisphere
,
where
the
fallout
is
concentrating
.
Pauling
's
estimate
of
200
megatons
yield
from
the
present
series
of
Russian
tests
will
probably
turn_out
to
be
too
high
,
but
a
total
of
100
megatons
is
a
distinct
possibility
.
The
lack
of
scientific
unanimity
on
the
effects
of
radiation
is_due
in_part
to
insufficient
data
covering
large
population
groups
,
from
which
agreed-on
generalizations
could
be
drawn
.
But
more_than
one
conscientious
researcher
has
been
inhibited
from
completely
frank
discussion
of
the
available
evidence
by
the
less
excusable
fact
that
fallout
has
been
made
a
political
issue
as_well
as
a
scientific
problem
.
Its
dangerous
effects
have
been
downgraded
to
the
public
by
some
who
believe
national
security
requires
further
testing
.
An
illustration
of_this
attitude
is
found
in
John_A._McCone
's
letter
to
Dr._Thomas_Lauritsen
,
reported
in
a
note
elsewhere
in_this
issue
of
The
New_Republic
.
To
this
day
the
Atomic_Energy
Commission
shies_away_from
discussing
the
health
aspects
of
fallout
.
A
recent
study
on
radiation
exposure
by
the
AEC
's
division
of
biology
and
medicine
stated
:
``
The
question
of
the
biological
effect
of
[
radiation
]
doses
is
not
considered
''
herein
.
Of_course
,
the
AEC
is
in
a
bind
now
.
If
it
comes_down
too
hard
on
the
potential
dangers
of
fallout
,
it
will
box
the
President
on
resuming
atmospheric
tests
.
So
the
Commission
's
announcements
of
the
new
Soviet
shots
have
been
confined
to
one
or
two
bleak
sentences
,
with
the
fission
yield
usually
left
vague
.
Now
,
of_course
,
that
the
Russians
are
the
nuclear
villains
,
radiation
is
a
nastier
word
than
it
was
in
the
mid-1950s
,
when
the
US
was
testing
in
the
atmosphere
.
The
prevailing
official
attitude
then
seemed
to
be
that
fallout
,
if_not
exactly
good_for_you
,
might
not
be
much
worse
than
a
bad
cold
.
After
a
nuclear
blast
,
one
bureaucrat
suggested
in
those
halcyon
days
,
about
all
you
had
to
do
was
haul
out
the
broom
and
sweep
off
your
sidewalks
and
roof
.
Things
are
n't
that
simple
anymore
.
Yet
if
Washington
gets
too
indignant
about
Soviet
fallout
,
it
will
have
to
do
a_lot_of
fast
footwork
if
America
decides
it
too
must
start
pushing_up
the
radiation
count
.
As
of
October
25
,
the
AEC
had
reported
24
shots
in
the
new
Soviet
series
,
12
of
them
in
a
megaton
range
,
including
a
super
bomb
with
a
yield
of
30
to
50
megatons
(
the
equivalent
of
30
million
to
50
million
tons
of
TNT
)
;
and
President_Kennedy
indicated
there
were
one
or
two
more_than
those
reported
.
Assuming
the
lower
figure
for
the
big
blast
and
one_shot
estimated
by
the
Japanese
at
10
megatons
,
a
conservative
computation
is
that
the
24
announced
tests
produced
a
total
yield
of
at_least
60
megatons
.
Some
government
scientists
say
privately
that
the
figure
probably
is
closer
to
80
megatons
,
and
that
the
full
50
-
megaton_bomb
that
Khrushchev
mentioned
may
still
be
detonated
.
If
the
new
Soviet
series
has
followed
the
general
pattern
of
previous
Russian
tests
,
the
shots
were
roughly
half
fission
and
half
fusion
,
meaning
a
fission
yield
of
30
to
40
megatons
thus_far
.
To
this
must
be
added
the
90
to
92
megatons
of
fission
yield
produced
between
the
dawn
of
the
atomic
age
in
1945
and
the
informal
three-power
test
moratorium
that
began
in
November
,
1958
.
