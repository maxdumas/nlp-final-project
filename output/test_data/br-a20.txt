Vital
secrets
of
Britain
's
first
atomic
submarine
,
the
Dreadnought
,
and
,
by
implication
,
of
the
entire
United_States
navy
's
still-building
nuclear
sub
fleet
,
were
stolen
by
a
London-based
soviet
spy
ring
,
secret_service
agents
testified
today
.
The
Dreadnought
was
built
on
designs
supplied
by
the
United_States
in
1959
and
was
launched
last
year
.
It
is
a
killer
sub
-
that_is
,
a
hunter
of
enemy
subs
.
It
has
a
hull
patterned
on_that
of
the
United_States
navy
's
Nautilus
,
the
world
's
first
atomic
submarine
.
Its
power_unit
,
however
,
was
derived
from
the
reactor
of
the
more
modern
American
nuclear
submarine
Skipjack
.
The
announcement
that
the
secrets
of
the
Dreadnought
had
been
stolen
was
made
in
Bow_st.
police_court
here
at
the
end
of
a
three
day
hearing
.
A
full
trial
was
ordered
for
:
Two
British
civil_servants
,
Miss_Ethel
Gee
,
46
,
and
her
newly
devoted
friend
,
Harry_Houghton
,
55
,
and
divorced
.
They
are
accused
of
whisking
secrets
out
of
naval
strongrooms
over
which
they
kept_guard
.
Gordon_A._Lonsdale
,
37
,
a
mystery
man
presumed
to
be
Russian
altho
he
carries
a
Canadian
passport
.
When
arrested
,
he
had
the
submarine
secrets
on
a
roll
of
candid_camera
film
as_well
as
anti-submarine
secrets
in
Christmas_gift
wrapping
,
it
was
testified
.
A
shadowy
couple
who
call
themselves
Peter_Kroger
,
bookseller
,
and
wife
,
Joyce
.
[
In
Washington
,
the
Federal_Bureau
of
Investigation
identified
the
Krogers
as
Morris
and
Lola_Cohen
,
an
American
couple
formerly
of
New_York_City
.
]
In
their
suburban
cottage
the
crown
charges
,
the
Krogers
received
secrets
from
the
mystery
man
,
usually
on
the
first
Saturday
evening
of
each_month
,
and
spent
much
of
the
week-end
getting
the
secrets
off
to
Moscow
,
either
on
a
powerful
transmitter
buried
under
the
kitchen
floor
or
as
dots
posted
over
period
marks
in
used
books
.
Each
dot
on
magnification
resumed
its
original
condition
as
a
drawing
,
a
printed
page
,
or
a
manuscript
.
All
five
pleaded
innocent
.
Only
Miss
Gee
asked
for
bail
.
Her
young
British
lawyer
,
James_Dunlop
,
pleaded
that
she
was
sorely
needed
at
her
Portland
home
by
her
widowed
mother
,
80
,
her
maiden_aunt
,
also
80
and
bedridden
for
20
years
,
and
her
uncle
,
76
,
who
once
ran
a
candy
shop
.
``
I
am
not
prepared
to
grant
bail
to
any
of
them
''
,
said
the
magistrate
,
K._J._P._Baraclough
.
The
trial
will
be
held
,
probably
the
first
week
of
March
,
in
the
famous
Old_Bailey
central
criminal_court
where
Klaus_Fuchs
,
the
naturalized
British
German
born
scientist
who
succeeded
in
giving
American
and
British
atomic_bomb
secrets
to
Russia
and
thereby
changed
world
history
during
the
1950
s
,
was
sentenced
to
14
years
in
prison
.
Fourteen
years
is
the
maximum
penalty
now
faced
by
the
new
five
,
who
may
have
altered
history
in
the
1960
s
.
Fuchs
,
after
nine
and
a
half
years
,
was
released
,
being
given
time_off
for_good
behavior
.
He
promptly
went_to
communist
East_Germany
.
The
magistrate
tonight
refused
to
return
to
the
five
$
29000
in
American
and
British
currency
,
mostly
$
20
bills
,
and
in
British
government
bonds
and
stocks
.
``
This
is
Russian
money
''
,
said
Mervin_Griffith-Jones
for
the
attorney_general
's
office
.
He
asserted
that
the
Krogers
were
the
bankers
for
Moscow
,
Lonsdale
the
Red
paymaster
,
and
the
two
civil_servants
the
recipients
for
selling
their
country
's
secrets
.
The
fact
that
secrets
of
the
Dreadnought
,
and
thereby
of
the
American
undersea
fleet
,
were
involved
in
the
spy
case
had
been
hinted
at
earlier
.
But
just
before
luncheon
today
the
fact
was
announced
grimly
by
the_British
navy
's
chief
adviser
to
the
cabinet
on
underwater
warfare
,
Capt._George_Symonds
.
He
said
that
drawings
of
the
Dreadnought
and
printed
details
about
the
ship
were
found
reproduced
in
an
undeveloped
roll
of
film
taken
from
Lonsdale
when
he
was
arrested
with
the
two
civil_servants
outside
the
Old_Vic
theater
Saturday
afternoon
,
Jan.
7
.
The
information
,
he
said
,
would
have
been
of
the
highest
value
to
a
potential
enemy
.
Just
how
many
sub
secrets
were
being
handed_over
when
the
ring
,
watched
for
six
months
,
was
broken
remained
untold
.
The_British
defending
lawyers
,
who
today
increased
from
three
to
four
,
demanded
to
know
if
they
could
make
the
information
involved
seem
of
little
value
to
a
jury
,
the
chances
of
their
clients
would
improve
.
So
in
the
name
of
justice
the
magistrate
cleared
the
court
of
all
except
officials
to
allow
the
captain
to
elaborate
for
almost
an
hour
.
Almost
any
information
about
the
Dreadnought
would
also
reveal
secrets
about
the
American
underwater
fleet
.
Britain
began
designing
the
ship
in
1956
but
got
nowhere
until
the
American
government
decided
to
end
a
ban
on
sharing
military
secrets
with
Britain
that
had
been
imposed
after
Fuchs
blabbed
.
The
United_States
offered
to
supply
a
complete
set
of
propelling
equipment
like
that
used
in
the
Skipjack
.
With
the
machinery
went
a
complete
design
for
the
hull
.
The
Skipjack
was
a
second
generation
atomic
sub
,
much
advanced
on
the
Nautilus
and
the
other
four
which
preceded
it
.
``
Much
of
the
navy
's
future
depends_upon
her
''
,
an
American
naval
announcement
said
on
the
Skipjack
's
first
arrival
in
British
waters
in
August
,
1959
,
for
exhibition
to
selected
high
officers
at
Portland
underwater
research
station
.
It
was
there
that
the
two
accused
civil_servants
were
at_work
.
``
Her
basic
hull
form
[
a
teardrop
]
and
her
nuclear_power
plant
will
be
used
for
almost
all
new
submarines
,
including
the
potent
Polaris
missile
submarines
''
,
the
statement
went_on
.
The
atom
reactor
,
water
cooled
,
was
the
result
of
almost
a
decade
of
research
at
the
naval
reactors
branch
of
the
atomic_energy
commission
and
Westinghouse_Electric_Corp.
.
Thru
development
,
the
reactor
and
its
steam_turbines
had
been
reduced
greatly
in
size
,
and
also
in
complexity
,
allowing
a
single
propeller
to
be
used
,
the
navy
said
.
The
hull
was
also
a
result
of
almost
a
decade
of
work
.
It
was
first
tried_out
on
a
conventional
submarine
,
the
Albacore
,
in
1954
.
The
Skipjack
became
the
fastest
submarine
ever
built
.
Reputedly
it
could
outrun
,
underwater
,
the
fastest
destroyers
.
It
could
,
reputedly
,
go
70000
miles
without
refueling
and
stay
down
more_than
a
month
.
It
was
of
the
hunter-killer
type
,
designed
to
seek_out
ships
and
other
submarines
with
its
most
advance
gear
and
destroy
them
with
torpedoes
.
The
navy
captain
disclosed
also
that
a
list
of
questions
found
in
Miss
Gee
's
purse
would
,
if
completed
and
handed
back
,
have
given
the
Kremlin
a
complete
picture
``
of
our
current
anti-submarine
effort
and
would
have
shown
what
we
are
doing
in
research
and
development
for
the
future
''
.
The
spy
ring
also
was
particularly
interested
in
ASDIC
,
the
underwater
equipment
for
detecting
submarines
,
it
was
testified
.
Range
was
a
vital
detail
.
Designs
of
parts
were
sought
.
Six
radiomen
told
how
,
twice
on
two
days
after
the
ring
was
nabbed
,
a
transmitter
near
Moscow
was
heard
calling
,
using
signals
,
times
and
wavelengths
specified
on
codes
found
hidden
in
cigaret
lighters
in
Lonsdale
's
apartment
and
the
Krogers
'
house
and
also
fastened
to
the
transmitter
lid
.
Oddly
,
the
calls
were
still
heard
11
days
after
the
five
were
arrested
.
The
charge
that
the
federal
indictment
of
three
Chicago
narcotics
detail
detectives
``
is
the
product
of
rumor
,
combined
with
malice
,
and
individual
enmity
''
on
the
part
of
the
federal
narcotics
unit
here
was
made
yesterday
in
their
conspiracy
trial
before
Judge_Joseph_Sam_Perry
in
federal_District
court
.
The
three
-
Miles_J._Cooperman
,
Sheldon_Teller
,
and
Richard_Austin
-
and
eight
other
defendants
are
charged
in
six
indictments
with
conspiracy
to
violate
federal
narcotic
laws
.
In
his
opening
statement
to
a
jury
of
eight
women
and
four
men
,
Bernard_H._Sokol
,
attorney
for
the
detectives
,
said
that
evidence
would
show
that
his
clients
were
``
entirely
innocent
''
.
``
When
they
became
members
of
the
city
police
narcotics
unit
''
,
Sokol
said
,
``
they
were
told
they
would
have
to
get
to
know
certain
areas
of
Chicago
in_which
narcotics
were
sold
and
they
would
have
to
get
to
know
people
in
the
narcotics
racket
.
They
,
on_occasion
,
posed
as
addicts
and
peddlers
''
.
Altho
federal
and
city
narcotic
agents
sometimes
worked
together
,
Sokol
continued
,
rivalries
developed
when
they
were
``
aiming
at
the
same
criminals
''
.
This
,
he
added
,
brought_about
``
petty
jealousies
''
and
``
petty
personal
grievances
''
.
``
In
the
same
five
year
period
that
the
United_States
says
they
[
the
detectives
]
were
engaged
in
this
conspiracy
''
,
Sokol
continued
,
``
these
three
young_men
received
a
total
of
26
creditable
mentions
and
many
special
compensations
,
and
were
nominated
for
the
Lambert_Tree
award
and
the
mayor
's
medal
''
.
In
opening
,
D._Arthur_Connelly
,
assistant
United_States
attorney
,
read
the
indictment
,
but
made
no
comments
.
Attorneys
for
the
eight
other
defendants
said
only
that
there
was
no
proof
of
their
clients
'
guilt
.
Cooperman
and
Teller
are
accused
of
selling
$
4700
worth
of
heroin
to
a
convicted
narcotics
peddler
,

av.
.
Among
other
acts
,
Teller
and

and
former
bail
bondsman
,

statements
had
been
made
.
But
court
adjourned
after
he
testified
he
introduced
James_White
and
Jeremiah_Hope_Pullings
,
two
of
the
defendants
,
and
also
introduced
Pullings
to
Jessy_Maroy
,
a
man
mentioned
in
the
indictment
but
not
indicted
.
Buaford_Robinson
,
23
,
of
7026
Stewart
av.
,
a
CTA
bus_driver
,
was
slugged
and
robbed
last
night
by
a
group
of
youths
at
51
st
street
and
South_Park
way
.
Robinson
was
treated
at
a
physician
's
office
for
a
cut
over
his
left
eyebrow
and
a
possible
sprained
knee
.
His
losses
included
his
money
bag
,
containing
$
40
to
$
50
and
his
$
214
paycheck
.
Robinson
told
Policemen
James_Jones
and
Morgan_Lloyd
of
the
Wabash
avenue
district
that
10
youths
boarded
his
south
bound
express_bus
in_front
of
Dunbar_Vocational
High_school
,
30
th
street
and
South_Park

,
and
began
``
skylarking
''
.
When
51
st
street
was
reached
,
Robinson
related
,
he
stopped
the
bus
and
told
the
youths
he
was
going
to
call
the
CTA
supervisor
.
As
he
left
the
bus
with
his
money
bag
,
Robinson
added
,
the
largest
youth
accosted
him
,
a
quarrel
ensued
,
and
the
youth
knocked
him
down
.
Then
the
youths
fled
with
his
money
.
Mrs._Blanche_Dunkel
,
60
,
who
has
spent
25
years
in
the
Dwight
reformatory
for
women
for
the
murder
in
1935
of
her
son-in-law
,
Ervin_Lang
,
then

,
appealed
for
a
parole
at
a
hearing
yesterday
before
two
Illinois
pardon

parole
board_members
,
John_M._Bookwalter
and
Joseph_Carpentier
.
She
had
been
sentenced
to
180
years
in
prison
,
but
former

commuted
her
term
to
75
years
,
making
her
eligible
for
parole
,
as
one
of
his
last
acts
in
office
.
Mrs._Dunkel
admitted
the
slaying
and
said
that
the
son-in-law
became
her
lover
after
the
death
of
her
daughter
in
1934
.
It
was
when
he
attempted
to
end
the
relationship
that
the
murder
took_place
