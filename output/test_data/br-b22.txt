One
of
the
inescapable
realities
of
the
Cold_War
is
that_is
has
thrust
upon
the
West
a
wholly
new
and
historically
unique
set
of
moral
dilemmas
.
The
first
dilemma
was
the
morality
of
nuclear
warfare
itself
.
That
dilemma
is
as
much
with
us
as
ever
.
The
second
great
dilemma
has
been
the
morality
of
nuclear
testing
,
a
dilemma
which
has
suddenly
become
acute
because
of
the
present
series
of
Soviet
tests
.
When
this
second
dilemma
first
became
obvious
-
during
the
mid
to
late
'
50
's
-
the
United_States
appeared
to
have
three
choices
.
It
could
have
unilaterally
abandoned
further
testing
on
the
grounds
of
the
radiation
hazard
to
future
generations
.
It
could
have
continued
testing
to_the_full
on
the
grounds
that
the
radiation
danger
was
far
less_than
the
danger
of
Communist
world
domination
.
Or
it
could
have
chosen
to
find
-
by
negotiation
-
some
way
of
stopping
the
tests
without
loss
to
national
security
.
This
third
choice
was
in_fact
made
.
With
the
resumption
of
Soviet
testing
and
their
intransigence
at
the
Geneva
talks
,
however
,
the
hope
that
this
third
choice
would
prove
viable
has
been
shaken
.
Once_again
,
the
United_States
must
choose
.
And
once_again
,
the
choices
are
much
the
same
.
Only
this
time
around
the
conditions
are
different
and
the
choice
is
far
harder
.
The
first
choice
,
abandoning
tests
entirely
,
would
not_only
be
unpopular
domestically
,
but
would
surely
be
exploited
by
the
Russians
.
The
second
choice
,
full
testing
,
has
become
even
more
risky
just
because
the
current
Soviet
tests
have
already
dangerously
contaminated
the
atmosphere
.
The
third
choice
,
negotiation
,
presupposes
,
as
Russian
behavior
demonstrates
,
a
great_deal
of
wishful_thinking
to
make
it
appear
reasonable
.
We
take
the
position
,
however
,
that
the
third
choice
still
remains
the
only
sane
one
open_to
us
.
It
is
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
a
happy
choice
and
the
arguments
against
it
as
a
practical
strategy
are
formidable
.
Its
primary
advantage
is
that
it
is
a
moral
choice
;
one
which
,
should
it
fail
,
will
not
have
contaminated
the
conscience
.
That
is
the
contamination
we
most
fear
.
LEAVING
ASIDE
the
choice
of
unilateral
cessation
of
tests
as
neither
sane
nor
clearly
moral
,
the
question
must
arise
as
to
why
resumption
of
atmospheric
tests
on
our
part
would
not
be
a
good
choice
.
For
that
is
the
one
an
increasingly
large_number
of
prominent
Americans
are
now
proposing
.
In_particular
,
Governor_Nelson_Rockefeller
has
expressed
as
cogently
and
clearly
as
anyone
the
case
for
a
resumption
of
atmospheric
tests
.
Speaking
recently
in
Miami
,
Governor_Rockefeller
said
that
``
to
assure
the
sufficiency
of
our
own
weapons
in
the
face
of
the
recent
Soviet
tests
,
we
are
now
clearly
compelled
to
conduct
our
own
nuclear
tests
''
.
Taking_account
of
the
fact
that
such
a
move
on
our
part
would
be
unpopular
in
world
opinion
,
he
argued
that
the
responsibility
of
the
United_States
is
``
to
do
,
confidently
and
firmly
,
not
what
is
popular
,
but
what
is
right
''
.
What
was
missing
in
the
Governor
's
argument
,
as
in
so
many
similar
arguments
,
was
a
premise
which
would
enable
one
to
make
the
ethical
leap
from
what
might
be
militarily
desirable
to
what
is
right
.
The
possibility
,
as
he
asserted
,
that
the
Russians
may
get_ahead
of
us
or
come
closer
to
us
because
of
their
tests
does
not
supply
the
needed
ethical
premise
-
unless
,
of_course
,
we
have
unwittingly
become
so
brutalized
that
nuclear
superiority
is
now
taken
as
a
moral
demand
.
Besides
the
lack
of
an
adequate
ethical
dimension
to
the
Governor
's
case
,
one
can
ask
seriously
whether
our
lead
over
the
Russians
in
quality
and
quantity
of
nuclear_weapons
is
so
slight
as
to
make
the
tests
absolutely
necessary
.
Recent
statements
by
the
President
and
Defense_Department
spokesmen
have
,
to_the_contrary
,
assured
us
that
our
lead
is
very
great
.
Unless
the
Administration
and
the
Defense_Department
have
been
deceiving
us
,
the
facts
do
not
support
the
assertion
that
we
are
``
compelled
''
to
resume
atmospheric
testing
.
It
is
perfectly
conceivable
that
a
resumption
of
atmospheric
tests
may
,
at
some
point
in_the_future
,
be
necessary
and
even
justifiable
.
But
a
resumption
does
not
seem
justifiable
now
.
What
we
need
to
realize
is
that
the
increasingly
great
contamination
of
the
atmosphere
by
the
Soviet
tests
has
radically
increased
our
own
moral_obligations
.
We
now
have
to
think
not_only
of
our
national
security
but
also
of
the
future
generations
who
will
suffer
from
any
tests
we
might
undertake
.
This
is
an
ethical
demand
which
cannot
be
evaded
or
glossed_over
by
talking
exclusively
of
weapon
superiority
or
even
of
the
evil
of
Communism
.
Too
often
in_the_past
Russian
tactics
have
been
used
to
justify
like
tactics
on
our
part
.
There
ought_to
be
a
point
beyond
which
we
will
not
allow
ourselves
to
go
regardless_of
what
Russia
does
.
The
refusal
to
resume
atmospheric
testing
would
be
a
good
start
.
When
his
Holiness
Pope_John
23
,
first
called_for
an
Ecumenical_Council
,
and
at_the_same_time
voiced
his
yearning
for
Christian
unity
,
the
enthusiasm
among
Catholic
and
Protestant
ecumenicists
was
immediate
.
With
good
reason
it
appeared
that
a
new
day
was
upon
divided
Christendom
.
But
as
the
more
concrete
plans
for
the
work
of
the
Council
gradually
became
known
,
there
was
a
rather
sharp
and
abrupt
disappointment
on_all_sides
.
The
Council
we
now
know
will
concern
itself
directly
only
with
the
internal
affairs
of
the
Church
.
As
it
has
turned_out
,
however
,
the
excessive
enthusiasm
in
the
first
instance
and
the
loss
of
hope
in
the
second
were
both
wrong
responses
.
Two
things
have
happened
in
recent
months
to
bring
the
Council
into
perspective
:
each
provides
a
basis
for
renewed
hope
and
joy
.
First_of_all
,
it
is
now
known
that
Pope_John
sees
the
renewal
and
purification
of
the
Church
as
an
absolutely
necessary
step
toward
Christian
unity
.
Far
from
being
irrelevant
to
the
ecumenical
task
,
the
Pontiff
believes
that
a
revivified
Church
is
required
in_order
that
the
whole
world
may
see
Catholicism
in
the
best
possible
light
.
Equally
significant
,
Pope_John
has
said
that
Catholics
themselves
bear
some
responsibility
for
Christian
disunity
.
A
major
aim
of
the
Council
will
be
to
remove
as_far_as_possible
whatever
in
the
Church
today
stands
in
the
way
of
unity
.
Secondly
,
a
whole
series
of
addresses
and
actions
by
the
Pope
and
by
others
show
that
concern
for
Christian
unity
is
still
very_much
alive
and
growing
within
the
Church
.
The
establishment
,
by
the
Holy_Father
,
of
a
permanent
Secretariat
for
Christian_Unity
in
1960
was
the_most
dramatic
mark
of_this
concern
.
The
designation
of
five
Catholic
theologians
to
attend
the
World_Council
of
Churches
assembly
in
New_Delhi
as
``
official
''
observers
reverses
the
Church
's
earlier
stand
.
The
public
appeal
by
the
new
Vatican
Secretary_of_State
,
Cardinal_Cicognani
,
for
renewed
efforts
toward
Eastern
and
Western
reunion
was
still
another
remarkable
act
.
Nor
can
one
forget
Pope_John
's
unprecedented
meeting
with
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
.
Augustin_Cardinal_Bea
,
the
director
of
the
Secretariate
for
Christian_Unity
,
has
expressed
as
directly
as
anyone
the
new
spirit
that
pervades
the
Church
's
stance
toward
the
Protestant
and
Orthodox_Churches
.
Noting
all
the
difficulties
that
stand
in
the
way
of
reunion
,
he
has
said
that
they
ought
not
to
discourage
anyone
.
For
discouragement
,
or
the
temptation
to
abandon
our
efforts
,
``
would
show
that
one
placed
excessive
trust
in
purely
human
means
without
thinking
of
the
omnipotence
of
God
,
the
irresistible
efficacy
of
prayer
,
the
action
of
Christ
or
the
power
of
the
Divine_Spirit
''
.
Can
any
Christian
fail
to
respond
to
these
words
?
The
administration
's
official
budget
review
,
which
estimates
a
6.9
billion
dollar
deficit
for
the
current
fiscal_year
,
is
n't
making
anyone
happy
.
Certainly
it
is
n't
making
the
President
happy
,
and
he
has
been
doing
his
apologetic
best
to
explain
how
the
budget
got
into
its
unbalanced
condition
,
how
he
intends
to
economize
wherever
he
can
and_how
he
hopes
to
do
better
next
year
.
We
sympathize
with
Mr._Kennedy
,
but
we
feel
bound
to
say
that
his
budget
review
does
n't
please
us
either
,
although
for
very
different
reasons
.
Furthermore
,
we
find
his
defense
of
the
unbalanced
budget
more
dismaying
than
reassuring
.
In_the_first_place
,
a
large
part
of
the
discrepancy
between
President_Eisenhower
's
estimate
of
a
1.5
billion
dollar
surplus
for
the
same
period
and
the
new
estimate
of
an
almost
seven
billion
dollar
deficit
is
the
result
of
the
outgoing
President
's
farewell
gift
of
a
political
booby-trap
to
his
successor
.
The
Eisenhower
budget
was
simultaneously
inadequate
in
its
provisions
and
yet
extravagant
in
its
projections
of
revenue
to
be
received
.
The
rest
of
the
deficit
is
also
easily
understood
.
Four
billion
dollars
of
the
spending
increase
is
for
defense
,
an
expenditure
necessitated
by
the
penny-wise
policies
of
the
Eisenhhower_Administration
,
quite
apart
from
the
recent
crises
in
Berlin
and
elsewhere
.
Four_hundred
million
dollars
of
the
increase
is
for
the
expanded
space
program
,
a
responsibility
similarly
neglected
by
Mr._Eisenhower
.
The
farm
program
will
cost
an
additional
1.5
billion
,
because
of
unusual
weather
factors
,
the
Food
for
Peace
program
and
other
new
measures
.
Anti-recession
programs
-
aid
for
the
unemployed
,
their
children
and
for
depressed
areas
-
account_for
only
900
million
of
the
6.9
billion
dollar
deficit
.
Our
complaint
is
that
in
many
crucial
areas
the
Kennedy
programs
are
not
too
large
but
too
small
,
most
seriously
in
regard_to
the
conventional
arms
build-up
and
in
aid
and
welfare
measures
.
And
yet
Mr._Kennedy
persists
in
trying
to
mollify
the
intransigents
of
the
right
with
apologies
and
promises
of
``
tightening_up
''
and
``
economizing
''
.
We
wish
the
President
would
remember
that
``
fiscal
responsibility
''
was
the
battle-cry
of
the
party
that
lost
the
election
.
The
party
that
won
used_to
say
something
about
a
New_Frontier
.
Introduction
of
the
``
dialogue
''
principle
proved
strikingly
effective
at
the
thirty-fourth
annual
meeting
of
the
Catholic_Association
for
International_Peace
in
Washington
the
last
weekend
in
October
.
Two
of
the
principal
addresses
were
delivered
by
prominent
Protestants
,
and
when
the
speaker
was
a
Catholic
,
one
``
discussant
''
on
the
dais
tended_to
be
of
another
religious
persuasion
.
Several
effects
were
immediately
evident
.
Sessions
devoted_to
``
Ethics
and
Foreign_Policy
Trends
''
,
``
Moral_Principle
and
Political
Judgment
''
,
``
Christian_Ethics
in
the
Cold_War
''
and
related
subjects
proved
to
be
much
livelier
under
this
procedure
than
if
Catholics
were
merely
talking
to
themselves
.
Usually
questions
from
the
floor
were
directed
to
the
non-Catholic
speaker
or
discussion
leader
.
In
the
earlier
sessions
there
was
plentiful
discussion
on
the
natural_law
,
which
Dr._William_V._O
'
Brien
of
Georgetown_University
,
advanced
as
the
basis
for
widely
acceptable
ethical
judgments
on
foreign_policy
.
That
Aristotelean-Thomistic
principle
experienced
a
thorough
going-over
from
a_number_of
the
participants
,
but
in_the_end
the
concept
came
to
reassert
itself
.
Speakers
declared
that
Protestants
often
make
use
of
it
,
if
,
perhaps
,
by
some
other
name
.
A
Lebanese
Moslem
told
about
its
existence
and
application
in
the
Islamic
tradition
as
the
``
divine
law
''
,
while
a
C._A._I._P.
member
who
has
been
working
in
close
association
with
delegates
of
the
new
U._N.
nations
told
of
its
widespread
recognition
on
the
African
continent
.
The
impression
was
unmistakable
that
,
whatever
one
may
choose
to
call
it
,
natural_law
is
a
functioning
generality
with
a
certain
objective
existence
.
Another
question
that
arose
was
the
nature
of
the
dialogue
itself
.
The
stimulus
from
the
confrontation
of
philosophical
systems
involving
certain
differences
was
undeniable
.
It
was
expected
that
the
comparison
of
different
approaches
to
ethics
would
produce
a
better
grasp
of
each
other
's
positions
and
better
comprehension
of
one
's
own
.
But
a
realization
that
each
group
has
much
of
substance
to
learn
from
the
other
also
developed
,
and
a
strong
conviction
grew
that
each
had
insights
and
dimensions
to
contribute
to
ethically
acceptable
solutions
of
urgent
political
issues
.
One
effect
of
the
spirited
give-and-take
of
these
discussions
was
to
focus
attention
on
practical_applications
and
the
necessity
of
being
armed
with
the
facts
:
knowledge
of
the
destructive
force
of
even
the
tiniest
``
tactical
''
atomic
weapon
would
have
a
bearing
on
judgments
as
to
the
advisability
of
its
use
-
to
defend
Berlin
,
for_example
;
the
pervasive
influence
of
ideology
on
our
political
judgments
needs
to
be
recognized
and
taken
into
due
account
;
it
is
necessary
to
perceive
the
extent
of
foreign
aid
demanded
by
the
Christian
imperative
.
