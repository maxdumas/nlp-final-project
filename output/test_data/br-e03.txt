Five
,

,

,

,
one
,
fire
!
The
tremendous
energy
released
by
giant
rocket_engines
perhaps
can
be
felt
much
better
than
it
can
be
heard
.
The
pulsating
vibration
of
energy
clutches
at
the_pit
of
your
stomach
.
Never
before
has
the
introduction
of
a
weapon
caused
so_much
apprehension
and
fear
.
Nuclear_weapons
are
fearsome
,
but
the
long-range
ballistic_missile
gives
them
a
stealth
and
merciless
swiftness
which
is
much
more
terrifying
.
A
great
many
writers
are
bewitched
by
the
apparently
overwhelming
advantage
an
attacker
would
have
if
he
were
to
strike
with
complete
surprise
using
nuclear
rockets
.
It
is
relatively
easy
to
go
a
step
further
and
reason
that
an
attacker
,
in
possession
of
such
absolute
power
,
would
simultaneously
destroy
his
opponent
's
cities
and
people
.
With
a
nation
defenseless
before
it
,
why
would
the
attacker
spare
the
victim
's
people
?
Would
n't
the
wanton
destruction
of
cities
and
people
be
the
logical
act
of
complete
subjugation
?
The
nation
would
be
utterly
devastated
.
The
will
of
its
people
,
so
crucial
in_time
of
peril
,
would
be
broken
.
Nuclear_weapons
have
given
the
world
the
means
for
self-destruction
in
hours
or
days
;
and
now
rockets
have
given
it
the
means
to
destroy
itself
in
minutes
.
At
this
point
it
should
be
painfully
obvious
that
cities
,
being
``
soft
''
,
and
the
people
within
them
are
ideally
suited
to
destruction
by
nuclear_weapons
.
However
,
because
this
vulnerability
is
mutual
,
it
is
to
the
advantage
of
neither
side
to
destroy
the
opponent
's
cities
,
at_least
so_long
as
the
opponent
has
nuclear_weapons
with
which
to
effect
reprisal
.
It
should
be
appallingly
apparent
that
city-trading
is
not
a
profitable
military
tactic
.
ICBMs
have
given
us
a
capability
which
could
be
used
in
two
different
ways
.
They
could
be
used
to
attack
a
nation
's
people
(
which
would
inevitably
mean
the
loss
of
the
attacker
's
own
people
)
,
or
they
could
be
used
with
discrimination
to
destroy
the
enemy
's
military_force
.
If
our
national
interest
lies_in
being
able_to
fight
and
win
a
war
rather_than
committing
national
suicide
,
then
we
must
take
a
much
more
penetrating
look
at
ballistic_missiles
.
We
must
determine
whether
missiles
can
win
a
war
all
by
themselves
.
We
must
make
certain
that
the
aircraft
is
finished
before
we
give
the
entire
job
to
the
missile
.
Missiles
are
very
valuable
weapons
,
but
they
also
have
their
too
little
known
limitations
.
Because
of
a
missile
's
ballistic_trajectory
,
the
location
of
a
fixed
target
must
be
known
quite
accurately
.
Placing
missiles
in
submarines
,
on
barges
,
railroads
,
highways
,
surface
vessels
and
in_the_air
provides
them
with
passive
protection
by
taking_advantage
of
the
gravest
weakness
of
long-range
ballistic_missiles
today
-
the
extreme
difficulty
of
destroying
a
mobile
or
moving
target
with
such
weapons
.
One
must
first
detect
a
fleeting
mobile
or
moving
target
,
decide
that
it
is
worthy
of
destruction
,
select
the
missile
to
be
fired
against
the
target
,
compute
ballistics
for
the
flight
,
and
prepare
the
missile
for
firing
.
Even
if
all
these
operations
could
be_performed
instantaneously
,
the
ICBM
still
has
a
time
of
flight
to
the
target
of
about
30_minutes
.
Therefore
,
if
the
target
can
significantly
change
its
location
in
something
less_than
30_minutes
,
the
probability
of
having
destroyed
it
is
drastically
lowered
.
Because
of_this
,
it
would
appear
inevitable
that
an
increasing
percentage
of
strategic
missiles
will
seek
self-protection
in
mobility
-
at_least
until
missile
defenses
are
perfected
which
have
an
exceedingly
high
kill
probability
.
In_order_to
destroy
the
enemy
's
mobile
,
moving
,
or
imprecisely
located
strategic
forces
,
we
must
have
a
hunter-killer
capability
in_addition
to
our
missiles
.
Until
this
hunter-killer
operation
can
be_performed
by
spacecraft
,
manned
aircraft
appear
to
be
the
only
means
available
to
us
.
It
seems
reasonable
that
if
general
nuclear
war
is
not
to
be
one
cataclysmic
act
of
burning
each
other
's
citizens
to
cinders
,
we
must
have
a
manned
strategic
force
of
long-endurance
aircraft
capable_of
going_into
China
or
Russia
to
find
and
destroy
their
strategic
forces
which
continued
to
threaten
us
.
Let
us
suppose
the
Russians
decide
to
build
a
rail-mobile
ICBM
force
.
It
is
entirely
feasible
to
employ
aircraft
such_as
the
B-52
or
B-70
in
hunter-killer
operations
against
Soviet
railway-based
missiles
.
If
we
stop
thinking
in_terms_of
tremendous
multimegaton
nuclear_weapons
and
consider
employing
much
smaller
nuclear_weapons
which
may
be
more
appropriate
for
most
important
military
targets
,
it
would
seem
that
the
B-52
or
B-70
could
carry
a
great
many
small
nuclear_weapons
.
An
aircraft
with
a
load
of
small
nuclear_weapons
could
very
conceivably
be
given
a
mission
to
suppress
all
trains
operating
within
a
specified
geographic_area
of
Russia
-
provided
that
we
had
used
some
of
our
ICBMs
to
degrade
Russia
's
air_defenses
before
our
bombers
got
there
.
The
aircraft
could
be
used
to
destroy
other
mobile
,
fleeting
,
and
imprecisely
located
targets
as_well
as
the
known
,
fixed
and
hardened
targets
which
can
also
be
destroyed
by
missile
.
Why
,
then
,
are
n't
we
planning
a
larger
,
more
important
role
for
manned
military
aircraft
?
Is
there
any
other
way
to
do
the
job
?
Survivability
of
our
strategic
forces
(
Polaris
,
mobile
and
hardened
Minuteman
,
hardened
Atlas
and
Titan
,
and
airborne
Skybolt
)
means
that
it
will
take
some
time
,
perhaps
weeks
,
to
destroy
a
strategic
force
.
War
,
under
these
circumstances
,
cannot
be
one
massive
exchange
of
nuclear
devastation
.
Forces
will
survive
a
surprise_attack
,
and
these
forces
will
give
depth
,
or
considerable
duration
,
to
the
conflict
.
The
forces
which
survive
the
initial
attack
must
be_found
and
destroyed
.
Even
mobile
forces
must
be_found
and
destroyed
.
But
,
how
does
one
go_about
the
job
of
finding
and
destroying
mobile
forces
?
They
are
not
susceptible_to
wholesale
destruction
by
ballistic_missile
.
Some_day
,
many
years
in_the_future
,
true
spacecraft
will
be
able_to
find
and
destroy
mobile
targets
.
But
until
we
have
an
effective
spacecraft
,
the
answer
to
the
hunter-killer
problem
is
manned
aircraft
.
However
,
the
aircraft
which
we
have
today
are
tied
to
large
,
``
soft
''
airfields
.
Nuclear
rockets
can
destroy
airfields
with
ease
.
Here
then
is
our
problem
:
aircraft
are
vital
to
winning
a
war
today
because
they
can
perform
those
missions
which
a
missile
is
totally
incapable_of
performing
;
but
the
airfield
,
on_which
the
aircraft
is
completely
dependent
,
is
doomed
by
the
missile
.
This
makes
today
's
aircraft
a
one-shot
,
or
one
mission
,
weapon
.
Aircraft
are
mighty
expensive
if
you
can
use
them
only
once
.
This
is
the
point
on_which
so
many
people
have
written_off
the
aircraft
in
favor
of
the
missile
.
But
remember
this
-
it
is
n't
the
aircraft
which
is
vulnerable
to
nuclear
rockets
,
it
is
the
airfield
.
Eliminate
the
vulnerability
of
aircraft
on_the_ground
and
you
have
essentially
eliminated
its
vulnerability
to
long-range
ballistic_missiles
.
There
are
four
rather
obvious
ways
to
reduce
or
eliminate
the
vulnerability
of
aircraft
on_the_ground
:
Put
aircraft
in
``
bomb-proof
''
hangars
when
they
are
on_the_ground
.
Build
long-range
aircraft
which
can
take_off
from
small
(
3000
-
foot
)
airfields
with
runways
.
If
we
could
use
all
the
small
airfields
we
have
in_this
country
,
we
could
disperse
our
strategic
aircraft
by
a
factor
of
10
or
more
.
Use
nuclear
propulsions
to
keep
our
long-range
military
aircraft
in_the_air
for
the
majority
of
their
useful
life
.
Using
very
high
thrust-to-weight
ratio
engines
,
develop
a
vertical-takeoff-and-landing
(
VTOL
)
long-range
military
aircraft
.
We
have
the
technology
today
with
which
to
build
aircraft
shelters
which
could
withstand
at_least
200
psi
.
We
could
put
a
portion
of
our
strategic
bombers
in
such
shelters
.
Large
,
long-range
bombers
can
be
developed
which
would
have
the
capability
to
take_off
from
3000
-
foot
runways
,
but
they
would
require
more
powerful
engines
than
we
have
today
.
There
is
little
enthusiasm
for
spending
money
to
develop
more
powerful
engines
because
of
the
erroneous_belief
that
the
aircraft
has
been
made
obsolete
by
the
missile
.
This
same
preoccupation
with
missiles
at
the
expense
of
aircraft
has
resulted
in
our
half-hearted
effort
to
develop
nuclear
propulsion
for
aircraft
.
One
seldom
hears
the
analogy
``
nuclear
propulsion
will
do
for
the
aircraft
what
it
has
already
done
for
the
submarine
''
.
If
,
for_some_reason
such_as
economy
,
we
are
not
going_to
develop
aircraft
nuclear
propulsion
with
a
sense
of
national
urgency
,
then
we
should
turn
our
effort
to
developing
jet_engines
with
a
thrust-to-weight
ratio
of
12
or
15
to
one
.
With
powerplants
such_as
these
,
vertical
takeoff
and
landing
combat
aircraft
could
be
built
.
For_example
,
a
12
-
to-one
engine
would
power
a
supersonic
VTOL
fighter
.
With
a
15
-
to-one
engine
,
a
supersonic
aircraft
weighing
300000
pounds
could
rise
vertically
.
The
reason
that
we
are
not
going_ahead
full
speed
to
develop
high
thrust-to-weight
engines
is
that
it
would
cost
perhaps
a_billion
dollars
-
and
you
do
n't
spend
that
sort_of
money
if
aircraft
are
obsolete
.
When
aircraft
are
no_longer
helpless
on
airfields
,
they
are
no_longer
vulnerable
to
ICBMs
.
If
our
SAC
bombers
were
,
today
,
capable_of
surviving
a
surprise
missile
attack
and
because
of
infinite
dispersion
or
long
endurance
had
the
capability
to
strike
at
Russia
again
,
and
again
,
and
again
,
those
bombers
would
unquestionably
assure
our
military
dominance
.
We
would
have
the
means
to
seek_out
and
destroy
the
enemy
's
force
-
whether
it
were
fixed
or
mobile
.
With
such
a
force
of
manned
bombers
we
could
bring
enormous
pressure
to
bear_on
an
enemy
,
and
this
pressure
would
be
selective
and
extremely
discriminating
.
No
need
to
kill
an
entire
city
and
all
its
people
because
we
lacked
the
precision
and
reconnaissance
to
selectively
disarm
the
enemy
's
military_force
.
Our
first
necessity
,
at
the
very
outset
of
war
,
is
post-attack
reconnaissance
.
In
a_few
years
we
will
have
SAMOS
(
semiautomatic
missile
observation
system
)
.
But
in
the
case
of
moving
targets
,
and
targets
which
have
limited
mobility
,
what
will
their
location
be
when
it
is
time
to
destroy
them
?
What
targets
have
we
successfully
knocked_out
?
A
ballistic_missile
cannot
,
today
,
tell
you
if
it
was
successful
or
unsuccessful
.
What
targets
still
remain
to
be
hit
?
These
crucial
questions
must
be
answered
by
post-attack
reconnaissance
.
SAMOS
will
be
hard_put
to
see
through
clouds
-
and
to
see
in
the
dark
.
Even
if
this
is
some_day
possible
,
there
remains
the
30
-
minute
time
of
flight
of
a
missile
to
its
overseas
target
.
If
the
target
can
change
its
position
significantly
during
the
30_minutes
the
missile
is
in_the_air
on
its
way
,
the
probability
of
the
missile
destroying
the
target
is
drastically
reduced
.
Pre-attack
reconnaissance
is
vital
but
only
post-attack
reconnaissance
will
allow
us
to
terminate
the
war
favorably
.
It
would
be
priceless
to
have
an
aircraft
to
gather
that
post-attack
reconnaissance
.
It
could
operate
under
the
clouds
and
perform
infrared
photography
through
clouds
and
at
night
.
It
would
be
even
more
valuable
because
that
same
aircraft
could
immediately
destroy
any
targets
it
discovered
-
no
need
to
wait
for
a
missile
to
come
all_the_way
from
the
United_States
with
the
chance
that
the
target
,
if
it
were
mobile
,
would
be
gone
.
A
large
aircraft
,
such_as
the
B-52
or
B-70
,
could
carry
perhaps
50
or
100
small
nuclear_weapons
.
Few
people
realize
that
one
kiloton
of
nuclear
explosive
power
will
create
1000
psi
overpressure
at
100
feet
.
Or
put
another
way
,
the
hardest
missile
site
planned
today
could
be
destroyed
by
placing
a
one-kiloton
warhead
(
1
20
th
the
size
of
those
used
in
Hiroshima
and
Nagasaki
)
within
100
to
200
feet
of
the
target
!
It
is
our
lack
of
extreme
accuracy
which
forces
the
use
of
very
large
yield
nuclear_weapons
.
Today
we
have
side-looking
radar
which
has
such
high
resolution
that
the
radar
picture
clearly
shows
individual
buildings
,
runways
,
taxi-ways
,
separate
spans
of
bridges
,
etc.
.
With
these
keen
``
eyes
''
and
small
nuclear_weapons
delivered
with
accuracy
,
military_forces
can
be
directly
attacked
with
minimum
damage
to
urban_areas
.
If
we
fail
to
develop
the
means
to
hunt_down
and
destroy
the
enemy
's
military_force
with
extreme
care
and
precision
,
and
if
war
comes
in
spite
of
our
most
ardent
desires
for
peace
,
our
choice
of
alternatives
will
be
truly
frightening
.
