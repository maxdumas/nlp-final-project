American
democratic
thought
,
pointed_up
the
relation
between
the
Protestant
movement
in_this
country
and
the
development
of
a
social
religion
,
which
he
called
the
American
Democratic
Faith
.
Those
familiar_with
his
work
will
remember
that
he
placed
the
incipience
of
the
democratic
faith
at
around
1850
.
And
he
describes
it
as
a
balanced
polarity
between
the
notions
of
the
free
individual
and
what
he
called
the
fundamental_law
.
I
want
to
say
more
about
Gabriel
's
so-called
fundamental_law
.
But
first
I
want
to
quote
him
on
the
relationship
that
he
found
between
religion
and
politics
in_this
country
and
what
happened
to
it
.
He
points_out
that
from
the
time
of
Jackson
on
through
World_War_1
,
,
evangelical
Protestantism
was
a
dominant
influence
in
the
social
and
political
life
of
America
.
He
terms
this
early
enthusiasm
``
Romantic_Christianity
''
and
concludes
that
its
similarity
to
democratic
beliefs
of_that
day
is
so
great
that
``
the
doctrine
of
liberty
seems
but
a
secular
version
of
its
counterpart
in
evangelical
Protestantism
''
.
Let
me
quote
him
even
more
fully
,
for
his
analysis
is
important
to
my
theme
.
He
says
:
``
Beside
the
Protestant
philosophy
of
Progress
,
as
expressed
in
radical
or
conservative
millenarianism
,
should
be
placed
the
doctrine
of
the
democratic
faith
which
affirmed
it
to
be
the
duty
of
the
destiny
of
the
United_States
to
assist
in
the
creation
of
a
better
world
by
keeping
lighted
the
beacon
of
democracy
''
.
He
specifies
,
``
In
the
middle
period
of
the
Nineteenth
Century
it
was
colored
by
Christian
supernaturalism
,
in
the
Twentieth
Century
it
was
affected
by
naturalism
.
But
in
every
period
it
has
been
humanism
''
.
And
let
me
add
,
utopianism
,
also
.
Some
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
ago
,
in
an
essay
I
called
The
Leader_Follows
-
Where
?
I
used
his
polarity
to
illustrate
what
I
thought
had
happened
to
us
in_that
form
of
liberalism
we
call
Progressivism
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
the
liberals
had
scrapped
the
balanced
polarity
and
reposed
both
liberty
and
the
fundamental_law
in
the
common_man
.
That_is_to_say
Gabriel
's
fundamental_law
had
been
so
much
modified
by
this
time
that
it
was
neither
fundamental
nor
law
any_more
.
It
is
a
weakness
of
Gabriel
's
analysis
that
he
never
seems
to
realize
that
his
so-called
fundamental_law
had
already
been
cut
loose
from
its
foundations
when
it
was
adapted
to
democracy
.
And
with
Progressivism
the
Religion_of_Humanity
was
replacing
what
Gabriel
called
Christian
supernaturalism
.
And
the
common_man
was
developing
mythic
power
,
or
charisma
,
on_his_own
.
During
the
decade
that
followed
,
the
common_man
,
as
that
piece
put
it
,
grew
uncomfortable
as
the
Voice
of
God
and
fled
from
behind
Saint_Woodrow_(_Wilson
)
only
to
learn
from
Science
,
to
his
shocked
relief
that
after_all
there
was
no
God
he
had
to
speak_for
and
that
he
was
just
an
animal
anyhow
-
that
there
was
a
chemical_formula
for
him
,
and
that
too
much
could
n't
be
expected
of
him
.
The
socialism
implicit_in
the
slogan
of
the
Roosevelt
Revolution
,
freedom
from
want
and
fear
,
seems
a
far
cry
from
the
individualism
of
the
First_Amendment
to
the
Constitution
,
or
of
the
Jacksonian
frontier
.
What
had
happened
to
the
common_man
?
French
Egalitarianism
had
had
only
nominal
influence
in_this
country
before
the
days
of
Popularism
.
The
riotous
onrush
of
industrialism
after
the
War_for_Southern_Independence
and
the
general
secular
drift
to
the
Religion_of_Humanity
,
however
,
prepared
the
way
for
a
reception
of
the
French_Revolution
's
socialistic
offspring
of
one
sort
of
another
.
The
first
of_which
to
find
important
place
in
our
federal_government
was
the
graduated
income_tax
under
Wilson
.
Moreover
the
centralization
of
our
economy
during
the
1920
s
,
the
dislocations
of
the
Depression
,
the
common
ethos
of
Materialism
everywhere
,
all
contributed
in
various
ways
to
the
face-lifting
that
replaced
Mike_Fink
and
the
Great_Gatsby
with
the
anonymous
physiognomy
of
the
Little_People
.
However
,
it
is
important
to
trace
the
philosophy
of
the
French_Revolution
to
its
sources
to
understand
the
common
democratic
origin
of
individualism
and
socialism
and
the
influence
of
the
latter
on
the
former
.
That
John_Locke
's
philosophy
of
the
social_contract
fathered
the
American_Revolution
with
its
Declaration_of_Independence
,
I
believe
,
we
generally
accept
.
Yet
,
after
Rousseau
had
given
the
social_contract
a
new
twist
with
his
notion
of
the
General
Will
,
the
same
philosophy
,
it
may
be
said
,
became
the
idea
source
of
the
French_Revolution
also
.
The
importance
of
Rousseau
's
twist
has
not
always
been
clear
to
us
,
however
.
This
notion
of
the
General
Will
gave_rise
to
the
Commune_of_Paris
in
the
Revolution
and
later
brought
Napoleon
to
dictatorship
.
And
it
is
clearly
argued
by
Lord_Percy
of
Newcastle
,
in
his
remarkable
long
essay
,
The
Heresy_of_Democracy
,
and
in
a
more
general
way
by
Voegelin
,
in
his
New_Science_of_Politics
,
that
this
same
Rousseauan
idea
,
descending
through
European
democracy
,
is
the
source
of
Marx
's
theory
of
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
.
This
is
important
to
understanding
the
position
that
doctrinaire
liberals
found
themselves
in
after
World_War_2
,
and
our
great
democratic
victory
that
brought
no
peace
.
The
long
road
that
had
taken
liberals
in_this
country
into
the
social
religion
of
democracy
,
into
a
worship
of
man
,
led
logically
to
the
Marxist
dream
of
a
classless
society
under
a
Socialist
State
.
And
the
USSR
existed
as
the
revolutionary
experiment
in
radical
socialism
,
the
ultimate
exemplar
.
And
by
the
time
the
war
ended
,
liberal
leadership
in_this
country
was
spiritually
Marxist
.
We
will
recall
that
the
still
confident
liberals
of
the
Truman
administration
gathered
with
other
Western
utopians
in
San_Francisco
to
set_up
the
legal
framework
,
finally
and
at_last
,
to
rationalize
war
-
to
rationalize
want
and
fear
-
out
of
the
world
:
the
United_Nations
.
We
of
the
liberal
led
world
got
all
set
for
peace
and
rehabilitation
.
Then
suddenly
we
found
ourselves
in
the
middle
of
another
fight
,
an
irrational
,
an
indecent
,
an
undeclared
and
immoral
war
with
our
strongest
(
and
some
had
thought
noblest
)
ally
.
During
the
next
five
years
the
leaders
of
the
Fair_Deal
reluctantly
backed_down
from
the
optimistic
expectations
of
the
New_Deal
.
During
the
next
five
years
liberal
leaders
in
the
United_States
sank
in
the
cumulative
confusion
attendant
upon
and
manifested
in
a
negative
policy
of
Containment
-
and
the
bitterest
irony
-
enforced
and
enforceable
only
by
threat
of
a
weapon
that
we
felt
the
greatest
distaste
for
but
could
not
abandon
:
the
atom_bomb
.
In
1952
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
the
G._O._P.
without
positive
program
campaigned
on
the
popular
disillusionment
with
liberal
leadership
and
won
overwhelmingly
.
All_of
this
,
I
know
,
is
recent
history
familiar
to
you
.
But
I
have
been
at
some
pains
to
review
it
as
the
drama
of
the
common_man
,
to
point_up
what
happened
to
him
under
Eisenhower
's
leadership
.
A
perceptive
journalist
,
Sam_Lubell
,
has
phrased
it
in
the
title
of
one
of
his
books
as
The
Revolt
Of
The
Moderates
.
He
opens
his
discourse
,
however
,
with
a
review
of
the
Eisenhower
inaugural
festivities
at
which
a
sympathetic
press
had
assembled
its
massive
talents
,
all
primed
to
catch
some
revelation
of
the
emerging
new
age
.
The
show
was
colorful
,
indeed
,
exuberant
,
but
the
press
for
all
its
assiduity
could
detect
no
note
of
a
fateful
rendezvous
with
destiny
.
Lubell
offers
his
book
as
an
explanation
of
why
there
was
no
clue
.
And
I
select
this
sentence
as
its
pertinent
summation
:
``
In_essence
the
drama
of
his
(
Eisenhower
's
)
Presidency
can
be
described
as
the
ordeal
of
a
nation
turned
conservative
and
struggling
-
thus_far
with
but
limited
and
precarious
success
-
to
give
effective
voice
and
force
to_that
conservatism
''
.
I
will
assume
that
we
are
all
aware
of
the
continuing
struggle
,
with
its
limited
and
precarious
success
,
toward
conservatism
.
It
has
moved_on
various
levels
,
it
has
been
clamorous
and
confused
.
Obviously
there
has
been
no
agreement
on
what
American
conservatism
is
,
or
rather
,
what
it
should
be
.
For
it
was
neglected
,
not
to
say
nascent
,
when
the
struggle
began
.
I
saw
a
piece
the
other
day
assailing
William_Buckley
,
author
of
Man_And_God_At_Yale
and
publisher
of
the
National_Review
,
as
no
conservative
at_all
,
but
an
old
liberal
.
I
would
agree
with
this
view
.
But
I
'm
not
here
to
define
conservatism
.
What
I
am
here
to
do
is
to
report
on
the
gyrations
of
the
struggle
-
a
struggle
that
amounts
to
self
redefinition
-
to
see
if
we
can
predict
its
future
course
.
One
of
the
obvious
conclusions
we
can
make
on
the
basis
of
the
last
election
,
I
suppose
,
is
that
we
,
the
majority
,
were
dissatisfied
with
Eisenhower
conservatism
.
Though
,
to_be_sure
,
we
gave
Kennedy
no
very
positive
approval
in
the
margin
of
his
preferment
.
This
is
,
however
,
symptomatic_of
our
national
malaise
.
But
before
I
try
to
diagnose
it
,
I
would
offer
other
evidence
.
I
will
mention
two
volumes
of
specific
comment
on
this
malaise
that
appeared
last
year
.
The
earlier
of
them
was
an
unofficial
enterprise
,
sponsored
by
Life
magazine
,
under
the
title
of
the
National
purpose
.
The
contributors
to
this
testament
were
all
well-known
:
a
former
Democratic
candidate
for
President
,
a
New_Deal
poet
,
the
magazine
's
chief
editorial
writer
,
two
newspaper_columnists
,
head
of
a
national
broadcasting_company
,
a
popular
Protestant
evangelist
,
etc.
.
What
I
want
to
point_out
here
is
that
all_of
them
are
ex
liberals
,
or
modified
liberals
,
with
perhaps
one
exception
.
I
suppose
we
might
classify
Billy_Graham
as
an
old
liberal
.
And
I
would
further
note
that
they
all
-
with
one
exception
again
-
sang
in
one
key
or
another
the
same
song
.
Its
refrain
was
:
``
Let
us
return
to
the
individualistic
democracy
of
our
forefathers
for
our
salvation
''
.
Adlai_Stevenson
expressed
some
reservations
about
this
return
.
Others
invoked
technology
and
common_sense
.
Only
Walter_Lippman
envisioned
the
possibility
of
our
having
``
outlived
most_of
what
we
used_to
regard_as
the
program
of
our
national
purposes
''
.
But
the
most
notable
thing
about
the
incantation
of
these
ex
liberals
was
that
the
one-time
shibboleth
of
socialism
was
conspicuously
absent
.
The
second
specific
comment
was
the
report
of
Eisenhower
's
Commission_on_National_Goals
,
titled
Goals_For_Americans
.
They
,
perhaps
,
gave
the
pitch
of
their
position
in
the
preface
where
it
was
said
that
Eisenhower
requested
that
the
Commission
be
administered
by
the
American_Assembly_of_Columbia_University
,
because
it
was
non-partisan
.
The
Commission
seems
to
represent
the
viewpoint
of_what
I
would
call
the
unconscious
liberal
,
but
not
unconscious
enough
,
to
invoke
the
now
taboo
symbolism
of
socialism
.
And
here
again
we
hear
the
same
refrain
mentioned
above
:
``
The
paramount
goal
of
the
United_States
,
set
long_ago
,
was
to
guard
the
rights
of
the
individual
,
ensure
his
development
,
enlarge
his
opportunity
''
.
This
group
is
secularist
and
their
program
tends
to
be
technological
.
But
it
is
the
need
to
undertake
these
testaments
that
I
would
submit
here
as
symptom
of
the
common_man
's
malaise
.
And
let
me
add
Murray
's
new
book
as
another
symptom
of_it
,
particularly
so
in_view_of
the
attention
Time
magazine
gave
it
when
it
came_out
recently
.
Father_Murray
goes_back
to
the
Declaration_of_Independence
,
too
,
though
I
may
add
,
with
considerably
more
historical
perception
.
I
will
reserve
discussion
of_it
for
a
moment
,
however
,
to
return
to
President_Kennedy
.
As
symptomatic_of
the
common_man
's
malaise
,
he
is
most
significant
:
a
liberal
and
a
Catholic
,
elected
by
the
skin_of_his_teeth
.
Does
that
not
suggest
to
you
an
uncertain
and
uneasy
,
not
to
say
confused
,
state
of
the
public
mind
?
What
is
the
common_man
's
complaint
?
Let
's
take
a
panoramic
look
back
over
the
course
we
have
come
.
Has
not
that
way
been
lit
always
by
the
lamp
of
liberalism
up
until
the
turning
back
under
Eisenhower
?
And
the
basic
character
of_that
liberalism
has
been
spiritual
rather
than
economic
.
Ralph_Gabriel
gave
it
the
name
of
Protestant
philosophy
of
Progress
.
But
there
's
a
subjective
side
to_that
utopian
outlook
.
