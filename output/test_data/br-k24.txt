His
eyes
were
old
and
they
never
saw
well
,
but
heated
with
whisky
they
'd
glare
at
my
noise
,
growing
red
and
raising_up
his
rage
.
I
decided
I
hated
the
Pedersen
kid
too
,
dying
in
our
kitchen
while
I
was
away
where
I
could
n't
watch
,
dying
just
to
entertain
Hans
and
making
me
go_up
snapping
steps
and
down
a
drafty
hall
,
Pa
lumped
under
the
covers
at
the
end
like
dung
covered
with
snow
,
snoring
and
whistling
.
Oh
he
'd
not
care
about
the
Pedersen
kid
.
He
'd
not
care
about
getting
waked
so
he
could
give_up
some
of
his
whisky
to
a
slit
of
a
kid
and
maybe
lose
one
of
his
hiding_places
in_the_bargain
.
That
would
make
him
mad
enough
if
he
was
sober
.
I
did
n't
hurry
though
it
was
cold
and
the
Pedersen
kid
was
in
the
kitchen
.
He
was
all
shoveled_up
like
I
thought
he
'd
be
.
I
pushed
at
his
shoulder
,
calling
his
name
.
I
think
his
name
stopped
the
snoring
but
he
did
n't
move
except
to
roll
a_little
when
I
shoved
him
.
The
covers
slid
down
his
skinny
neck
so
I
saw
his
head
,
fuzzed
like
a
dandelion
gone
to
seed
,
but
his
face
was
turned
to
the
wall
-
there
was
the
pale
shadow
of
his
nose
on
the
plaster
-
and
I
thought
,
Well
you
do
n't
look
much
like
a
pig-drunk
bully
now
.
I
could
n't
be
sure
he
was
still
asleep
.
He
was
a
cagey
sonofabitch
.
I
shook
him
a_little
harder
and
made
some
noise
.
``
Pap-pap-pap-hey
''
,
I
said
.
I
was
leaning
too
far
over
.
I
knew
better
.
He
always
slept
close_to
the
wall
so
you
had
to
lean
to
reach
him
.
Oh
he
was
smart
.
It
put
you
off
.
I
knew
better
but
I
was
thinking_of
the
Pedersen
kid
mother-naked
in
all
that
dough
.
When
his
arm
came_up
I
ducked
away
but
it
caught
me
on
the
side
of
the
neck
,
watering
my
eyes
,
and
I
backed_off
to
cough
.
Pa
was
on
his
side
,
looking
at
me
,
his
eyes
winking
,
the
hand
that
had
hit
me
a
fist
in
the
pillow
.
``
Get
the
hell
out
of
here
''
.
I
did
n't
say
anything
,
trying
to
get
my
throat
clear
,
but
I
watched
him
.
He
was
like
a
mean
horse
to
come
at
from
the
rear
.
It
was
better
,
though
,
he
'd
hit
me
.
He
was
bitter
when
he
missed
.
``
Get
the
hell
out
of
here
''
.
``
Big_Hans
sent
me
.
He
told
me
to
wake
you
''
.
``
A
fat
hell
on
Big_Hans
.
Get_out
of
here
''
.
``
He
found
the
Pedersen
kid
by
the
crib
''
.
``
Get
the
hell
out
''
.
Pa
pulled
at
the
covers
.
He
was
tasting
his
mouth
.
``
The
kid
's
froze
good
.
Hans
is
rubbing
him
with
snow
.
He
's
got
him
in
the
kitchen
''
.
``
Pedersen
''
?
``
No
,
Pa
.
It
's
the
Pedersen
kid
.
The
kid
''
.
``
Nothing
to
steal
from
the
crib
''
.
``
Not
stealing
,
Pa
.
He
was
just
lying
there
.
Hans
found
him
froze
.
That
's
where
he
was
when
Hans
found
him
''
.
Pa
laughed
.
``
I
ai
n't
hid
nothing
in
the
crib
''
.
``
You
do
n't
understand
,
Pa
.
The
Pedersen
kid
.
The
kid
''
-
``
I
god_damn
well
understand
''
.
Pa
had
his
head
up
,
glaring
,
his
teeth
gnawing
at
the
place
where
he
'd
grown
a
mustache
once
.
``
I
god_damn
well
understand
.
You
know
I
do
n't
want
to
see
Pedersen
.
That
cock
.
Why
should
I
?
What
did
he
come
for
,
hey
?
God_dammit
,
get
.
And
do
n't
come_back
.
Find_out
something
.
You
're
a
fool
.
Both
you
and
Hans
.
Pedersen
.
That
cock
.
Do
n't
come_back
.
Out
.
Out
''
.
He
was
shouting
and
breathing
hard
and
closing
his
fist
on
the
pillow
.
He
had
long
black
hairs
on
his
wrist
.
They
curled
around
the
cuff
of
his
nightshirt
.
``
Big_Hans
made
me
come
.
Big_Hans
said
''
-
``
A
fat_hell
on
Big_Hans
.
He
's
an
even
bigger
fool
than
you
are
.
Fat
,
hey
?
I
taught
him
,
dammit
,
and
I
'll
teach
you
.
Out
.
You
want
me
to
drop
my
pot
''
?
He
was_about_to
get_up
so
I
got_out
,
slamming
the
door
.
He
was
beginning
to
see
he
was
too
mad
to
sleep
.
Then
he
threw
things
.
Once
he
went_after
Hans
and
dumped
his
pot
over
the
banister
.
Pa
'd
been
shit
sick
in
that
pot
.
Hans
got
an
axe
.
He
did
n't
even
bother
to
wipe
himself
off
and
he
chopped
part
of
Pa
's
door
down
before
he
stopped
.
He
might
not
have
gone_that_far
if
Pa
had
n't
been
locked
in
laughing
fit
to
shake
the
house
.
That
pot
put
Pa
in
an
awful
good_humor
whenever
he
thought_of
it
.
I
always
felt
the
memory
was
present
in
both
of
them
,
stirring
in
their
chests
like
a
laugh
or
a
growl
,
as
eager
as
an
animal
to
be
out
.
I
heard
Pa
cursing
all_the_way
downstairs
.
Hans
had
laid
steaming
towels
over
the
kid
's
chest
and
stomach
.
He
was
rubbing
snow
on
the
kid
's
legs
and
feet
.
Water
from
the
snow
and
water
from
the
towels
had
run
off
the
kid
to
the
table
where
the
dough
was
,
and
the
dough
was
turning
pasty
,
sticking_to
the
kid
's
back
and
behind
.
``
Ai
n't
he
going_to
wake_up
''
?
``
What
about
your
pa
''
?
``
He
was
awake
when
I
left
''
.
``
What
'd
he
say
?
Did
you
get
the
whisky
''
?
``
He
said
a
fat_hell
on
Big_Hans
''
.
``
Do
n't
be
smart
.
Did
you
ask
him
about
the
whisky
''
?
``
Yeah
''
.
``
Well
''
?
``
He
said
a
fat_hell
on
Big_Hans
''
.
``
Do
n't
be
smart
.
What
's
he
going_to
do
''
?
``
Go_back
to
sleep
most
likely
''
.
``
You
'd
best
get
that
whisky
''
.
``
You
go
.
Take
the
axe
.
Pa
's
scared
to
hell
of
axes
''
.
``
Listen
to
me
,
Jorge
,
I
've
had
enough
to
your
sassing
.
This
kid
's
froze
bad
.
If
I
do
n't
get
some
whisky
down
him
he
might
die
.
You
want
the
kid
to
die
?
Do
you
?
Well
,
get
your
pa
and
get
that
whisky
''
.
``
Pa
do
n't
care
about
the
kid
''
.
``
Jorge
''
.
``
Well
he
do
n't

He

his

flung
on
me

He
do

All
he

about
is
his
whisky
and
that
dry
crack
in
his
face

pig-drunk

's
what
he

at_all

Nothing

Not
Pedersen
's
kid
neither
.
That
cock
.
Not
the
kid
neither
''
.
``
I
'll
get
the
spirits
''
,
Ma
said
.
I
'd
wound
Big_Hans
up
tight
.
I
was
ready
to
jump
but
when
Ma
said
she
'd
get
the
whisky
it
surprised
him
like
it
surprised
me
,
and
he
ran_down
.
Ma
never
went
near
the
old_man
when
he
was
sleeping_it_off
.
Not
any_more
.
Not
for
years
.
The
first
thing
every
morning
when
she
washed
her
face
she
could
see
the
scar
on
her
chin
where
he
'd
cut
her
with
a
boot
cleat
,
and
maybe
she
saw
him
heaving
it
again
,
the
dirty
sock
popping_out
as
it
flew
.
It
should
have
been
nearly
as
easy
for
her
to
remember
that
as
it
was
for
Big_Hans
to
remember
going_after
the
axe
while
he
was
still
spattered
with
Pa
's
yellow
sick
insides
.
``
No
you
won't
''
,
Big_Hans
said
.
``
Yes
,
Hans
,
if
they
're
needed
''
,
Ma
said
.
Hans
shook
his
head
but
neither
of
us
tried
to
stop
her
.
If
we
had
,
then
one
of
us
would
have
had
to
go
instead
.
Hans
rubbed
the
kid
with
more
snow
&
&
&
rubbed
&
&
&
rubbed
.
``
I
'll
get
more
snow
''
,
I
said
.
I
took
the
pail
and
shovel
and
went_out
on
the
porch
.
I
do
n't
know
where
Ma
went
.
I
thought
she
'd
gone
upstairs
and
expected
to
hear
she
had
.
She
had
surprised
Hans
like
she
had
surprised
me
when
she
said
she
'd
go
,
and_then
she
surprised
him
again
when
she
came_back
so
quick
like
she
must
have
,
because
when
I
came_in
with
the
snow
she
was
there
with
a
bottle
with
three
white
feathers
on
its
label
and
Hans
was
holding
it
angrily
by
the
throat
.
Oh
,
he
was
being
queer
and
careful
,
pawing
about
in
the
drawer
and
holding
the
bottle
like
a
snake
at
the
length
of
his
arm
.
He
was
awful
angry
because
he
'd
thought
Ma
was
going_to
do
something
big
,
something
heroic
even
,
especially
for
her
.
I
know
him
.
I
know
him
.
We
felt
the
same
sometimes
,
while
Ma
was
n't
thinking_about
that
at_all
,
not
anything
like
that
.
There
was
no
way
of
getting_even
.
It
was
n't
like
getting
cheated
at
the
fair
.
They
were
always
trying
so
you
got_to
expect
it
.
Now
Hans
had
given
Ma
something
of
his
-
we
both
had
when
we
thought
she
was
going
straight
to
Pa
-
something
valuable
;
but
since
she
did
n't
know
we
'd
given
it
to
her
,
there
was
no
easy
way
of
getting
it
back
.
Hans
cut
the
foil
off
finally
and
unscrewed
the
cap
.
He
was
put_out
too
because
there
was
only
one
way
of
understanding
what
she
'd
done
.
Ma
had
found
one
of
Pa
's
hiding_places
.
She
'd
found
one
and
she
had
n't
said
a
word
while
Big_Hans
and
I
had
hunted
and
hunted
as
we
always
did
all
winter
,
every
winter
since
the
spring
that
Hans
had
come
and
I
had
looked
in
the
privy
and
found
the
first
one
.
Pa
had
a
knack
for
hiding
.
He
knew
we
were
looking
and
he
enjoyed
it
.
But
now
Ma
.
She
'd
found
it
by_luck
most
likely
but
she
had
n't
said
anything
and
we
did
n't
know
how
long_ago
it
'd
been
or
how
many
other
ones
she
'd
found
,
saying
nothing
.
Pa
was
sure
to
find_out
.
Sometimes
he
did
n't
seem
to
because
he
hid
them
so
well
he
could
n't
find
them
himself
or
because
he
looked
and
did
n't
find
anything
and
figured
he
had
n't
hid
one
after_all
or
had
drunk
it
up
.
But
he
'd
find_out
about
this
one
because
we
were
using
it
.
A
fool
could
see
what
was
going_on
.
If
he
found_out
Ma
found
it
-
that
'd
be
bad
.
He
took_pride
in
his
hiding
.
It
was
all
the
pride
he
had
.
I
guess
fooling
Hans
and
me
took
doing
.
But
he
did
n't
figure
Ma
for
much
.
He
did
n't
figure
her
at_all
,
and
if
he
found_out
*
*
h
a
woman
*
*
h
it
'd
be
bad
.
Hans
poured
some
in
a
tumbler
.
``
You
going_to
put
more
towels
on
him
''
?
``
No
''
.
``
Why
not
?
That
's
what
he
needs
,
something
warm
to
his
skin
,
do
n't
he
''
?
``
Not
where
he
's
froze
good
.
Heat
's
bad
for
frostbite
.
That
's
why
I
only
put
towels
on
his
chest
and
belly
.
He
's_got
to
thaw
slow
.
You
ought
to
know
that
''
.
Colors
on
the
towels
had
run
.
Ma
poked
her
toe
in
the
kid
's
clothes
.
``
What
are
we
going_to
do
with
these
''
?
Big_Hans
began
pouring
whisky
in
the
kid
's
mouth
but
his
mouth
filled
without
any
getting
down
his
throat
and
in
a
second
it
was
dripping
from
his
chin
.
``
Here
,
help
me
prop
him
up
.
I
got_hold
his
mouth
open
''
.
I
did
n't
want
to
touch
him
and
I
hoped
Ma
would
do
it
but
she
kept
looking
at
the
kid
's
clothes
piled
on
the
floor
and
the
pool
of
water
by
them
and
did
n't
make
any
move
to
.
``
Come_on

Jorge

.
``
All_right

.
``
Lift

*

.
``
O.K.
,
I'm
lifting
''
.
I
took
him
by
the
shoulders
.
His
head
flopped
back
.
His
mouth
fell_open
.
The
skin
on
his
neck
was
tight
.
He
was
cold
all_right
.
``
Hold
his

.
``
His

``

``
Do

.
``
Well_Jesus

He
was
cold
all_right

I
put
my
arm
carefully
around
him

Hans
had
his
fingers
in
the
kid
's
mouth
.
``
Now
he
'll
choke

.
``
Shut_up

Just

.
He
was
cold

and
wet

I
had
my
arm
behind
his
back
