The
Theatre-By-The-Sea
,
Matunuck
,
presents
``
King_of_Hearts
''
by
Jean_Kerr
and
Eleanor_Brooke
.
Directed
by
Michael_Murray
;
settings
by
William_David_Roberts
.
The
cast
:
Producer_John_Holmes
has
chosen
a
delightful
comedy
for
his
season
's
opener
at
Matunuck
in
Jean_Kerr
's
``
King_of_Hearts
''
.
The
dialogue
is
sharp
,
witty
and
candid
-
typical
``
do
n't
eat
the
daisies
''
material
-
which
has
stamped
the
author
throughout
her
books
and
plays
,
and
it
was
obvious
that
the
Theatre-by-the-Sea
audience
liked
it
.
The
story
is
of
a
famous
strip
cartoonist
,
an
arty
individual
,
whose
specialty
is
the
American
boy
and
who
adopts
a
10
-
year
old
to
provide
him
with
fresh
idea
material
.
This
is
when
his
troubles
begin
,
not_to_mention
a
fledgling
artist
who
he
hires
,
and
who
turns_out
to
have
ideas
of
his
own
,
with
particular
respect_to
the
hero
's
sweetheart
secretary
.
John_Heffernan
,
playing
Larry_Larkin
,
the
cartoonist
,
carries_the_show
in
marvelous
fashion
.
His
portrayal
of
an
edgy
head-in-the-clouds
artist
is
virtually
flawless
.
This
may
be
unfortunate
,
perhaps
,
from
the
standpoint
of
David_Hedison
,
Providence
's
contribution
to
Hollywood
,
who
is
appearing
by
special
arrangement
with
20th_Century-Fox
.
Not
that
Mr._Hedison
does
not
make
the
most
of
his
role
.
He
does
,
and
more
.
But
the
book
is
written
around
a
somewhat
dizzy
cartoonist
,
and
it
has
to
be
that
way
.
A
word
should
be
said
for
Gary_Morgan
,
a
Broadway
youngsters
who
,
as
the
adopted
son
,
makes
life
miserable
for
nearly
everybody
and
Larkin
in
particular
.
And
for
his
playmate
,
Francis_Coletta
of
West_Warwick
,
who
has
a
bit_part
,
Billy
.
On_the_whole
,
audiences
will
like
this
performance
.
It
is
a
tremendous
book
,
lively
,
constantly
moving
,
and
the
Matunuck
cast
does_well
by
it
.
The
Newport_Playhouse
presents
``
Epitaph_For_George_Dillon
''
by
John_Osborne
and
Anthony_Creighton
,
directed
by
Wallace_Gray
.
The
cast
:
The
angriest
young_man
in
Newport
last
night
was
at
the
Playhouse
,
where
``
Epitaph_for_George_Dillon
''
opened
as
the
jazz_festival
closed
.
For
the
hero
of
this
work
by
John_Osborne
and
Anthony_Creighton
is
a
chap
embittered
by
more
than
the
lack
of
beer
during
a
jam_session
.
He
's
mad
at
a
world
he
did
not
make
.
Furthermore
,
he
's
something
of
a
scoundrel
,
an
artist
whose
mind
and
feelings
are
all
finger-tips
.
This
is
in
contrast
to
the
family
with
whom
he
boards
.
They
not_only
think
and
feel
cliches
but
live
cliches
as_well
.
It
is
into
this
household
,
one
eroded
by
irritations
that
have
tortured
the
souls
out
of
its
people
,
that
George_Dillon
enters
at
the
beginning
of
the
play
.
An
unsuccessful
playwright
and
actor
,
he
has
faith
only
in
himself
and
in
a
talent
he
is
not
sure
exists
.
By
the
end
of
the
third
act
,
the
artist
is
dead
but
the
body
lingers
on
,
a
shell
among
other
shells
.
Not
altogether
a
successful
play
,
``
Epitaph_for_George_Dillon
''
overcomes
through
sheer
vitality
and
power
what
in
a
lesser
work
might
be
crippling
.
It
is
awfully
talky
,
for_instance
,
and
not
all_of
the
talk
is
terribly
impressive
.
But
it
strikes
sparks
on_occasion
and
their
light
causes
all
else
to
be
forgotten
.
There
is
a
fine
second
act
,
as
an
example
,
one
in
which
Samuel_Groom
,
as
Dillon
,
has
an
opportunity
to
blaze_away
in
one
impassioned
passage
after
another
.
This
is
an
exciting
young
actor
to
watch
.
Just
as
exciting
but
in
a
more
technically
proficient
way
is
Laura_Stuart
,
whose
complete
control
of
her
every
movement
is
lovely
to
watch
.
Miss_Stuart
is
as
intensely
vibrant
as
one
could
wish
,
almost
an
icy
shriek
threatening
to
explode
at
any
moment
.
Also
fine
are
Sue_Lawless
,
as
a
mother
more
protective
and
belligerent
than
a
female
spider
and
just
as
destructive
,
Harold_Cherry
,
as
her
scratchy
spouse
,
and
Hildy_Weissman
,
as
a
vegetable
in
human
form
.
Wallace_Gray
has
directed
a
difficult
play
here
,
usually
well
,
but
with
just
a_bit
too
much
physical
movement
in
the
first
act
for
my
taste
.
Still
,
his
finale
is
put_together
with
taste
and
a
most
sensitive
projection
of
that
pale
sustenance
,
despair
.
The_Warwick_Musical_Theater
presents
``
Where's_Charley
?
''
with
music
and
lyrics
by
Frank_Loesser
,
directed
by
Christopher_Hewett
,
choreography
by
Peter_Conlow
,
musical
direction
by
Samuel_Matlowsky
.
The
cast
:
Everybody
fell_in_love
with
Amy
again
last
night
at
the
Warwick_Musical_Theater
,
and
Shelley_Berman
was
to
blame
.
One
of
the
finest
soft_shoe
tunes
ever
invented
,
``
Once_in_Love_with_Amy
''
is
also
,
of_course
,
one
of
the
most
tantalizingly
persistent
of
light
love_lyrics
to
come_out
of
American
musical_comedy
in
our
era
.
So
the
audience
last
night
was
all
ears
and
eyes
just
after
Act
2
,
got
a
rousing
opening
chorus
,
``
Where's_Charley
?
''
,
and
Berman
sifted_out
all
alone
on
the
stage
with
the
ambling
chords
and
beat
of
the
song
just
whispering
into
being
.
It
is
greatly
to
Berman
's
credit
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
outdo
Ray_Bolger
.
He
dropped
his
earlier
and
delightful
hamming
,
which
is
about
the
only
way
to
handle
the
old
war_horse
called
``
Charley's_Aunt
''
,
and
let
himself
go_with
as
an
appealing
an
``
Amy
''
as
anybody
could
ask
.
In_brief
,
Berman
played
himself
and
not
Bolger
.
The
big
audience
started
applauding
even
before
he
had
finished
.
The
whole
production
this
week
is
fresh
and
lively
.
The
costumes
are
stunning
evocations
of
the
voluminous
gowns
and
picture_hats
of
the
Gibson_Girl
days
.
The
ballet
work
is
on_the_nose
,
especially
in
the
opening
number
by
``
The_New_Ashmolean_Marching_Society
and
Students_'_Conservatory_Band
''
,
along
with
a
fiery
and
sultry
Brazilian
fantasia
later
.
Berman
,
whose
fame
has
rested
in
recent
years
on
his
skills
as
a
night_club
monologist
,
proved
himself
very
much
at_home
in
musical_comedy
.
Sparrow
size
Virginia_Gibson
,
with
sparkling
blue
eyes
and
a
cheerful
smile
,
made
a
suitably
perky
Amy
,
while
Melisande_Congdon
,
as
the
real
aunt
,
was
positively
monumental
in
the
very
best
Gibson_Girl
manner
.
All_told
,
``
Where's_Charley
?
''
ought
not
to
be
missed
.
It
has
a
fast
pace
,
excellent
music
,
expert
direction
,
and
not_only
a
good
comedian
,
but
an
appealing
person
in
his
own
right
,
Mr._Berman
.
The
Broadway_Theater_League_of_Rhode_Island
presents
C._Edwin_Knill
's
and
Martin_Tahse
's
production
of
``
Fiorello
!
''
at
Veterans_Memorial_Auditorium
.
The
book

music
by
Jerry_Bock

lyrics

Sheldon_Harnick

choreography

scenery
,
costumes
and

and
the
production
was
directed
by
Mr._Abbott
.
The
cast
:
This
is
one
of
the
happier
events
of
the
season
.
The
company
which
performed
the
Pulitzer_Prize
musical
here
last
night
and
will
repeat
it
twice
today
is
full
of
bounce
,
the
politicians
are
in
fine
voice
,
the
chorines
evoke
happy
memories
,
and
the
Little_Flower
rides
to
break
a
lance
again
.
I
saw
``
Fiorello
!
''
performed
in
New_York
by
the
original
cast
and
I
think
this
company
is
every_bit
as
good
,
and
perhaps
better
.
Certainly
in
the
matter
of
principals
there
is
nothing
lacking
.
Bob_Carroll
may
not
bear
quite
as
close
a
physical
resemblance
to
LaGuardia
as
Tom_Bosley
does
,
but
I
was
amazed
at
the
way
he
became
more_and_more
Fiorello
as
the
evening
progressed
,
until
one
had
to
catch_one's_self_up
and
remember
that
this
was
n't
really
LaGuardia
come_back
among
us
again
.
Then
Rudy_Bond
was
simply
grand
as
Ben
,
the
distraught
Republican_Party
district
chieftain
.
And
Paul_Lipson
,
as
Morris
,
the
faithful
one
who
never
gets
home
to
his
Shirley
's
dinner
,
was
fine
,
too
.
As
for
the
ladies
,
they
were
full
of
charm
,
and
sincerity
,
and
deep
and
abiding
affection
for
this
hurrying
driving
,
honest
,
little
man
.
Charlotte_Fairchild
was
excellent
as
the
loyal
Marie
,
who
became
the
second
Mrs._LaGuardia
,
singing
and
acting
with
remarkable
conviction
.
Jen_Nelson
,
as
Thea
,
his
first
wife
,
managed
to
make
that
short
role
impressive
.
And
little
Zeme_North
,
a
Dora
with
real
spirit
and
verve
,
was
fascinating
whether
she
was
singing
of
her
love
for
Floyd
,
the
cop
who
becomes
sewer
commissioner
and
then
is
promoted
into
garbage
,
or
just
dancing
to
display
her
exuberant
feelings
.
Such
fascinating
novelties
in
the
score
as
the
fugual
treatment
of
``
On_the_Side_of_the_Angels
''
and
``
Politics_and_Poker
''
were
handled
splendidly
,
and
I
thought
Rudy_Bond
and
his
band
of
tuneful
ward-heelers
made
``
Little_Tin_Box
''
even
better
than
it
was
done
by
the
New_York
cast
;
all
the
words
of
its
clever
lyrics
came_through
with
perfect
clarity
.
The
party
at
Floyd
's
penthouse
gave
the
``
chorines
''
a
chance
for
a
nostalgic
frolic
through
all
those
hackneyed
routines
which
have
become
a
classic
choreographic
statement
of
the
era
's
nonsense
.
LaGuardia
's
multi
lingual
rallies
,
when
he
is
running
for
Congress
,
are
well
staged
,
and
wind_up
in
a
wild
Jewish
folk-dance
that
is
really
great
musical_theater
.
Martin_Tahse
has
established
quite
a
reputation
for
himself
as
a
successful
stager
of
touring
productions
.
Not
a
corner
has
been
visibly
cut
in
this
one
.
The
sets
are
remarkably
elaborate
for
a
road-show
that
does
n't
pause
long
in
any
one
place
,
and
they
are
devised
so_that
they
shift
with
a
minimum
of
interruption
or
obtrusiveness
.
(
Several
times
recently
I
have
wondered
whether
shows
were
being
staged
for
the
sake
of
the
script
or
just
to
entertain
the
audience
with
the
spectacle
of
scenery
being
shifted
right
in_front_of
their
eyes
.
I'm
glad
to
say
there
's
none
of
that
distraction
in
this
``
Fiorello
!
''
)
It
has
all
been
done
in
superb
style
,
and
the
result
is
a
show
which
deserves
the
support
of
every
person
hereabouts
who
enjoys
good
musical_theater
.
Loew_'s_Theater
presents
``
Where_the_Boys_are
''
,
an
MGM
picture
produced
by
Joe_Pasternak
and
directed
by
Henry_Levin
from
a
screenplay
by
George_Wells
.
The
cast
:
Since
the
hero
,
a
sterling
and
upright
fellow
,
is
a
rich
Brown
senior
,
while
two
Yalies
are
cast
as
virtual
rapists
,
I
suppose
I
should
disqualify
myself
from
sitting
in
judgment
on
``
Where_the_Boys_are
''
,
but
I
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
.
Instead
-
and
not
just
to
prove
my
objectivity
-
I
hasten
to
report
that
it
's
a
highly
amusing
film
which
probably
does
a
fairly
accurate
job
of
reporting
on
the
Easter
vacation
shenanigans
of
collegians
down
in
Fort_Lauderdale
,
and
that
it
seems
to
come_to_grips
quite
honestly
with
the
moral
problem
that
most
commonly
vexes
youngsters
in
this
age_group
-
that_is_to_say
,
sex
.
The
answers
the
girls
give
struck
me
as
reasonably
varied
and
healthily
individual
.
If
most_of
them
were
n't
exactly
specific
-
well
,
that
's
the
way
it
is
in
life
,
I
guess
.
But
at_least
it
's
reassuring
to
see
some
teenagers
who
do
n't
profess
to
know
all
the
answers
and
are
thinking_about
their
problems
instead
.
``
Where_the_Boys_Are
''
also
has
a
juvenile
bounce
that
makes_for
a
refreshing
venture
in
comedy
.
There
are
some
sharp
and
whipping
lines
and
some
hilariously
funny
situations
-
the
best
of
the
latter
being
a
mass
impromptu
plunge
into
a
nightclub
tank
where
a
``
mermaid
''
is
performing
.
Most
of
the
female
faces
are
new
,
or
at_least
not
too
familiar
.
Dolores_Hart
,
is
charming
in
a
leading
role
,
and
quite
believable
.
I
was
delighted
with
Paula_Prentiss
'
comedy
performance
,
which
was
as
fresh
and
unstilted
as
one
's
highest
hopes
might
ask
.
A_couple_of
the
males
made
good
comedy
,
too
-
Jim_Hutton
and
Frank_Gorshin
.
The
only
performance
which
was
too
soft
for
me
was
that
of
Yvette_Mimieux
,
but
since
someone
had
to
become
the
victim
of
despoilers
,
just
to
emphasize
that
such
things
do
happen
at
these
fracases
,
I
suppose
this
was
the
attitude
the
part
called_for
.
I
must
say
,
however
,
that
I
preferred
the
acting
that
had
something
of
a
biting
edge
to
it
.
To
anyone
who
remembers
Newport
at
its
less_than
maximum
violence
,
this
view
of
what
the
boys
and
girls
do
in
the
springtime
before
they
wing
north
for
the
Jazz_Festival
ought
to
prove
entertaining
.
The
second
feature
,
``
The_Price_of_Silence
''
,
is
a
British
detective_story
that
will
talk_your_head_off
.
