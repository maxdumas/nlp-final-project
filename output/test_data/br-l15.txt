``
Through
a
door
conveniently
unlocked
''
,
Madden
supplemented
.
``
That
damn
door
''
,
said
the
police_chief
.
``
A
gift_horse
to
be
viewed
with
suspicion
''
.
Madden
's
dark
face
wore
a
meditative
look
.
``
If
there
was
collusion
between
an
outside
murderer
and
a
member
of
the
household
it
would
be
an
elementary
precaution
to
check
on
the
door
later
.
And
it
makes
a
very
poor
red_herring
for
an
inside_job
.
Much
better
to
break
a
cellar
window
''
.
``
Do
n't
forget
,
there
was
the
hope
it
would
pass
for
a
natural
death
''
,
Pauling
reminded
him
.
``
Well
,
with
a
house
as
big
as
that
there
must
be
at_least
one
cellar
window
that
would
n't
be
noticed
right_away
unless
there
was
a
police_investigation
''
.
``
Yeah
.
And
a
pane_of_glass
is
n't
hard
to
''
-
The
telephone
interrupted
him
.
He
scooped_up
the
receiver
and
said
,
``
Police_chief
''
,
into
the
mouthpiece
,
and
then
,
``
Oh
yes
,
Mr._Benson
.
I
was
hoping
I
'd
hear
from
you
today
''
.
With
his
free
hand
he
pulled
a
pad
and
pencil
toward
him
and
began
to
make
notes
as
he
listened
,
saying
,
``
Uh-huh
''
and
``
I
see
''
at
intervals
.
At_last
he
said
,
``
Well
,
thank_you
for
calling
,
Mr._Benson
.
Although
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
and
we
've
been
handling
it
as
one
I
'm
glad
to
have
it
made
official
''
.
He
hung_up
.
``
Coroner
''
,
he
said
to
Madden
.
``
He
's
just
heard
from
the
pathologist
who
says
Mrs._Meeker
apparently
died
from
suffocation
''
.
Pauling
looked
at
his
notes
.
``
Many
minute
hemorrhages
in
the
lungs
;
particles
of
lint
and
thread
in
the
mouth
and
nostrils
.
Scrapings
from
the
bed_linen
identical
with
the
lint
and
thread
found
in
the
nasal
and
oral_cavities
.
No
other
cause
of
death
apparent
.
Trachea
clear
of
mucus
and
foreign
objects
.
Brain
examined
for
thrombosis
,
clot
or
hemorrhage
.
No
signs
of
these
,
no
gross
hemorrhage
of
lungs
,
heart
,
brain
or
stomach
''
.
He
paused
.
``
That
's_about_it
.
Oh
,
the
time
of
death
.
The
duration
of
the
digestive
process
varies
,
the
pathologist
says
,
but
the
empty
stomach
and
the
findings
in
the
upper
gastrointestinal
tract
indicate
that
Mrs._Meeker
died
several
hours
after
her
seven
o_'_clock
dinner
.
Probably
around
midnight
,
give_or_take
an
hour
either
way
''
.
Pauling
paused
again
.
``
So
there
it
is
''
,
he
said
.
``
Not
your
problem
,
of_course
,
unless
Johnston
and
the
murderer
are
one_and_the_same
''
.
They
discussed
this
possibility
.
However
likely
it
was
,
Pauling
said
,
he
could
n't
limit
himself
to
it
.
He
had
to
look_for
other
prospects
,
other
motives
until
more
conclusive
evidence
pointing
to
Johnston
came
to
light
.
Madden
,
with
his
investigation
centered_on
the
fraud
,
said
that
tomorrow
he
would
go_to
the_Bronx
bank
through
which
Mrs._Meeker
's
checks
to
Johnston
had
cleared
.
Arthur_Williams
had
to
be
located
,
they
agreed
.
He
might
have
been
in
collusion
with
Johnston
on
the
fraud
;
he
might
be
Mrs._Meeker
's
murderer
or
have
played
some
part
in
her
death
.
This
was
Madden
's
suggestion
;
the
police_chief
shook
his
head
over
it
.
If
Arthur_Williams
was
involved
in
the
fraud
or
the
murder
,
then
he
too
had
another
identity
.
No
one
the
Medfield
police
had
questioned
professed
to
know
any
more
about
him
than
about
Johnston
.
Scholarship
applicant
?
Pauling
looked
doubtful
.
Madden
explained
that
he
was
thinking_of
an
application
sent
directly
to
Mrs._Meeker
.
Then
he
asked
to
use
the
phone
and
called
Brian_Thayer
,
who
said
that
he
was
just
leaving
to
keep
a
lunch
date
but
would
be
home
by
two
o
'
clock
.
Madden
said
that
he
would
see
him
at
two
and
made
another
call
,
this
one
to
Mrs._Meeker
's
lawyers
.
Mr._Hohlbein
was
out
for
the
day
,
but
Mr._Garth
would
be
free
at
one-thirty
.
The
secretary
's
tone
indicated
that
an
appointment
at
such
short
notice
was
a
concession
for
which
Madden
should
be
duly
grateful
.
He
inferred
that
Hohlbein
and
Garth
were
high-priced
lawyers
.
He
had
lunch
with
Pauling
.
Promptly
at
one-thirty
he
entered
Hohlbein
and
Garth
's
elegant
suite
of
offices
in
Medfield
's
newest
professional
building
.
He
disliked
Garth
on
sight
,
conservative
clothes
and
haircut
,
smile
a
shade
too
earnestly
boyish
for
a
man
who
must
be
well
into
his
thirties
,
handclasp
too
consciously
quick
and
firm
.
Youngish
man
on_the_make
,
Madden
labeled
him
,
and
was
ready
to
guess
that
in
a
correct
,
not
too
pushing
fashion
,
the
junior
partner
of
the
firm
had
political
ambitions
;
that
Mrs._Garth
would
be
impeccably
suitable
as
the
wife
of
a
rising
young
lawyer
;
that
there
were
three
children
,
two
boys
and
a
girl
;
that
she
was
active
in
the
Woman
's
Club
and
he
in
Lions
,
Rotary
,
and
Jaycee
;
and
finally
,
that
neither
of
them
had
harbored
an
unorthodox
opinion
since
their
wedding_day
.
Madden
knew
that
he
could
be
completely
wrong
about
all
this
,
but
also
knew
that
he
would
go
right
on
disliking
Garth
.
Garth
was
prepared
to
be
helpful
in
what
he
referred
to
with
fastidious
distaste
as
this
unfortunate
Johnston
affair
,
which
would
not
,
he
said
more
than
once
,
have
ever
come_about
if
Mrs._Meeker
had
only
seen
fit
to
consult
Mr._Hohlbein
or
him
about
it
.
Madden
regretted
not
being
able
to
find_fault_with
so
true
a
statement
.
He
asked
to
see
a
copy
of
Mrs._Meeker
's
will
.
Garth
brought
one
out
.
The
date
,
October
8
,
1957
,
immediately
caught
the
inspector
's
eye
.
``
Fairly
recent
''
,
he
remarked
.
``
Was
she
in
the
habit
of
making
new
wills
''
?
``
Oh
no
.
She
had
reason
to
change
the
one
she
made
right
after
Mr._Meeker
's
death
.
Her
estate
had
grown
considerably
.
She
wanted
to
make
a
more
equitable
distribution
of
it
among
the
groups
that
would
benefit
the
most
;
particularly
the
scholarship
fund
.
At
the
time
the
will
was
drawn
Mr._Hohlbein
mentioned
to
me
how
mentally
alert
she
seemed
for
her
age
,
knowing
just
what
changes
she
wanted
made
and_so_forth
''
.
Garth
hesitated
.
``
Mr._Hohlbein
and
I
have
noticed
some
lapses
since
,
though
.
Most_of
them
this
past
year
,
I
'd
say
.
Even
two
or
three
years
ago
I
doubt
that
she
'd
have
become
involved
in
this
unfortunate
Johnston
affair
.
She
'd
have
consulted
us
,
you
see
.
She
always
did
before
,
and
showed
the
utmost
confidence
in
whatever
we
advised
''
.
The
inspector
nodded
,
doubting
this
.
Mrs._Meeker
had
n't
struck
him
as
ready
to
seek
anyone
's
advise
,
least_of_all
Garth
's
.
With
her
sharp_tongue
she
'd
have
cut
his
pompousness
to
ribbons
.
It
would
have
been
Hohlbein
who
handled
her
affairs
.
Madden
settled
back
to
read
the
will
.
He
skimmed_over
the
millions
that
went
to
Meeker_Park
,
Medfield_Hospital
,
the
civic_center
,
the
Public_Health_Nursing_Association
,
the
library
,
and_so_on
,
pausing
when
he
came
to
the
scholarship
fund
.
Two
millions
were
added
to
what
had
been
set_aside
for
it
in
Mrs._Meeker
's
lifetime
,
and
the
proviso
made
that
as
long
as
Brian_Thayer
continued
to
discharge
his
duties
as
administrator
of
the
fund
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
board_of_trustees
(
hereinafter
appointed
by
the
bank
administering
the
estate
)
he
was
to
be
retained
in
his
present
capacity
at
a
salary
commensurate
with
the
increased
responsibilities
enlargement
of
the
fund
would
entail
.
A
splendid
vote_of_confidence
in
Thayer
,
Madden
reflected
.
Tenure
,
too
.
Very
nice
for
him
.
He
went_on
to
personal
bequests
,
a
list
of
names
largely
unknown
to
him
.
Twenty-five_thousand
to
each
of
the
great-nieces
in
Oregon
(
not
much
to
blood_relatives
out
of
millions
)
ten_thousand
to
this
friend
and
that
,
five_thousand
to
another
;
to
Brian_Thayer
,
the
sum
of
ten_thousand
dollars
;
to
the
Pecks
,
ten_thousand
each
;
to
Joan_Sheldon
the
conditional
bequest
of
ten_thousand
to
be
paid
to
her
in
the
event
that
she
was
still
in
Mrs._Meeker
's
employ
at
the
time
of
the
latter
's
death
.
(
No
additional
five_thousand
for
each
year
after
Joan
's
twenty-first
birthday
;
Mrs._Meeker
had
n't
got_around_to
taking_care
of
that
.
)
Too_bad
,
Madden
thought
.
Joan_Sheldon
had
earned
the
larger
bequest
.
Mr._Hohlbein
was
left
twenty_thousand
,
Garth
ten
.
There
were
no
other
names
Madden
recognized
.
Arthur_Williams
's
might
well
have
been
included
,
he
felt
.
Mrs._Meeker
had
spent
a
small_fortune
on
a
search
for
him
but
had
made
no
provision
for
him
in
her
will
if
he
should
be
found
after
her
death
,
and
had
never
mentioned
his
name
to
her
lawyers
.
Madden
took_up
this
point
with
Garth
,
who
shrugged
it
off
.
``
Old
people
have
their
idiosyncrasies
''
.
``
This
one
came
a_bit
high
at
thirty_thousand
or
more
''
.
``
Well
,
she
had
a
number
of
them
where
money
was
concerned
''
,
Garth
said
.
``
Sometimes
we
'd
have
trouble
persuading
her
to
make
tax-exempt
charitable
contributions
,
and
I
've
known
her
to
quarrel
with
a
plumber
over
a
bill
for
fixing
a
faucet
;
the
next
moment
she
'd
put
another
half
million
into
the
scholarship
fund
or
thirty_thousand
into
something
as
impractical
as
this
unfortunate
Johnston
affair
.
There
was
no
telling
how
she
'd
react
to
spending
money
''
.
Madden
inquired
next
about
the
audit
of
the
scholarship
fund
.
There
was
an
annual
audit
,
Garth
informed
him
.
No
discrepancies
or
shortages
had
ever
been
found
.
Brian_Thayer
was
a
thoroughly
honest
and
competent
administrator
.
His
salary
had
reached
the
ten_thousand
mark
.
His
expenses
ran
another
four
or
five_thousand
.
The
lawyer
did
n't
know
him
very
well
although
he
saw
him
occasionally
at
some
dinner_party
-
Thayer
,
like
himself
,
Madden
reflected
,
was
the
extra
man
so
prized
by
hostesses
-
and
found
him
easy
enough
to
talk
to
.
But
he
did
n't
play
golf
,
did
n't
seem
to
belong_to
any
local
clubs
-
his
work
took
him
away
a_lot
,
of_course
-
which
probably
accounted_for
his
tendency
to
keep_to_himself
.
Garth
's
glance
began
to
flicker
to
his
watch
.
He
said
that
he
had
already
told
the
police_chief
that
he
did
n't
know
what
insurance
man
had
recommended
Johnston
to
Mrs._Meeker
.
He
would
offer
no
theory
to
account_for
her
murder
.
The
whole_thing
,
his
manner
conveyed
,
was
so
far
outside
the
normal
routine
of
Hohlbein
and
Garth
that
it
practically
demanded
being
swept_under_the_rug
.
No_doubt
Mrs._Meeker
had
snubbed
him
many_a
time
and
he
felt
no
grief
over
her
passing
.
Even_so
,
Madden
's
dislike
of
the
suave
,
correct
lawyer
deepened
.
It
would
be
all_right
with
him
,
he
decided
,
if
his
investigation
of
the
fraud
,
with
its
probable
by-product
of
murder
,
led
to
Garth
's
door
.
Motive
?
Ten-thousand-dollar
bequest
.
At_first_glance
,
not
much
of
a
motive
for
a
man
of
his
standing
;
but
for
all
his
air
of
affluence
,
who
could
tell
what
his
private
financial
picture
was
?
The
inspector
knew
as
he
left
that
this
was
wishful_thinking
.
Nevertheless
,
he
made
a
mental
note
to
look_into
Garth
's
financial
background
.
Brian_Thayer
had
a
downtown
address
.
He
lived
in
an
apartment_house
not
over
three
or
four
years
old
,
a
reclaimed
island
of
landscaped
brick
and
glass
on
the
fringe
of
the
business_district
.
He
occupied
a
two
bedroom
apartment
on
the
fourth
floor
,
using
the
second
bedroom
as
his
office
.
Airy
and
bright
,
the
apartment
was
furnished
with
good
modern
furniture
,
rugs
,
and
draperies
.
Done
by
a
professional
decorator
,
Madden
thought
,
and
somehow
as
impersonal
,
as
unremarkable
as
its
occupant
.
In
Dunston
the
rent
would
run
close_to
two_hundred
a
month
;
in
Medfield
,
perhaps
twenty-five
less
,
not
all_of
it
paid
by
Thayer
,
who
could
charge
off
one
room
on
his
expense_account
.
He
took
Madden
into
the
room
he
used
as
an
office
.
It
contained
a
desk
,
files
,
a
typewriter
on
a
stand
,
and
two
big
leather
armchairs
.
A
newspaper
open
at
stock-market
reports
lay
on
one
of
them
.
Thayer
folded
it
up
and
offered
a
drink
.
The
inspector
declined
.
To
begin
the
interview
,
he
asked
if
Thayer
,
with
more
time
to
think
it
over
,
could
add
to
what
he
had
said
the
other
day
about
Johnston
.
Thayer
shook
his
head
.
``
It
's
all
I
think_about
,
too
.
That
and
her
death
.
It
's
still
unbelievable
that
it
was
murder
.
For
all
her
domineering
ways
,
I
can
n't
conceive_of
her
having
had
a
deadly
enemy
''
.
