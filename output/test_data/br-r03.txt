Needless
to
say
,
I
was
furious
at
this
unparalleled
intrusion
upon
free_enterprise
.
How
dared
they
demand
to
``
snoop
''
in_private
financial
records
,
disbursements
,
confidential
contracts
and
agreements
?
``
It
is
as
though
''
,
I
said
on
the
historic
three-hour
,
coast-to-coast
radio_broadcast
which
I
bought
(
following
Father_Coughlin
and
pre_empting
the
Eddie_Cantor
,
Manhattan_Merry-go-round
and
Major_Bowes
shows
)
``
That
Man
in
the
White_House
,
like
some
despot
of
yore
,
insisted
on
reading
my
diary
,
raiding
my
larder
and
ransacking
my
lingerie
!
''
My
impassioned
plea
for
civil_rights
created
a
landslide
of
correspondence
and
one
sponsor
even
asked
me
to
consider
replacing
the
Eddie_Cantor
comedy
hour
on
a
permanent
basis
.
But
what
quarter
could
a
poor
defenseless
woman
expect
from
a
dictator
who
would
even
make
so
bold
as
to
close
all_of
the
banks
in
our
great
nation
?
The
savage
barbarian
hordes
of
red
Russian_Communism
descended
on
the
Athens
that
was
mighty
Metronome
,
sacking
and
despoiling
with
their
Bolshevistic
battle
cry
of
``
Soak
the
rich
'
!
After
an
unspeakable
siege
,
lasting
the
better
part
of
two
months
,
it
was
announced
that
the
studio
''
owed
``
the
government
a
tax
debt
in_excess
of
eight
million
dollars
while
I
,
who
had
always
remained
aloof
from
such
iniquitous
practices
as
paying
taxes
on
the
salary
I
had
earned
and
the
little
I
legally
inherited
as
Morris
'
helpless
relict
,
was
''
stung
``
with
a
personal
bill
of
such
astronomical
proportions
as
to
''
wipe_out
``
all_but
a
fraction
of
my
poor
,
hard-come-by
savings
.
I
was
also
publicly
reprimanded
,
dragged_through_the_mud
by
the
radical
press
and
made
a
figure
of
fun
by
such
leftist
publications
as
The
New_Republic
,
The
New_Yorker
,
Time
and
the
Christian_Science
Monitor
.
It
was
then
that
I
availed
myself
of
the
rights
of
a
citizen
and
declared
the
income_tax
unconstitutional
.
The
litigation
was
costly
and
seemingly
endless
.
I
fought
like
a
tigress
but
by
the
time
I
appealed
my
case
to
the
Supreme_Court
(
1937
)
,
Mr._Roosevelt
and
his
``
henchmen
''
had
done
their
``
dirty
work
''
all_too
well
,
even
going
so_far
as
to
attempt
to
``
pack
''
the
highest
tribunal
in
the
land
in_order_to
defeat
little
me
.
Presidential
coercion
had
succeeded
not_only
in
poisoning
the
courtiers
,
``
toadies
''
and
sycophants
of
the
``
bench
''
against
me
,
but
it
had
been
so
far-reaching
as
to
discourage
any
lawyer
in
the
nation
from
representing
me
!
I
was
ready
,
like
Portia
,
to
present
my
own
brief
.
But
the
Supreme_Court
would
n't
even
hear
my
case
!
My
plea
was
unanimously
voted_down
and
``
thrown_out
''
.
Again
,
my
name
was_on
all
the
front
pages
.
I
was
,
it
seemed
,
persona_non_grata
in
every_quarter
,
but
not
entirely
without
a
staunch
following
of
noted
political
thinkers
and
students
of
jurisprudence
.
As
Charles_Evans_Hughes
said
,
``
Miss_Poitrine
's
limitations
as
an
actress
are
exceeded
only
by
her
logic
as
a
litigant
''
.
Albert_Einstein
was
quoted
as
saying
:
``
The
workings
of
the
woman
's
mind
amaze
me
''
.
Henry_Ford
spoke
of
me
as
``
utterly
astounding
''
.
Heywood_Broun
wrote
:
``
Belle_Poitrine
is
the_most
original
thinker
since
Caligula
''
,
and
even
F._D._R.
had
to
concede
that
``
if
the
rest
of_this
nation
showed
the
foresight
and
patriotism
of
Miss_Poitrine
,
America
would
rapidly
resemble
ancient
Babylon
and
Nineveh
''
.
Not_only
were
the
court
costs
prohibitive
,
but
I
was
subjected
to
crippling
fines
,
in_addition
to
usurious
interest
on
the
unpaid
``
debts
''
which
the
governmen
claimed
that
Metronome
and
I
owed
-
a
severe
financial
blow
.
Nor
,
as
Manny
said
,
had
the
notoriety
done
my
career
``
any
good
''
.
My
enemies
were
only_too
anxious
to
level
against
me
such
charges
as
``
reactionary
''
,
``
robber
baroness
''
,
and
even
``
traitor
''
!
Traitor
indeed
!
I
point
now
with_pride
to
the
fact
that
,
long
ere
the
Committee
on
Un-American_Activities
,
the
Minute_Women
,
the
Economic_Council
and
other
such
notable
``
watchdog
''
organizations
were
so_much
as
heard
of
,
I
was
Hollywood
's
leading
bulwark
against
communism
,
fighting
single-handedly
``
creeping
socialism
''
against
such
insuperable
odds
as
the
Fascio-Communist
troops
of
the
NRA
,
PWA
,
WPA
,
CCC
and
an
army
of
more_than
twenty-two
million
mercenaries
whom
F._D._R.
employed
secretly
,
through
the
transparent
ruse
of
regular
``
relief
''
checks
.
Needless
to
say
,
my
art
suffered
drastically
during
this
turbulent
period
.
Could
it
do
otherwise
?
Even_though
I
have
always
had
a
genius
for
``
throwing
myself
into
''
every
role
and
``
playing
it
for
all
it
's
worth
''
,
no
actress
can
be
expected
to
do
her
best
work
when
her
fortune
,
her
reputation
,
her
livelihood
,
her
home
and
her
nation
itself
are
all
imperilled
.
Such
sweeping
distractions
are
hardly
conducive
to
``
Oscar
''
winning
performances
.
I
tried
my
hardest
,
with
little
help
,
may
I
say
,
from
my
husband
and
leading_man
,
but
somehow
the
outside
pressures
were
too
severe
.
Having
(
through
my
unflagging
effort
and
devotion
)
achieved
stardom
,
a
fortune
and
a
world-renowned
wife
at
an
age
when
most
young_men
are
casting
their
first
vote
,
Letch
proceeded
to
neglect
them
all
.
Never
a
``
quick
study
''
,
he
now
made
no
attempt
to
learn
his
``
lines
''
and
many_a
mile
of
film
was
wasted
,
many_a
scene
-
sometimes
involving
as_many
as
a_thousand
fellow
thespians
-
was
taken
thirty
,
forty
,
fifty
times
because
Miss_Poitrine
's
co-star
and
``
helpmate
''
had
never
learned
his
part
.
Each
time
Letch
``
went_up
''
in
his
``
lines
''
,
I
was
the
one
to
be
patient
,
helpful
and
apologetic
while
he
indulged
in
outbursts
of
temperament
,
profanity
and
abuse
,
blaming
others
,
going
into
``
sulks
''
and
,
on
more
occasions
than
I
care
to
count
,
storming
off
the
``
set
''
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
As
for
his
finances
,
I
was
never
privileged
to
know
exactly
how
much
money
Letch
had
``
salted_away
''
.
It
was
I
who
paid
for
our
little
home
,
the
food
,
the
liquor
,
the
servants
-
even
Letch
's
bills
at
his
tailor
and
the
Los_Angeles
Athletic_Club
.
Never
once
did
he
buy
me
a
single
gift
and
for
our
third
anniversary
he
gave
me
a
dislocated
jaw
.
(
But
that
is
another
story
.
)
As
for
his
private
monies
,
they
were
rapidly
dissipated
in
drinking
,
gaming
and
carousing
.
More_than
once
I
was
confronted
by
professional
gamblers
,
``
bookies
''
,
loan
``
sharks
''
,
gangsters
,
``
thugs
''
and
``
finger
men
''
-
people
of
a
class
I
did
not
even
know
existed
-
to
repay
my
husband
's
staggering
losses
,
``
or_else
''
.
I
shuddered
to
think
that
someone
so
dear
to
me
could
even
associate
with
such
a
sinister
milieu
.
And
at
three
different
times
during
our
turbulent
marriage
strange
girls
,
with
the
commonest
of
accents
,
telephoned
to
announce
to
me
that
Letch
had
sired
their
unborn
children
!
Having
the
deepest
of
maternal
instincts
,
my
heart
fairly
bled
when
I
thought_of
the
darling
pink
and
white
``
bundles
from
heaven
''
I
would
have
proudly
given
my
husband
.
``
Ah
,
you
're
too
old
''
,
was
invariably
his
ungallant
and
untrue
retort
whenever
I
suggested
``
starting
a
family
''
.
Letch
had
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
he
did
not
care_for
the
company
of
my
own
precious
daughter
.
I
now
felt
it
wiser_to
keep
Baby-dear
in
school
and
-
during
the
summers
-
at
a
camp
run
by
the
Society_of_Friends
all
year
around
.
Her
presence
only
made
Letch
more
distant
and
irritable
and
,
in
the
hurry
of
buying
Chateau_Belletch
,
I
had
neglected
to
consider
a
room
for
Baby-dear
,
so
there
was
no
place
to
put
her
,
anyhow
.
(
I
sometimes
feel
that
God
,
in
His
infinite
wisdom
,
wants
us
to
have
these
inexplicable
little
lapses
of
memory
.
It
almost
always
works_out
for
the
best
.
)
Yet
I
adored
this
man
,
Letch_Feeley
,
why
,
I
cannot
say
.
With
faint
heart
and
a
brave
smile
,
I
endured
his
long
absences
from
Chateau_Belletch
,
his
coldness
,
his
indifference
,
his
slights
and
his
abuse
.
The
times
I
can
recall
when
I
was
publicly
humiliated
by
him
-
lovely
dinner_parties
in
our
Trianon
Suite
where
the
collation
was
postponed
and
postponed
and
postponed
,
only
to
be
served
dry
and
overcooked
at
a
table
where
the
host
's
chair
was
vacant
;
a
``
splash
party
''
at
the
new
pool
,
which
I
had
built
in
the
hope
of
keeping
Letch
away
from
public
beaches
,
when
Letch
and
a
certain
Aquacutie
stayed
underwater
together
for
the
better
part
of
an
hour
;
a
lovely
Epiphany
party
at
Errol_Flynn
's
,
on_which
sacred
occasion
Letch
stole_away
with
an
unknown
``
starlet
''
,
leaving
me
``
high
and
dry
''
to
get
home
as
best
I
could
.
These
are
but
a
sampling
of
the
insults
I
endured
.
As
Mrs._Letch_Feeley
,
was
it
any
wonder
that
I
,
once
the
social
arbiter
of
Filmdom
,
was
excluded
from
the
smart
entertainments
given
by
the
Astaires
,
the
Coopers
,
the
Gables
,
the
Colmans
,
the
Rathbones
,
the
Taylors
,
the
Thalbergs
and
such
devout
,
closely_knit
families
as
the
Barrymores
and
the
Crosbys
?
As
Letch
's
antisocial
conduct
increased
,
our
invitations
decreased
and
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
whenever
I
played
hostess
at
a
fashionable
``
screenland
''
gathering
.
Between
1935
and
1939
Letch
and
I
made
ten
films
together
,
each
less
successful
,
both
artistically
and
commercially
,
than
the
one
before
it
.
Our
last
joint_venture
,
Sainted_Lady
,
a
deeply
religious
film
based
on
the
life
of
Mother_Cabrini
,
and
timed
so_that
its
release
date
would
coincide
with
the
beatification
of
America
's
first
saint
in
November
,
1938
,
was
a
fiasco
from_start_to_finish
.
As
I
was
playing
Mother_Cabrini
,
the
picture
was
actually
``
all
mine
''
,
with
nearly
every
scene
built
around
me
.
But
in_order_to
keep
Letch
in_the_public_eye
and
out
of
trouble
,
I
wrote
in
a
part
especially
for
him
-
that
of
a
dashing
ruffian
who
``
sees
the
light
''
and
is
saved
by
the
inspiring
example
of
Mother_Cabrini
.
And
did
he
appreciate
my
efforts
on
his
behalf
?
Did
he
trouble
to
memorize
the
very
small
part
which
I
had
``
tailor-made
''
to
his
specifications
,
a
role
eventually
cut_down
to
three
short
speeches
?
Did
he
show
the
rest
of
the
cast
-
numbering
four
thousand
-
the
consideration
of
arriving_at
the
studio
punctually
-
or
even
at_all
?
He
did
not
!
The
``
shooting
''
went_on
for
eight
months
!
Most_of
our
working_days
were
spent
on
the
telephone
calling
``
bookies
''
,
illegal
gambling_dens
,
a
certain
``
residential
club
for
young_actresses
''
,
more_than
a_hundred
different
bars
or
the
steam_room
of
the
athletic
club
.
Whenever
he
deigned
to
appear
at
the
studio
he
was
``
hung_over
''
,
uncooperative
,
rude
and
insulting
.
He
made
many
tasteless
,
irreverent
and
unfunny
remarks
,
not_only
about
me
in
the
title_role
,
but
about
religion
in_general
.
By
the
time
the
film
was
released
we
were
three
million
dollars
over-spent
,
war
was
imminent
and
the
public
apparently
had
forgotten
all
about
Mother_Cabrini
.
Thanks
to
Letch_Feeley
and
the
terrible
strain
he
imposed
on
me
,
the
notices
were
few
and
unfavorable
.
Only
George_Santayana
seemed
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
film
when
he
wrote
:
``
Miss_Poitrine
has
perpetrated
the_most
eloquent
argument
for
the
Protestant
faith
yet
unleashed
by
Hollywood
''
.
But
it
was
small
consolation
.
In
a
rare
fit
of
anger
and
spite
,
I
``
farmed_out
''
my
own
husband
to
a
small
and
most
undistinguished
studio
to
make
one
picture
as
a
form
of
punishment
.
(
An
actor
must
have
discipline
.
)
The
film
was
called
The
Diet
of
Worms
,
which
I
felt
was
just
what
Letch
deserved
.
It
turned_out
to
be
a
life
of
Martin_Luther
,
of
all
things
!
It
was
a
disaster
!
In
clothes
,
Letch
simply
did
not
project
.
He
was
laughed_off
the
screen
.
At_the_same_time
,
however
,
I
availed
myself
of
the
services
of_that
great
English
actor
and
master
of
make-up
,
Sir_Gauntley_Pratt
,
to
do
a
``
quickie
''
called
The
Mystery
of
the
Mad_Marquess
,
in_which
I
played
a
young
American
girl
who
inherits
a
haunted
castle
on
the_English
moors
which
is
filled
with
secret
passages
and
sliding
panels
and
,
unbeknownst
to
anyone
,
is
still
occupied
by
an
eccentric
maniac
.
It
was
a
``
potboiler
''
made
on
a
``
shoestring
''
and
not
the
sort_of
film
I
like
,
as
all
I
had
to
do
was
look
blank
and
scream
a
great_deal
.
My
heart
was
not
in
it
,
but
,
oddly_enough
,
it
remains
the_most
financially
successful
picture
of
my
career
.
(
I
watched
it
on
television
late
one
night
last
week
and
it
``
stands_up
''
remarkably
well
,
even
twenty
years
later
.
)
Letch
had
returned
from
his
debacle
unrepentant
and
more
badly_behaved
than
before
.
I
really
loved
that
boy
,
and
,
in
a
feverish
attempt
to
preserve
our
marriage
and
to
try
to
revive
the
wonderful
,
wonderful
person
Letch
had
once
been
,
I
took
my
troubles
to
Momma
,
hoping
that
her
earthy
advice
would
help
me
.
``
If
I
could
only
think_of
something
at
the
studio
,
near
me
,
to
absorb
his
boundless
energy
''
,
I
said
.
``
What
is
Letch
interested
in
''
?
``
Bookies
,
booze
and
babes
''
,
Momma
said
bluntly
.
Her
reply
stung
me
,
but
this
was
too
important
to
let
my
hurt
make
any
difference
.
``
I
can
n't
turn
the
studio
into
a
gambling_hell
or
a
saloon
''
,
I
said
.
