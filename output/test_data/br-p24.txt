There
was
a
crowd
in
the
stands
for
a
change
and
the
sun
was
hot
.
The
new
Riverside
pitcher
turned_out
to
have
an
overhand
fast_ball
that
took
a
hop
.
For
a_few
innings
the
Anniston
team
could
n't
figure
him
out
.
Then
,
in
the
fifth
,
Anniston
's
kid
catcher
caught
onto
a
curve
and
smacked
the
ball
into
left
center_field
.
Eddie_Lee
,
Riverside
's
redheaded
playing
manager
,
ran
after
the
ball
but
it
rolled
past
him
.
Phil_Rossoff
cut
over
to
center
from
left_field
to
get
the
relay
.
Eddie
caught_up_with
the
ball
near
the
fence
and
threw
it
to
Phil
.
``
Third
!
Third_base
''
!
Eddie
shouted
.
Phil
spun_around
and
made
an
accurate
throw
into
Mike_Deegan
's
hands
on
third_base
.
Mike
caught
the
ball
just
as
the
catcher
slid
into
the
bag
.
But
the
Anniston
boy
had
begun
his
slide
too
late
.
He
came
into
the
bag
with
his
body
and
Mike_Deegan
brought
the
ball
down
full
in
his
face
.
``
You
bastard
''
!
the
Anniston
catcher
screamed
.
He
jumped_to_his_feet
and
started
to
throw
punches
.
Mike_Deegan
tossed
his
glove
away
and
began
to
swing
at
the
catcher
.
This
brought
in
everybody
from
both
sides
,
while
the
spectators
stood_up
and
added
to
the
uproar
.
The
fighters
were
separated
in
a_few
minutes
.
The
game
was
resumed
.
But
Mike_Deegan
was
boiling
mad
now
.
When
the
inning
was
over
he
cursed
the
Anniston
catcher
all_the_way
into
the
dugout
.
Phil_Rossoff
,
coming_in
from
left_field
,
stopped
at
the
water_fountain
for
a
drink
.
Mike_Deegan
was
standing
beside
it
,
facing
the
field
.
He
was
eyeing
the
Anniston
catcher
warming_up
his
pitcher
before
the
inning
began
.
``
Keep
your
eyes
open
,
sonny
''
!
Mike
yelled
to
the
catcher
.
``
You
're
in_for
trouble
''
.
The
Anniston
catcher
did
not
reply
with
words
.
He
simply
turned_to
Mike
and
smiled
.
This
so
infuriated
Deegan
that
he
spun_around
and
said
:
``
I
'll
get
that
little
bastard
.
So_help_me_God
,
I
'll
get
him
''
.
Phil_Rossoff
said
:
``
Why
do
n't
you
leave
him
alone
''
?
``
Mind
your
own
goddamn
business
''
,
Mike_Deegan
said
.
Phil
shrugged
.
He
stepped
into
the
dugout
,
wondering
why
Deegan
was
always
looking_for
trouble
.
Maybe
the
answer
was
in
his
eyes
.
When
Deegan
smiled
his
eyes
never
fit_in
with
his
lips
.
In
the
last
of
the
sixth
inning
Mike_Deegan
got_up
to
bat
and
hit
a
fast_ball
over
the
left_fielder
's
head
.
By
the
time
the
fielder
got
his
hands
on
the
ball
Deegan
was
rounding
third_base
and
heading
for
home
.
The
left_fielder
threw
and
it
was
a
good
one
.
But
Mike
had
no
chance
of
being
tagged
.
The
Anniston
catcher
was
straddling
home_plate
.
All
Deegan
had_to
do
was
slide
,
fall_away
,
but
instead
,
he
rammed
into
the
catcher
.
Both
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
.
Only
Mike
got
to
his
feet
.
He
went_back
to
touch
home_plate
,
turned
and
walked
to
the
dugout
without
looking_back
.
The
Anniston
players
and
their
manager
ran
out
on
the
field
.
They
poured
water
over
their
catcher
's
face
.
He
did
not
move
.
Then
the
manager
called_for
a
doctor
.
The
Riverside
physician
came
down
to
look
over
the
injured
ballplayer
.
Then
,
quickly
,
and
a_little
nervously
,
the
doctor
ordered
a_couple_of
ballplayers
to
carry
the
catcher
into
the
dressing_room
.
Mike_Deegan
was
sitting
on
the
bench
,
watching
.
When
the
ballplayers
started
to
carry
the
catcher
off
the
field
he
said
:
``
That
ought
to
teach
the
sonofabitch
''
.
Phil_Rossoff
,
seated
next
to
Deegan
,
got_up
and
moved
to
the
other
end
of
the
bench
.
The
Anniston
manager
was
coming
over
to
the
Riverside
dugout
.
He
was
followed
by
four
of
his
men
.
It
began
to
look
as
if
something
was
going_to
happen
.
Mike
sat
quietly
watching
the
manager
come
nearer
.
Eddie_Lee
moved
over
to
Mike_Deegan
's
side
.
No
one
said
a
word
.
The
Anniston
manager
came
right
up
to
the
dugout
in_front
of
Mike
.
His
face
was
flushed
.
``
Deegan
''
,
the
manager
said
,
his
voice
pitched
low
,
quivering
.
``
That
was
a
rotten
thing
to
do
''
.
``
For
God
's
sake
''
,
Mike
said
,
waving
the
manager
away
.
``
Stop
it
,
will
you
?
Tell
your
guys
not
to
block
the
plate
''
.
``
You
did
n't
have_to
ram
him
''
.
``
That
's
what
you
say
''
.
The
Anniston
manager
looked
at
Eddie_Lee
.
It
was
a
cold
and
calculated
look
.
He
turned
and
went_back
across
the
field
to
his
dugout
.
He
called_in
the
pitcher
who
had
been
pitching
,
and
a
big
,
heavy
,
powerfully
built
right
hander
moved
out
to
the
mound
for
Anniston
.
The
game
started
again
and
in
the
eighth
inning
Mike_Deegan
came
up
to
bat
.
Everyone
in
the
ball_park
seemed
to
be
standing
and
shouting
.
The
first
ball
the
hefty
pitcher
threw
came
in
for
Mike
's
head
.
Deegan
fell
into
the
dirt
,
the
ball
going
over
him
.
He
arose
slowly
and
brushed
himself
off
.
He
got
back
into
the
batter's_box
and
on
the
next
pitch
dropped
into
the
dirt
again
.
``
Hit
the
bum
''
!
somebody
yelled
from
the
Anniston
bench
.
In
the
Riverside
dugout
Frankie_Ricco
,
shortstop
,
whispered
into
Phil
's
ear
:
``
There
's
gonna
be
a
fight
''
.
``
Look
at
those
bastards
''
!
Charlie_Haydon
,
a
pitcher
,
said
.
``
They
're
looking_for
trouble
''
.
Mike
was
slow
getting
into
the
box
this
time
.
When
he
finally
did
he
had_to
duck
his
head
quickly
away
as
the
pitch
came_in
.
``
Listen
''
!
he
shouted
to
the
pitcher
.
``
One
more
and
I
'm
coming
out
there
''
!
``
I
'll
be
waiting
''
!
the
pitcher
yelled
back
.
Mike_Deegan
pounded
the
rubber
plate
with
the
end
of
his
bat
.
He
stood
flat-footed
in
the
box
,
but
not
very
close
to
the
plate
now
.
The
pitcher
wound_up
and
the
ball
came
in
straight
for
Mike
's
head
.
Deegan
dropped
,
got_up
,
turned
and
,
holding
the
bat
with
both
hands
up
against
his
chest
,
began
to
walk
slowly
out
to
the
mound
.
The
pitcher
tossed
his
glove
away
and
came
towards
Mike_Deegan
.
They
were
both
walking
towards
each
other
,
unhurried
.
Riverside
and
Anniston
players
rushed_out
on
the
field
.
In
the
next
moment
,
it
seemed
,
the
infield
was
crowded
with
spectators
,
ballplayers
,
cops
,
kids
and
a
dog
.
There
was
much
shouting
and
screaming
.
Fights
sprang_up
and
were
quickly
squelched
.
Mike
and
the
Anniston
pitcher
were
pulled_away
before
they
even
came
together
.
Phil_Rossoff
and
two
other
Riverside
players
did
not
go
out
on
the
field
when
the
fighting
started
.
After
the
game
,
Phil
was
taking_off
his
sweatshirt
in
the
dressing_room
when
Mike_Deegan
came_in
.
``
It
's
a
helluva
thing
''
,
Mike
said
,
looking
at
Phil
,
``
when
a
guy
's
own
team-mate
won
n't
come_out
and
help
him
in
a
fight
''
.
Phil
sighed
and
pulled
the
wet
sweatshirt
over
his
head
.
Frankie_Ricco
sat_down
on
the
bench
near
Phil
.
The
other
players
were
undressing
quietly
.
Eddie_Lee
had
not
come_in
yet
.
Mike
went
over
to
Phil
and
stood
over
him
.
``
Why
the
hell
did
n't
you
come_out
when
you
saw
them
gang_up
on
me
''
?
``
I
did
n't
think
it
was
necessary
''
.
``
Well
!
Now
that
's
just
fine
!
You
did
n't
think
it
was
necessary
''
.
Mike
placed
both
his
hands
on
his
hips
.
He
pushed
his
jaw
forward
.
``
Listen
,
wise_guy
,
if
you
think
I
'm
gonna
do
all
the
fighting
for
this
ball_club
you
're
crazy
''
.
Mike
had
a
good
two
inches
over
Phil
and
Phil
had_to
look
up
into
Mike
's
face
.
``
I
did
n't
ask
you
to
fight
for
the
ball_club
''
,
Phil
said
slowly
.
``
Nobody
else
did
,
either
''
.
``
You
trying
to
say
I
started
the
fight
''
?
``
I
'm
not
trying
to
say
anything
''
.
Phil
turned_away
and
opened
his
locker
,
and_then
he
heard
Mike_Deegan
say
:
``
You
're
yellow
,
Rossoff
''
!
and
Phil
banged
his
locker
door
shut
and
spun_around
.
But
before
anything
could
happen
Frankie_Ricco
was
between
them
and
Eddie_Lee
had
come
into
the
dressing_room
.
``
Phil
,
come
into
my
office
''
,
Eddie
said
.
Phil
followed
Eddie
into
the
office
and
shut
the
door
.
He
sat_down
before
Eddie
's
desk
.
``
I
'm
doing
you
a
favor
''
,
Eddie
said
quickly
.
``
You
get
your
unconditional
release
as
of
today
''
.
Phil
's
eyes
widened
just
a_trifle
.
``
The
best
thing
for
you
to
do
''
,
Eddie
said
,
``
is
go_home
.
You
do
n't
belong
in
professional
baseball
''
.
Phil
had_to
clear
his
throat
.
``
Is
this
because
of
what
happened
out
there
''
?
``
No
''
,
Eddie
said
.
``
But
it
does
confirm
what
I
've
suspected
all_along
''
.
Phil
stood_up
.
``
Listen
!
This
is
the
second
time
''
.
``
Sit_down
,
sit_down
''
,
Eddie
said
.
``
I
'm
not
saying
you
're
yellow
.
I
am
saying
you
're
not
a
professional
ballplayer
''
.
Eddie_Lee
leaned
forward
over
the
desk
.
``
Now
listen
to
me
,
Phil
.
I
'm
not
steering
you
wrong
.
You
have
n't
got
the
heart
for
baseball
''
.
Phil
shook
his
head
and
Eddie
frowned
.
Suddenly
his
voice
grew
hard
.
``
What
the
hell
do
you
think
baseball
is
?
You
're
not
in
the
big_leagues
,
but
if
you
can
n't
give_and_take
down
here
what
the
hell
do
you
think
it
'll
be
like
up
there
''
?
Phil
started
to
say
something
but
Eddie
cut
him
short
.
``
Now
do
n't
tell
me
what
a
good
ball_player
you
are
.
I
know
you
've
got
talent
.
But
what
you
have
n't
got
is
the
heart
to
back_up
that
talent
with
.
The
heart
,
Phil
.
You
just
have
n't
got
the
heart
for
pro-ball
,
and
that
's
it
''
.
Dazed
,
Phil
said
:
``
I
do
n't
get_it
.
My
batting_average
&
&
&
''
.
Eddie
stood_up
abruptly
,
then
sat_down
just
as
abruptly
.
``
What
difference
does
your
batting_average
make
?
Or
your
fielding_average
.
Or
even
the
way
you
run_bases
.
I
tell
you
when
it
's
necessary
to
hurt
in_order
to
win
-
you
won
n't
do
it
.
That
's
what
I
mean
by
no
heart
for
the
game
.
Baseball
's
no
cinch
.
Deegan
had
no
business
ramming
into
that
kid
out
there
.
He
did
it
because
he
knows
for
each
guy
he
puts
out_of_commission
that
's
one
less
who
might
take
his
job
away
later_on
.
What
the
hell
do
you
think
baseball
is
?
A
sport
?
It
's
a
way_of_life
,
goddamit
!
And
you
've
got
to
be
ready
to
cut_to_ribbons
anybody
who
want
to
take
your
way_of_life
away
from
you
''
!
He
's
wrong
!
Phil
thought
.
It
's
only
his
opinion
.
There
were
other
clubs
in
this
league
.
He
stood_up
slowly
.
He
was
a_little
pale
and
shaky
.
His
lips
felt
glued
together
.
``
I
think
you
're
wrong
,
Eddie
''
,
he
said
finally
.
Eddie
nodded
.
``
Okay
.
You
'll
get
your
pay
in
the
morning
''
.
Phil
turned
and
left
the
room
,
hearing
Eddie
say
:
``
Someday
you
'll
see
I
was
right
''
.
Phil
shut
the
door
behind
him
.
Outside
in
the
dressing_room
,
Frankie_Ricco
sat
on
the
bench
dressed
in
his
street_clothes
.
``
What
happened
''
?
Frankie
asked
.
Phil
said
:
``
I
got
my
release
''
.
``
You
crazy
''
?
Phil
shrugged
.
``
What
for
''
?
Phil
sighed
.
Frankie
shook
his
head
.
``
I
do
n't
get_it
''
.
``
I
do
n't
know
''
,
Phil
said
.
They
were
silent
for
a_few
moments
.
Then
Frankie
said
:
``
What
are
you
gonna
do
''
?
Phil
started
to
take
his
clothes
off
and
Frankie
sat_down
on
the
bench
again
.
Phil
took_off
one
shoe
and
stared
at
it
.
``
Do
n't
take
it
like
this
''
,
Frankie
said
.
``
Hell
,
plenty
of
guys
get
let_out
and
come_back
later
.
The
leagues
are
full
of
guys
like
that
''
.
Phil
was
very
quiet
.
``
What
are
you
gonna
do
,
Phil
''
?
Phil
did
not
answer
.
``
Why
not
try
another
club
''
?
Phil
looked
up
.
What
the
hell
right
did
Eddie
have
saying
a
thing
like
that
?
``
Springfield
's
in
tomorrow
''
,
Frankie
said
.
``
Talk
to
Whitey_Jackson
''
.
He
just
did
n't
know
what
he
was
talking_about
,
saying
a
thing
like
that
.
``
Will
you
do
it
,
Phil
''
?
``
Do
what
''
?
``
Ask
Whitey
for
a
job
''
.
Phil
nodded
.
``
Sure
''
,
he
said
.
``
Springfield
come_in
tomorrow
''
?
Frankie
nodded
.
``
I
'll
speak_to
Whitey
''
.
``
Atta_boy
''
.
``
I
'll
talk
to
him
,
all_right
''
.
``
Do
n't
worry
''
,
Frankie
said
.
``
You
'll
get
a
job
there
.
He
needs
outfielders
bad
''
.
``
I
'm
not
worried
about
it
''
,
Phil
said
.
``
That
's
the
way
to
talk
.
What
else
did
Eddie
have
to
say
''
?
``
Nothing
''
,
Phil
said
.
