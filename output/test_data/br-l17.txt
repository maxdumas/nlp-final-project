The
safe
at
Ingleside_District_Station
stands
next
to
the
gum
machine
in
a
narrow
passageway
that
leads
to
Captain_Harris
's
office
(
to
the
left
)
,
the
lieutenant
's
office
(
farther
along
and
to
the
left
)
and
the
janitor
's
supply_closet
(
straight
ahead
)
.
The
safe
is
a
repository
for
three
dead
flashlight_batteries
,
a_hundred
and
fifty
unused
left-hand
fingerprint
cards
,
a
stack
of
unsold
Policemen's_Ball
tickets
from
last
year
,
and
thirty-seven
cents
in
coins
and
stamps
.
Gun
set
the
captain
's
fifth
of
Hiram_Walker
inside
the
safe
before
he
reported
to
Lt._Killpath
,
though
he
knew
that
Killpath
's
ulcer
prevented
him
from
making
any
untoward
incursion
on
Herman_Wolff
's
gift
.
It
was
more
a
matter
of
tact
,
and
also
it
was
none
of
Killpath
's
goddam
business
.
He
walked
up_to
the
lieutenant
's
office
,
leaned
wearily
against
the
gun
rack
that
housed
four
rifles
and
a
gas_gun
nobody
remembered
having
used
and
a
submachine_gun
that
was
occasionally
tried_out
on
the
Academy_Range
.
He
stared
at
the
clerk
who
sat
at
a
scarred
and
ancient
fumed-oak
desk
stuffing
envelopes
.
``
Where
's
the
Lieut
''
?
The
clerk
wagged
his
head
toward
the
captain
's
office
.
Gun
went
to
the
connecting
door
,
which
was
open
,
and
stood
at
attention
while
Orville_Torrence_Killpath
,
in
full
uniform
,
finished
combing
his
hair
.
The
lieutenant
's
sparse
brown
hair
was
heavily
pomaded
,
and
as
Killpath
raked
the
comb
through
it
,
it
stuck
together
in
thatches
so
that
it
looked_like
umbrella
ribs
clinging
to
his
pink
skull
.
The
lieutenant
eyed
Gun
's
reflection
in
the
mirror
over
the
washbowl
and_then
glanced
back
at
his
own
face
,
moving
the
comb
methodically
around
his
head
.
Leave
me
alone
,
Gun
thought
.
Fight
with
Sam_Schaeffer
,
fight
with
the
whole
damned
Bureau
.
But
leave
me
alone
.
Because
I
'm
looking_for
the
son_of_a_bitch
that
killed
that
old_man
,
and
I
'm
going_to
get
him
.
If
you
just
leave
me
to
hell
alone
,
Lieutenant
.
Killpath
peered
through
half
closed
lids
at
his
reflection
,
thrust
up
his
chin
in
a
gesture
of
satisfaction
and
about-faced
.
Gun
waited
for
Killpath
to
sit_down
behind
the
desk
near
the
window
.
He
sat
stiff-backed
in
a
chair
that
did
not
swivel
,
though
it
was
obvious
to
Gun
that
Killpath
felt
his
position
as
acting
captain
plainly
merited
a
swivel_chair
.
The
desk
before
him
was
in
no
better
repair
than
the
rest
of
the
furniture
crowded
into
the
room
,
including
wooden
file_cabinets
with
some
of
their
pulls
yanked
off
and
a
wardrobe
stained
with
the
roof
seepage
of
countless
seasons
.
Killpath
pulled
one
thin
leg
up
,
clamping
his
arms
around
the
shinbone
to
press
his
knee
into
an
incredibly
scrawny
gut
.
It
was
the
posture
which
the
men
had
come
to
recognize
as
that
of
Killpath
defying
his
ulcer
.
He
put
his
chin
on
his
kneecap
,
stretching
his
neck
like
that
of
a
turkey
on
a
chopping_block
,
and
stared
wordlessly
at
his
sergeant
.
Gun
waited
.
The
7_:_45
bell
rang
and
he
could
hear
the
outside_doors
bang
shut
,
closing
in
the
assembled
day_watch
.
Finally
,
Orville
intoned
through
his
hawk_nose
,
``
We
can
n't
have
people
running
in
any
time
they
please
,
Sergeant
''
.
``
No
,
sir
''
.
``
Running
in
,
running
out
.
Ca
n't
have
it
.
Makes_for
confusion
and
congestion
''
.
He
rocked
back
in
the
chair
,
knee
locked
against
stomach
,
his
beady
eyes
fixed
on
Matson
.
He
was
silent
again
,
possibly
listening
to
the
sounds
in
the
squadroom
.
Roll
was
being
called
.
Gun
cleared
his
throat
.
Killpath
said
,
``
You
were
expected
to
report
to
my
office
twenty
minutes
ago
,
Sergeant
.
That
's
not
getting
all
the
juice
out
of
the
orange
,
now
is
it
''
?
``
No
,
sir
''
.
Then
Killpath
smiled
.
Gun
knew
that
nothing
but
aces
back_to_back
would
give
the
lieutenant
an
ulcer
and
a
smile
at_the_same_time
.
The
day-watch
platoon
commander
,
Lt._Rinker
,
was
calling_out
the
beat
assignments
,
but
Matson
could
n't
make
the
names
mean
anything
.
``
I
called
the
station
at
three
this
morning
''
,
Killpath
's
nasal
voice
pronounced
.
``
Do
you
have
any
idea
who
might
have
been
in_charge
at
the
time
''
?
``
Sergeant_Vaughn
,
sir
''
.
``
Now
,
now
,
you
're
just
guessing
,
Sergeant
''
.
He
smiled
thinly
,
savoring
his
joke
.
``
What
if
I
said
nobody
was
here
but
a_couple_of
patrolmen
''
?
``
Sir
,
Vaughn
knows
better
than
to
leave
the
station
without
a
relief
.
He
must
have
''
-
``
He
let
a
patrolman
take_over
the
duties
of
the
station_keeper
.
Now
that
's
not
regulation
,
is
it
''
?
``
No
,
sir
''
.
``
But
you
did
n't
know
a
thing
about
it
,
did
you
''
?
Killpath
leaned
forward
;
his
foot
slipped
off
the
chair
and
he
put
it
back
again
,
frowning
now
.
``
That
's
not
taking
one
's
command
with
a
responsible
attitude
,
Matson
''
.
Gun
told
himself
that
the
old
bastard
was
a
fool
.
But
stupidity
was
no
consolation
when
it
had
rank
.
``
I
was
out
in
the
district
,
sir
''
.
``
Oh
,
yes
.
So
I
have
heard
''
.
He
stretched
a
pale
hand
out
to
the
scattered
papers
on
his
desk
.
``
I
might
point_out
that
your
inability
to
report
to
my
office
this
morning
when
you
were
instructed
to
do
so
has
not
,
ah
,
limited
my
knowledge
of
your
activities
as
you
may
have
hoped
''
.
He
took_up
a
white
sheet_of_paper
,
dark
with
single-spaced
data
.
A
car
pulled
into
the
driveway
outside
the
window
.
Gun
knew
it
was
Car_12
,
the
wagon
,
returned
from
delivering
Ingleside
's
drunk-and-disorderlies
to
the
City_Jail
.
But
for
some
fool
reason
he
could
n't
remember
which
men
he
'd
put
on
the
transfer
detail
.
He
stared
at
the
report
in
Killpath
's
hand
,
sure
it
was
written
by
Accacia
-
just
as
sure
as
if
he
'd
submitted
it
in
his
scrawled
longhand
.
He
sucked_in
his
breath
and
kept
quiet
while
Killpath
laid
down
the
sheet
again
,
wound
the
gold
wire
stems
of
his
glasses
around
his
ears
and_then
,
eying
the
report
as
it
lay
before
him
on
the
desk
,
intoned
,
``

he
leaned_back
and
peeled_off
his

with

promptly
when

What

you
to

to_that
,
Sergeant
''
?
Killpath
sailed
the
paper
across
the
desk
,
but
Matson
did
n't
pick
it
up
or
even
glance
at
it
.
``
Well
''
?
``
I
did
n't
think
Accacia
knew
so
many
big
words

.
Killpath
licked
his
lips
.
``
Patrolman_Accacia

and

officer

I
do
n't
think

mitigates

,
Matson
''
.
``
Negligence
,
hell
''
!
Gun
held
his
breath
a
moment
,
pushing
the
volume
and
pitch
of
his
voice
down
under
the
trapdoor
in
his
throat
.
``
Sir
.
I
would
have
been
negligent
and
a
goddam
lousy
cop
to_boot
,
if
I
'd
sat
around
this
station
all
night
when
somebody
got_away
with
murder
in
my
district

It
's
too_bad
I
did
n't
call

and
it

let
Schaeffer
use
Accacia
when
he
could
have
had
a
boy
who
'd
be
glad
to
learn
something
of
Homicide
procedure
.
But
I
'm
not
one
damned
bit
sorry
I
went_out
to
question
the
people
I
know
in
the
places
they
hang_around
,
and
''
-
``
Let
's
not
push
our
patience
beyond
the
danger_line
,
Sergeant
''
,
Killpath
nasaled
.
``
I
should
n't
like
to
have
to
write
you
up
for
insubordination
as_well
as
dereliction
of
duty
''
.
Gun
stiffened
,
his
hands
balling
into
fists
at
his
sides
.
He
clamped
his
jaws
to
keep
the
fury
from
spilling_out
.
An
argument
with
Orville_Torrence_Killpath
was
as
frustrating
and
as
futile
as
a
cap
pistol
on
a
firing_range
.
Killpath
leaned
forward
again
,
rocked
comfortably
with
his
arms
still
wrapped
around
one
knee
.
``
Let
's
just
remember
,
Sergeant
,
that
we
must
all
carry_our_own_umbrella
.
A
district
station
can
n't
run
smoothly
,
unless
''
-
He
interrupted
himself
,
looking
around
Gun
at
the
doorway
.
``
Morning
,
Lieutenant_Rinker
''
.
``
Sorry
,
Orville
.
I
thought
you
had
n't
come_in
yet
''
.
``
I
've
been
here
for
some
time
''
.
He
stood_up
,
cocked
his
head
and
eyed
Gun
coldly
.
``
The
sergeant
is
just
leaving
''
.
It
had
come
as
no
great
surprise
to
Matson
that
the
hot
water
in
the
showers
did
n't
work
,
that
Loren_Severe
had
thrown_up
all_over
the
stairs
,
or
that
some
thieving
bastard
of
a
cop
had
walked_off
with
his
cigarettes
.
It
was
the
best
he
could
hope
for
on
a
watch
that
had
ended
with
a
session
in
Killpath
's
office
.
Now
,
as
he
passed
the
open
counter
that
divided
the
assembly
room
from
the
business
office
,
he
nodded
and
said
good_night
to
the
station_keeper
and
his
clerks
,
not
stopping
to
hear
the
day-watch
playback
of
his
chewing_out
.
Not
that
he
gave
a
damn
what
the
grapevine
sent_out
about
Killpath
's
little
speech
on
the
comportment
of
platoon
commanders
.
He
just
did
n't
want
to
talk_about
it
.
If
the
acting
captain
wanted
his
acting
lieutenant
to
sit
on
his
ass
around
the
station
all
night
,
Killpath
would
just
have
to
go_out
and
drag
Gun
back
by
the
heels
once
an
hour
;
because
he
'd
be
damned
if
he
was
going_to
be
a
mid-watch
pencil-pusher
just
to
please
his
ulcerated
pro-tem
captain
.
At
the
doorway
he
squinted
up
at
the
gray
morning
overcast
and
patted
his
jacket
pockets
for
the
cigarettes
,
remembering
then
that
he
'd
left
them
at
the
Doughnuttery
.
He
could
pick_up
another
pack
on
his
way
home
,
if
he
were
going_home
.
But
even
before
he
started
across
the
oiled
road
to
his
Plymouth
,
parked
in
the
lot
under
the
cypress_trees
across
from
the
station
,
he
knew
that
he
was
n't
going_home
.
Not_yet
.
It
was
nine
o_'_clock
in
the
morning
:
the
hour
which
,
like
a
spade
turning
clods
of
earth
,
exposed
to
the
day
a
myriad
of
busy
creatures
that
had
lain_dormant
in
the
quiet
night
.
Mission_Street
at
this
hour
was
populated
by
a
whole
community
that
Gun
could
not
have
seen
on
his
tour
of
duty
-
the
neighborhood
that
had
known
Urbano_Quintana
by
day
.
Sol_Phillips
had
purchased
the
Alliance_Furniture_Mart
seventeen
years
ago
.
It
was
professedly
worth
three
thousand
dollars
in
stock
and
good_will
,
and
the
name
was
written
in
gold
in
foot
high
letters
across
each
of
the
two
display_windows
.
On
the
right
window
,
at
eye
level
,
in
smaller
print
but
also
in
gold
,
was
Gonzalez
,
Prop.
,
and
under_that
,
Se_Habla_Espanol
.
Mr._Phillips
took
a
razor
to
Gonzalez
,
Prop.
,
but
left
the
promise
that
Spanish
would
be
understood
because
he
thought
it
meant
that
Spanish
clientele
would
be
welcome
.
Language
was
no
problem
anyway
;
Mr._Phillips
had
only
to
signal
from
his
doorway
to
summon
aid
from
the
ubiquitous
bilingual
children
who
played
on
the
sidewalks
of
Mission_Street
.
Aside
from
the
fact
that
business
was
slow
this
time_of_year
and
his
one
salesgirl
was
not
the
most
enterprising
,
Mr._Phillips
had
no
worries
at_all
,
and
he
said
as
much
to
Gun_Matson
,
who
sat
across
from
him
in
civilian
clothes
,
on
a
Jiffy-Couch-a-Bed
,
mauve
velour
,
$
79.89
nothing
down
special
!
``
She
's
honest_as_the_day
''
,
Mr._Phillips
said
,
and
added
,
``
Mr._Gunnar
,
I
can
say
this
to
you
:
Beebe
is
a_little
too
honest
.
You
can
n't
tell
a
customer
how
much
it
's
going_to
cost
him
to
refinance
his
payments
before
he
even
signs
for
a
loan
on
the
money
down
!
A
time_plan
is
a
mere
convenience
,
you
understand
,
and
when
''
-
He
interrupted
himself
,
smiling
.
``
I
put
her
in
lamps
.
That
way
I
do
n't
lose
so
much
''
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
just
hire
somebody
else
''
?
