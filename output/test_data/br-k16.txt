The
red
glow
from
the
cove
had
died_out
of
the
sky
.
The
two
in
the
bed
knew
each
other
as
old
people
know
the
partners
with
whom
they
have
shared
the
same
bed
for
many
years
,
and
they
needed
to
say
no_more
.
The
things
left
unsaid
they
both
felt
deeply
,
and
with
a
sigh
they
fell_back
on
the
well
stuffed
pillows
.
Anita
put_out
the
remaining
candles
with
a
long
snuffer
,
and
in
the
smell
of
scented
candlewick
,
the
comforting
awareness
of
each
other
's
bodies
,
the
retained
pattern
of
dancers
and
guests
remembered
,
their
minds
grew
numb
and
then
empty_of
images
.
They
slept
-
Mynheer
with
a
marvelously
high-pitched
snoring
,
the
damn
seahorse
ivory
teeth
watching
him
from
a
bedside
table
.
In
the
ballroom
below
,
the
dark
had
given_way
to
moonlight
coming_in
through
the
bank
of
French_windows
.
It
was
a
delayed
moon
,
but
now
the
sky
had
cleared
of
scudding
black
and
the
stars
sugared
the
silver-gray
sky
.
Martha_Schuyler
,
old
,
slow
,
careful
of
foot
,
came_down
the
great
staircase
,
dressed
in
her
best
lace-drawn
black
silk
,
her
jeweled
shoe
buckles
held
forward
.
``
Well
,
I'm
here
at_last
''
,
she
said
,
addressing
the
old
portraits
on
the
walls
.
``
I
do
n't
hear
the
music
.
I
am
getting
deaf
,
I
must
admit
it
''
.
She
came
to
the
ballroom
and
stood
on
the
two
carpeted
steps
that
led
down
to
it
.
``
Where
is
everyone
?
I_say
,
where
is
everyone
?
Peter
,
you
lummox
,
you
've
forgot
to
order
the
musicians
''
.
She
stood
there
,
a
large
old_woman
,
smiling
at
the
things
she
would
say
to
him
in
the
morning
,
this
big
foolish
baby
of
a
son
.
There
were
times
now
,
like
this
,
when
she
lost_control
of
the
time
count
and
moved
freely
back_and_forth
into
three
generations
.
Was
it
a
birthday
ball
?
When
Peter
had
reached
his
majority
at
eighteen
?
Or
was
it
her
own
first
ball
as
mistress
of
this
big
house
,
a
Van_Rensselaer
bride
from
way
upstate
near
Albany
,
from
Rensselaerwyck
.
And
this
handsome
booby
,
staring
and
sweating
,
was
he
her
bridegroom
?
Martha
picked_up
the
hem
of
her
gown
and
with
eyes
closed
she
slowly
began
to
dance
a
stately
minuet
around
the
ballroom
.
David_Cortlandt
was
tired
beyond
almost
the
limits
of
his
flesh
.
He
had
ridden
hard
from
Boston
,
and
he
was
not
used_to
horseback
.
Now
,
driving
the
horse
and
sulky
borrowed
from
Mynheer_Schuyler
,
he
felt
as
if
every
bone
was
topped
by
burning
oil
and
that
every
muscle
was
ready
to
dissolve
into
jelly
and
leave
his
big
body
helpless
and
unable
to
move
.
The
road
leading
south
along
the
river
was
shaded
with
old
trees
,
and
in
the
moonlight
the
silvery
landscape
was
like
a
setting
for
trolls
and
wood
gods
rather_than
the
Hudson_River
Valley
of
his
boyhood
memories
.
He
slapped
the
reins
on
the
back
of
the
powerful
gray
horse
and
held_on
as
the
sulky
's
wheels
hit
a
pothole
and
came_out
with
a
jolt
and
went_on
.
He
would
cross
to
Manhattan
,
to
Harlem_Heights
,
before
morning
.
There
a
certain
farmhouse
was
a
station
for
the
Sons_of_Liberty
.
He
would
send_on
by
trusted
messenger
the
dispatches
with
their
electrifying
news
.
And
he
would
sleep
,
sleep
,
and
never
think_of
roads
and
horses
'
sore
haunches
,
of
colonial
wars
.
Strange
how
everything
here
fitted
back
into
his
life
,
even
if
he
had
been
away
so
long
.
Mynheer
,
Sir_Francis
,
the
valley
society
,
the
very
smell
of
the
river
on
his
right
purling
along
to
the
bay
past
fish
weirs
and
rocks
,
and
ahead
the
sleepy
ribbon
of
moon
drenched
road
.
A
mist
was
walking
on
the
water
,
white
as
cotton
,
but
with
a
blending
and
merging
grace
.
Ahead
there
was
a
stirring
of
sudden
movement
at
a
crossroads
.
David
reached
for
the
pair
of
pistols
in
the
saddlebags
at
his
feet
.
He
pulled_out
one
of
them
and
cocked
it
.
A
strange
wood
creature
came
floating
up
from
a
patch
of
berry
bushes
.
It
was
a
grotesque
hen
,
five
or
six
feet
tall
.
It
had
the
features
of
a
man
bewhiskered
by
clumps
of
loose
feathers
.
It
ran
,
this
apocalyptic
beast
,
on
two
thin
legs
,
and
its
wings
-
were
they
feathered
arms
?
-
flapped
as
it
ran
.
Its
groin
was
bloody
.
Black
strips
of
skin
hung
from
it
.
The
horse
shied
at
the
dreadful
thing
and
flared
its
nostrils
.
David
took_a_firm_hand
with
it
.
The
creature
in
feathers
looked_around
and
David
saw
the
mad
eyes
,
glazed
with
an
insane
fear
.
The
ungainly
bird
thing
ran_away
,
and
to
David
its
croaking
sounded
like
the
crowing
of
a
tormented
rooster
.
Then
it
was
gone
.
He
drove
on
,
wary
and
shaken
.
The
Sons
were
out
tonight
.
New_York
lay
bleaching
in
the
summer
sun
,
and
the
morning
fish_hawk
,
flying
in
the
heated
air
,
saw
below
him
the
long
triangular
wedge
of
Manhattan_Island
.
It
was
thickly_settled
by
fifteen
thousand
citizens
and
laid_out
into
pig
infested
streets
,
mostly
around
the
Battery
,
going
bravely
north
to
Wall_Street
,
but
giving_up
and
becoming
fields
and
farms
in
the
region
of
Harlem_Heights
.
From
there
it
looked_across
at
Westchester_County
and
the
Hudson_River
where
the
manor_houses
,
estates
,
and
big
farms
of
the
original
(
non
Indian
)
landowners
began
.
On
the
east_side
of
the
island
of
Manhattan
the
indifferent
hawk
knew
the
East_River
that
connected
New_York_Bay
with
Long_Island_Sound
.
On
the
western
tip
of
Long_Island
protruded
Brooklyn_Heights
.
It
commanded
a
view
over
Manhattan
and
the
harbor
.
A
fringe
of
housing
and
gardens
bearded
the
top
of
the
heights
,
and
behind
it
were
sandy
roads
leading
past
farms
and
hayfields
.
Husbandry
was
bounded
by
snake-rail_fences
,
and
there
were
grazing
cattle
.
On
the
shores
north
and
south
,
the
fishers
and
mooncursers
-
smugglers
-
lived
along
the
churning
Great_South_Bay
and
the
narrow
barrier
of
sand
,
Fire_Island
.
The
morning
hawk
,
hungry
for
any
eatable
,
killable
,
digestible
item
,
kept
his
eyes
on
the
ring
of
anchored
ships
that
lay
off
the
shores
in
the
bay
,
sheltered
by
the
Jersey
inlets
.
They
often
threw
tidbits
overboard
.
The
larger
ships
were
near
Paulus_Hook
,
already
being
called
,
by
a_few
,
Jersey_City
.
These
were
the
ships
of
His
Majesty
's
Navy
,
herding
the
hulks
of
the
East_Indies
merchants
and
the
yachts
and
ketches
of
the
loyalists
.
The
news
of
battle
on
Breed_'s_Hill
had
already
seeped
through
,
and
New_York
itself
was
now
left
in
the
hands
of
the
local
Provincial_Congress
.
The
fish_hawk
,
his
wings
not
moving
,
circled
and
glided
lower
.
The
gilt
sterns
of
the
men-of-war
becoming
clearer
to
him
,
the
sides
of
the
wooden
sea
walls
alternately
painted
yellow
and
black
,
the
bronze
cannon
at
the
ports
.
The
captain
's
gig
of
H.M.S._Mercury
was
being
rowed
to
H.M.S._Neptune
.
On
shore
``
the
freed
slaves
to
despotism
''
-
the
town
dwellers
-
watched
the
ships
and
waited
.
The
chevaux_de_frise
,
those
sharp
stakes
and
barriers
around
the
fort
at
the
Battery
,
pointed
to
a
conflict
between
the
town
and
sea_power
rolling
in
glassy
swells
as
the
tide
came_in
.
Across
the
bay
the
Palisades
were
heavy
in
green
timber
;
their
rock
paths
led
down
to
the
Hudson
.
Below
in
the
open
bay
facing
Manhattan
was
Staten_Island
,
gritty
with
clam_shells
and
mud_flats
behind
which
nested
farms
,
cattle
barns
,
and
berry
thickets
.
Along
Wappinger_Creek
in
Dutchess_County
,
past
the
white
church
at
Fishkill
,
past
Verplanck_'s_Point
on
the
east
bank
of
the
Hudson
,
to
the
white
salt
crusted
roads
of
the
Long_Island_Rockaways
there
was
a
watching
and
an
activity
of
preparing_for
something
explosive
to
happen
.
Today
,
tomorrow
,
six
months
,
even
perhaps
a
year
.
The
fish_hawk
flew_on
and
was
lost
from
sight
.
The
British
ships
rolled
at
anchor
,
sent_out
picket_boats
and
waited
for
orders
from
London
.
Waited
for
more
ships
,
more
lobster-backed
infantry
,
and
asked
what
was
to
be
done
with
a
war
of
rebellion
?
David_Cortlandt
,
having
slept
away
a
day
and
a
night
,
came
awake
in
a
plank
farmhouse
on
the
Harlem_River
near
Spuyten_Duyvil
.
He
looked_out
through
windowpanes
turned
a
faint
violet
by
sun
and
weather
,
looked_out
at
King_'s_Bridge
toward
Westchester
.
The
road
seemed
animated
with
a
few
more
wagons
than
usual
;
a
carriage
raising_up
the
choking
June
dust
,
and
beyond
,
in
a
meadow
,
a
local
militia
company
drilling
with
muskets
,
Kentuck
'
rifles
,
every
kind
of
horse
pistol
,
old
sword
,
or
cutlass
.
The
wraith-like
events
of
the
last
few
days
flooded
David
's
mind
and
he
rubbed
his
unshaved
chin
and
felt
again
the
ache
in
his
kidneys
caused
by
his
saddle
odyssey
from
Boston
.
Pensive
,
introspective
,
he
ached
.
He
had
sent
the
dispatches
downtown
to
the
proper
people
and
had
slept
.
Now
there
was
more
to
do
.
Orders
not
written_down
had_to
be
transmitted
to
the
local
provincial
government
.
He
scratched
his
mosquito
plagued
neck
.
From
the
saddlebags
,
hung_on
a
Hitchcock_chair
,
David
took_out
a
good
English
razor
,
a
present
from
John_Hunter
.
He
found
tepid
water
in
a
pitcher
and
a
last
bit
of
soap
,
and
he
lathered
his
face
and
stood
stropping
the
razor
on
his
broad
leather
belt
,
its
buckle
held
firm
by
a
knob
of
the
bedpost
.
He
hoped
he
was
free_of
self-deception
.
Here
he
was
,
suddenly
caught_up
in
the
delirium
of
a
war
,
in
the
spite
and
calumny
of
Whigs
and
Tories
.
There
would
be
great
need
soon
for
his
skill
as
surgeon
,
but
somehow
he
had
not
planned
to
use
his
knowledge
merely
for
war
.
David_Cortlandt
had
certain
psychic
intuitions
that
this
rebellion
was
not
wholly
what
it
appeared
on
the
surface
.
He
knew
that
many
were
using
it
for
their
own
ends
.
But
it
did
not
matter
.
He
stropped
the
razor
slowly
;
what
mattered
was
that
a
new
concept
of
Americans
was
being
born
.
That
some
men
did
not
want
it
he
could
understand
.
The
moral
aridity
of
merchants
made
them
loyal
usually
to
their
ledgers
.
Yet
some
,
like
Morris_Manderscheid
,
would
bankrupt
themselves
for
the
new
ideas
.
Unique
circumstances
would
test
us
all
,
he
decided
.
Injury
and
ingratitude
would
occur
.
No_doubt
John_Hancock
would
do
well
now
;
war
was
a
smugglers
'
heaven
.
And
what
of
that
poor
tarred_and_feathered
wretch
he
had
seen
on
the
road
driving
down
from
Schuyler
's
?
Things
like
that
would
increase
rather_than
be
done_away_with
.
One
had_to
believe_in
final
events
or
one
was
stranded
in
the
abyss
of
nothing
.
He
saw
with
John_Hunter
now
that
the
perfectability
of
man
was
a
dream
.
Life
was
a
short
play
of
tenebrous
shadows
.
David
began
to
shave
with
great
sweeping
strokes
.
Time
plays
an
essential
part
in
our
mortality
,
and
suddenly
for
no
reason
he
could
imagine
(
or
admit
)
the
image
of
Peg
laughing
filled
his
mind
-
so
desirable
,
so
lusty
,
so
full
of
nuances
of
pleasure
and
joy
.
He
drove
sensual
patterns
off
,
carefully
shaving
his
long
upper
lip
.
It
is
harder
,
he
muttered
,
to
meditate
on
man
(
or
woman
)
than
on
God
.
David
finished
shaving
,
washed
his
face
clean
of
lather
,
and
combed
and
retied
his
hair
.
He
was
proud
that
he
had
never
worn
a
wig
.
More_and_more
of
the
colonials
were
wearing
their
own
hair
and
not
using
powder
.
He
felt
cheerful
again
,
refreshed
;
presentable
in
his
wide-cut
brown
suit
,
the
well-made
riding_boots
.
It
is
so
easy
to
falsify
sentiment
.
In
the
meadow
below
,
militia
officers
shouted
at
their
men
and
on
King_'s_Bridge
two
boys
sat
fishing
.
The
future
would
happen
;
he
did
not
have_to
hurry
it
by
thinking
too_much
.
A
man
could
be
tossed
outside
the
dimension
of
time
by
a
stray
bullet
these
days
.
He
began
to
pack
the
saddlebags
.
And
all
this
too
shall
pass_away
:
it
came
to
him
out
of
some
dim
corner
of
memory
from
a
church_service
when
he
was
a
boy
-
yes
,
in
a
white
church
with
a
thin
spur
steeple
in
the
patriarchal
Hudson_Valley
,
where
a
feeling
of
plenitude
was
normal
in
those
English
Dutch
manors
with
their
well-fed
squires
.
