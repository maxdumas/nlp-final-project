Where
their
sharp
edges
seemed
restless
as
sea
waves
thrusting
themselves
upward
in
angry
motion
,
Papa-san
sat
glacier
like
,
his
smooth
solidity
,
his
very
immobility
defying
all
the
turmoil
about
him
.
``
Our
objective
''
,
the
colonel
had
said
that
day
of
the
briefing
,
``
is
Papa-san
''
.
There
the
objective
sat
,
brooding
over
all
.
Gouge
,
burn
,
blast
,
insult
it
as
they
would
,
could
anyone
really
take
Papa-san
?
Between
the
ponderous
hulk
and
himself
,
in
the
valley
over
which
Papa-san
reigned
,
men
had
hidden
high_explosives
,
booby_traps
,
and
mines
.
The
raped
valley
was
a
pregnant
womb
awaiting
abortion
.
On
the
forward
slope
in_front_of
his
own
post
stretched
two
rows
of
barbed_wire
.
At
the
slope
's
base
coils
of
concertina
stretched
out_of
eye
range
like
a
wild
tangle
of
children
's
hoops
,
stopped
simultaneously
,
weirdly
poised
as
if
awaiting
the
magic
of
the
child
's
touch
to
start
them
all
rolling
again
.
Closer
still
,
regular
barricades
of
barbed_wire
hung
on
timber
supports
.
Was
it
all
vain
labor
?
Who
would
clean_up
the
mess
when
the
war
was
over
?
Smiling
at
his
quixotic
thoughts
,
Warren
turned_back
from
the
opening
and
lit
a
cigarette
before
sitting_down
.
Tonight
a
group
of
men
,
tomorrow
night
he
himself
,
would
go_out
there
somewhere
and
wait
.
If
he
were
to
go
with
White
,
he
would
be
out
there
two
days
,
not
just
listening
in
the
dark
at
some
point
between
here
and
Papa-san
,
but
moving
ever
deeper
into
enemy
land
-
behind
Papa-san
itself
.
Was
this
what
he
had
expected
?
He
had
n't
realized
that
there
would
be
so
much
time
to
think
,
so
many
lulls
.
Somehow
he
had
forgotten
what
he
must
have
been
told
,
that
combat
was
an
intermittent
activity
.
Now
he
knew
that
the
moment
illuminated
by
the
vision
on
the
train
would
have_to
be
approached
.
It
could
take_place
tomorrow
night
,
or
it
might
occur
months
from
now
.
There
was
just
too
much
time
.
Time
to
become
afraid
.
White
's
suggestion
flattered
,
but
he
did
not
like
the
identity
.
He
did
not
spill_over
with
hatred
for
the
enemy
.
He
had
n't
even
seen
him
yet
.
Pressing
his
cigarette
out
in
the
earth
,
Warren
walked
to
the
slit
and
scanned
the
jagged
hills
.
He
saw
no
life
,
but
still
stood
there
for
a
time
peering
at
the
unlovely
hills
,
his
gaze
continually
returning
to
Papa-san
.
He
had
come
here
in_order
to
test
himself
.
While
most
of
his
beliefs
were
still
unsettled
,
he
knew
that
he
did
not
believe_in
killing
.
Yet
,
he
was
here
.
He
had
come
because
he
could
not
live_out
his
life
feeling
that
he
had
been
a
coward
.
There
were
ten
men
on
the
patrol
which
Sergeant_Prevot
led
out
that
next
night
.
The
beaming
rok
was
carrying
a
thirty
caliber
machine_gun
;
another
man
lugged
the
tripod
and
a
box
of
ammunition
.
Warren
and
White
each
carried
,
in_addition
to
their
own
weapons
and
ammo
,
a
box
of
ammo
for
the
ROK
's
machine_gun
.
Others
carried
extra
clips
for
the
Browning_Automatic_Rifle
,
which
was
in
the
hands
of
a
little
Mexican
named
Martinez
.
Prevot
had
briefed
the
two
new
men
that
afternoon
.
``
We
just
sit
quiet
and
wait
''
,
Prevot
had
said
.
``
Be
sure
the
man
nearest
you
is
awake
.
If
Joe
does
n't
show_up
,
we
'll
all
be
back
here
at
0600
hours
.
Otherwise
,
we
hold
a
reception
.
Then
we
pull_out
under
our
mortar
and
artillery
cover
,
but
nobody
pulls_out
until
I
say
so
.
Remember
what
I
said
about
going_out
to
get
anybody
left
behind
?
That
still
holds
.
We
bring_back
all
dead
and
wounded
''
.
At
2130
hours
they
had
passed_through
the
barbed_wire
at
the
point
of
departure
.
Then
began
the
journey
through
their
own
mine_fields
.
Mines
.
Ours
were
kinder
than
theirs
,
some
said
.
They
set
bouncing_betties
to
jump
and
explode
at
testicle
level
while
we
more
mercifully
had
them
go_off
at
the
head
.
Mines
.
Big
ones
and
little
.
The
crude
wooden
boxes
of
the
enemy
,
our
nicely
turned
gray
metal
disks
.
But
theirs
defied
the
detectors
.
Mines
.
A
foot
misplaced
,
a
leg
missing
.
Mines
.
All
sizes
:
big
ones
,
some
wired
to
set_off
a
whole
field
,
little
ones
,
hand_grenade
size
.
Booby_traps
to
fill
the
head
with
chunks
of
metal
.
Warren
tried
to
shake_off
the
jumble
of
his
fears
by
looking_at
the
sky
.
It
was
dark
.
Prevot
had
said
that
the
searchlights
would
be
bounced
off
the
clouds
at
2230
hours
,
``
which
gives
us
time
to
get
settled
in
position
''
.
Because
they
were
new
men
and
to
be
sure
that
they
did
n't
get
lost
,
Prevot
had
placed
Warren
and
White
in
the
center
of
the
patrol
as
it
filed_out
.
His
eyes
now
fixed
on
White
's
solid
figure
,
Warren
could
hear
behind
him
the
tread
of
another
.
He
could
also
hear
the
stream
which
he
had
seen
from
his
position
.
They
were
going
to
follow
it
for
part
of
their
journey
.
``
It
's
safe
''
,
Prevot
had
said
,
``
and
it
provides
cover
for
our
noise
''
.
Soon
they
were
picking
their
way
along
the
edge
of
the
stream
which
glowed
in
the
night
.
On
their
right
rose
the
embankment
covered
with
brush
and
trees
.
If
a
branch
extended
out
too
far
,
each
man
held
it
back
for
the
next
,
and
if
they
met
a
low
overhang
,
each
warned
the
other
.
Thus
,
stealthily
they
advanced
upstream
;
then
they
turned
to
the
right
,
climbed
the
embankment
,
and
walked
into
the
valley
again
.
There
was
no
cover
here
,
only
grass
sighing
against
pant-legs
.
And
with
each
sigh
,
like
a
whip
in
the
hand
of
an
expert
,
the
grass
stripped
something
from
Warren
.
The
gentle
whir
of
each
footstep
left
him
more
naked
than
before
,
until
he
felt
his
unprotected
flesh
tremble
,
chilled
by
each
new
sound
.
The
shapes
of
the
men
ahead
of
him
lacked
solidity
,
as
if
the
whip
had
stripped
them
of
their
very
flesh
.
The
dark
forms
moved
like
mourners
on
some
nocturnal
pilgrimage
,
their
dirge
unsung
for
want
of
vocal_chords
.
The
warped
,
broken
trees
in
the
valley
assumed
wraith-like
shapes
.
Clumps
of
brush
that
they
passed
were
so
many
enchained
demons
straining
in
anger
to
tear
and
gnaw
on
his
bones
.
Looming
over
all
,
Papa-san
leered
down
at
him
,
threatening
a_hundred
hidden
malevolencies
.
Off
in
the
distance
a
searchlight
flashed
on
,
its
beam
slashing
the
sky
.
The
sharp
ray
was
absorbed
by
a
cloud
,
then
reflected
to
the
earth
in
a
softer
,
diffused
radiance
.
Somewhere
over
there
another
patrol
had
need
of
light
.
Warren
thought_of
all
the
men
out
that
night
who
,
like
himself
,
had
left
their
protective
ridge
and
-
fear
working
at
their
guts
-
picked
their
way
into
the
area
beyond
.
From
the
east
to
the
west
coast
of
the
Korean_peninsula
was
a
strip
of
land
in
which
fear
filled
men
were
at
that
same
moment
furtively
crawling
through
the
night
,
sitting
in
sweaty
anticipation
of
any
movement
or
sound
,
or
shouting
amidst
confused
rifle
flashes
and
muzzle
blasts
.
White
's
arm
went_up
and
Warren
raised
his
own
.
The
patrol
was
stopping
.
Prevot
came_up
``
Take
that
spot
over
there
''
,
he
whispered
,
pointing
to
a
small
clump
of
blackness
.
``
Give
me
your
machine_gun
ammo
''
.
Warren
handed
him
the
metal
box
and
Prevot
quietly
disappeared
down
the
line
.
Lying
in
the
grass
behind
the
brush
clump
,
Warren
looked
about
.
The
others
likewise
had
hidden
themselves
in
the
grass
and
the
brush
.
Over
his
shoulder
he
could
see
Prevot
with
the
machine_gun
crew
.
Even
at
this
short
distance
they
were
only
vague
shapes
,
setting_up
the
machine_gun
on
a
small
knoll
so
that
it
could
fire
above
the
heads
of
the
rest
of
the
patrol
.
Warren
eased
his
rifle
's
safety
off
and
gently
,
slowly
sneaked
another
clip
of
ammunition
from
one
of
the
cloth
bandoleers
that
marked
the
upper
part
of
his
body
with
an
X
.
This
he
placed
within
quick
reach
.
The
walk
and
his
fears
had
served
to
overheat
him
and
his
sweaty
armpits
cooled
at
the
touch
of
the
night
air
.
Although
the
armored
vest
fitted
the
upper
part
of
his
body
snugly
,
he
felt
no
security
.
Figures
seemed
to
crouch
in
the
surrounding
dark
;
in
the
distance
he
saw
a
band
of
men
who
seemed
to
advance
and
retreat
even
as
he
watched
.
Certain
this
menace
was
only
imaginary
,
he
yet
stared
in
fascinated
horror
,
his
hand
sticky
against
the
stock
of
his
weapon
.
He
was
aware
of
insistent
inner
beatings
,
as
if
prisoners
within
sought
release
from
his
rigid
body
.
Above
,
the
glowing
ivory
baton
of
their
searchlight
pointed
at
the
clouds
,
diluting
the
valley
's
dark
to
a
pallid
light
.
Then
the
figures
which
held
his
attention
became
a
group
of
shattered
trees
,
standing
like
the
grotesques
of
a
medieval
damnation
scene
.
Even_so
,
he
could
not
ease
the
tension
of
his
body
;
the
rough
surface
of
the
earth
itself
seemed
to
resist
every
attempt
on
his
part
to
relax
.
Sensing
the
unseen
presence
of
the
other
men
in
the
patrol
,
he
felt
mutely
united
to
these
nine
near
strangers
sharing
this
pinpoint
of
being
with
him
.
He
sensed
something
precious
in
the
perilous
moment
,
something
akin
to
the
knowledge
gained
on
his
bicycle
trip
through
the
French
countryside
,
a
knowledge
imprisoned
in
speechlessness
.
In
France
he
had
puzzled
the
meaning
of
the
great
stone
monuments
men
had
thrown
up
to
the
sky
,
and
always
as
he
wandered
,
he
felt
a
stranger
to
their
exultation
.
They
were
poems
in
a
strange
language
,
of
which
he
could
barely
touch
a
meaning
-
enough
to
make
his
being
ache
with
the
desire
for
the
fullness
he
sensed
there
.
Brittany
,
that
stone-gray
mystery
through
which
he
traveled
for
thirty
days
,
sleeping
in
the
barns
of
farmers
or
alongside
roads
,
had
worked
some
subtle
change
in
him
,
he
knew
,
and
it
was
in
Brittany
that
he
had
met
Pierre
.
Pierre
had
no
hands
;
they
had
been
severed
at
the
wrists
.
With
leather
cups
fitted
in
his
handlebars
,
he
steered
his
bicycle
.
He
and
Warren
had
traveled
together
for
four
days
.
They
visited
the
shipyards
at
Brest
and
Pierre
had_to
sign
the
register
,
vouching
for
the
integrity
of
the
visiting
foreigner
.
He
took
the
pen
in
his
stumps
and
began
to
write
.
``
Wait
!
Wait
''
!
cried
the
guard
who
ran
from
the
hut
to
shout
to
other
men
standing
about
outside
.
They
crowded
the
small
room
and
peered
over
one
another
's
shoulders
to
watch
the
handless
man
write
his
name
in
the
book
.
``
C'est
formidable
''
,
they
exclaimed
.
``
Mais
,
oui
.
C'est
merveilleux
''
.
And_then
the
questions
came
,
eager
,
interested
questions
,
and
many
compliments
on
his
having
overcome
his
infirmity
.
``
Does
n't
it
ever
bother
you
''
,
Warren
had
asked
,
``
to
have
people
always
asking
you
about
your
hands
''
?
``
Oh
,
the_French
are
a
very
curious
people
''
,
Pierre
had
laughed
.
``
They
are
also
honest
seekers
after
truth
.
Now
the_English
are
painfully
silent
about
my
missing
hands
.
They
refuse
to
mention
or
to
notice
that
they
are
not
there
.
The
Americans
,
like
yourself
,
take
the
fact
for
granted
,
try
to
be
helpful
,
but
do
n't
ask
questions
.
I'm
used_to
all
three
,
but
I
think
the_French
have
the
healthiest
attitude
''
.
That
was
the
day
that
Pierre
had
told
Warren
about
the
Abbey_of_Solesmes
.
``
You
are
looking
tired
and
there
you
can
rest
.
It
will
be
good_for_you
.
I
think
,
too
''
,
he
said
,
his
dark
eyes
mischievous
,
``
that
you
will
find
there
some
clue
to
the
secret
of
the
cathedrals
about
which
you
have
spoken
''
.
Within
two_weeks
Warren
was
ringing
the
bell
at
the
abbey
gate
.
The
monk
who
opened
the
door
immediately
calmed
his
worries
about
his
reception
:
``
I
speak
English
''
,
the
old_man
said
,
``
but
I
do
not
hear
it
very_well
''
.
He
smiled
and
stuck
a
large
finger
with
white
hairs
sprouting
on_it
into
his
ear
as
though
that
might
help
.
Smiling
at
Warren
's
protestations
,
the
old
monk
took
his
grip
from
him
and
led
him
down
a
corridor
to
a
small
parlor
.
``
Will
you
please
wait
in
here
.
