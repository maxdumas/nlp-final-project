Local
industry
's
investment
in
Rhode_Island
was
the
big
story
in
1960
's
industrial
development
effort
.
Fifty-two
companies
started
or
committed
themselves
to
new
plant
construction
,
totaling
1418000
square_feet
and
representing
an
investment
of
$
11900000
;
a
new
post-World_War
2
,
record
.
With
minor
exceptions
,
this
expansion
was
instituted
either
by
firms
based
in
Rhode_Island
or
out-of-state
manufacturers
already
operating
here
.
What
made
these
new
location
figures
particularly
impressive
was
the
fact
that
although
1960
was
a
year
of
mild
business
recession
throughout
the
nation
,
Rhode_Island
scored
marked
progress
in
new
industry
,
new
plants
,
and
new
jobs
.
Of
the
major
expansions
in
1960
,
three
were
financed
under
the
R._I._Industrial_Building_Authority
's
100
%
guaranteed
mortgage
plan
:
Collyer_Wire
,
Leesona_Corporation
,
and
American_Tube
+
Controls
.
Leading
firms
that
arranged
their
own
financing
included
Speidel_Corporation
,
Cornell-Dubilier
,
Photek
,
Inc._Division
of
Textron
,
Narragansett_Gray
Iron_Foundry
,
W._R._Cobb_Company
,
and
Mays_Manufacturing_Company
.
Expansion
and
relocation
of
industry
in
Rhode_Island
is
the
direct
responsibility
of
the
Development_Council
's
Industrial_Division
,
and
the
figures
quoted
above
indicate
a
successful
year
's
operation
.
Industrial_Division
personnel
worked
with
54
out-of-state
and
97
Rhode_Island
concerns
during
1960
,
many_of
whom
are
still
interested
in
a
Rhode_Island
location
.
They
are
conscious_of
this
state
's
new
feeling
of
optimism
and
assurance
and
are
definitely
impressed
by
the
number
of
new
plants
and
construction
projects
in
Rhode_Island
.
Although
much
of
the
Industrial_Division
's
promotional
effort
is
devoted
to
securing
new
locations
and
expansions
by
major
industries
,
small
business
is
also
afforded
considerable
attention
.
Our
Office
of
Foreign
and
Domestic
Commerce
carries_on
a
vigorous
program
,
directly
aimed
at
solving
and
expediting
the
problems
of
manufacturers
in
the
lower
employment
categories
.
A
primary
function
is
the
operation
of
a
Government_Bid_Center
,
which
receives
bids
daily
from
the
Federal_Government
's
principal
purchasing
agencies
.
Assistance
is
rendered
to
interested
Rhode_Island
businessmen
concerning
interpretation
of
bid
invitations
,
where
to
obtain
specifications
,
and
follow-ups
concerning
qualification
.
During
the
past
year
,
10517
government
bid
invitations
were
received
and
4427
procurement
leads
were
mailed
to
Rhode_Island
manufacturers
.
In_addition
,
the
Office
's
domestic
trade
program
provided
consultant
services
to
those
seeking
information
on
establishment
of
new
businesses
;
how
and
where
to
apply
for
financial
assistance
;
details
on
marketing
;
information
concerning
patents
,
copyrights
and
trade
marks
,
availability
of
technical
reports
,
and
other
subjects
of
interest
to
small
business
.
The
Office
of
Foreign
and
Domestic
Commerce
is
also
active
in
the
field
of
international
trade
,
assisting
Rhode_Island
firms
in
developing
and
enlarging
markets
abroad
.
This
office
cooperates
with
the
U._S.
Department_of_Commerce
in
giving
statewide
coverage
to
services
which
include
:
statistics
on
markets
abroad
;
locating
foreign_agents
,
buyers
,
distributors
,
etc.
;
information
on
foreign
and
domestic
import_duties
and
regulations
,
licensing
,
investments
,
and
establishing
of
branch
representatives
or
plants
abroad
,
and
documentary
requirements
concerning
export
shipments
and
arrangements
for
payment
.
During
the
year
1960
,
this
office
supplied
954
visitors
with
information
related
to
foreign
and
domestic
commerce
,
and
made
73
field
visits
.
Our
media
advertising
continued
,
during
1960
,
its
previous
effective
program
that
stressed
such
specifics
as
100
%
financing
,
plant
availabilities
,
and
location
advantages
.
We
also
continued
to
run
a
series
of
ads
featuring
endorsement
of
Rhode_Island
by
industrialists
who
had
recently
established
new
plants
here
.
To
reach
a
still
greater
audience
of
location-minded
manufacturers
,
our
industrial
advertising
budget
for
the
fiscal_year
was
increased
from
$
32000
to
$
40000
,
and
the
Industrial_Building_Authority
's
financial
participation
was
upped
from
$
17000
to
$
20000
.
Newspaper
advertising
was
mainly
concentrated
in
the
New_York
Times
and
the
Wall_Street
Journal
(
Eastern
and
Midwestern
editions
)
which
averaged
two
prominent
ads
per
month
,
and
to_a_lesser_degree
the
New_York
Herald_Tribune
and
,
for
the
west
coast
,
the
Los_Angeles
Times
and
the
Wall_Street
Journal
(
Pacific_Coast
edition
)
.
In_addition
to
the
regular
schedule
,
advertisements
were
run
for
maximum
impact
in
special
editions
of
the
New_York
Times
,
Boston_Herald
,
American_Banker
,
Electronic_News
and
,
for
local
promotion
,
the
Providence_Sunday_Journal
.
Magazine
advertising
included
Management
Methods
,
the
New_Englander
,
U._S._Investor
,
and
Plant_Location
.
The
direct
mail
campaign
consisted_of
3
intra
state
mailings
of
1680
letters
each
and
6
out-of-state
directed
to
electronics
,
plastics
,
pharmaceutical
,
and
business
machine
manufacturers
,
and
to
publishers
.
These
totaled
6768
pieces
of
correspondence
.
The
1960
advertising_campaign
brought
a
total
of
239
inquiries
;
164
from
media
and
75
from
direct
mail
.
Two
hundred
and
nineteen
were
received
from
35
of
our
50
United_States
and
11
came
from
foreign
countries
.
New_York
led
in
the
number
of
inquiries
,
followed
by
California
,
New_Jersey
,
Massachusetts
,
and
Pennsylvania
.
Among
foreign
countries
responding
were
Germany
,
Canada
,
Brazil
and
India
.
An
important
operation
in
soliciting
industrial
locations
involves
what
we
term
``
Missionary
calls
''
by
one
of_this
Division
's
industrial
promotion
specialists
.
These
consist_of
visits
,
without
previous
announcement
,
on
top
officials
of
manufacturing
concerns
located
in
highly
industrialized
areas
.
More_than
25
carefully
selected
cities
were
visited
,
including
New_York
,
Brooklyn
,
Long_Island
City
,
Newark
,
Elizabeth
,
Stamford
,
Waterbury
,
New_Haven
,
Bridgeport
,
Boston
,
Cambridge
,
Worcester
,
and
Waltham
.
Out
of
a
total
of
603
calls
,
452
contacts
were
established
with
top_executive
personnel
.
We
received
76
out-of-state
visitors
interested
in
investigating
Rhode_Island
's
industrial
advantages
,
and
Industrial_Division
personnel
made
55
out-of-state
follow-up
visits
.
During
1960
,
two
important
conferences
were
organized
by
the
Development_Council
's
Industrial_Division
.
In
June
,
the
Office
of
Foreign
and
Domestic
Commerce
-
in
conjunction
with
local
trade
associations
,
chambers_of_commerce
,
and
bank
officials
-
sponsored
a
World_Trade_Conference
at
the
Sheraton-Biltmore_Hotel
.
Its
purpose
was
to
find
ways
of
offsetting
the
United_States
'
declining
balance_of_trade
for
1958
and
1959
.
Approximately
100
representatives
of
business
attended
this
conclave
and
the
R._I._Export_Conference_Committee
later
voted
to
continue
the
activity
as
an
annual
event
.
On
October
8
th
of
last
year
,
the
Industrial_Division
sponsored
the
Governor
's
Conference
on
Industrial_Development
at
the
former
Henry_Barnard_School
.
A
comprehensive
program
devoted_to
the
various
phases
of
the
development
effort
attracted
143
interested
individuals
.
Morning
sessions
included
addresses
by
Ward_Miller
,
Jr.
of
the
U._S._Dept.
of
Commerce
.
Richard_Preston
,
executive_director
of
the
New_Hampshire
State_Planning
and
Development_Commission
,
and
Edwin_C._Kepler
of
General_Electric_Company
.
Workshop
sessions
in
the
afternoon
featured
development
executives
from
Pennsylvania
,
Connecticut
and
Maine
,
and
rounded_out
a
rewarding
program
.
In
connection
with
this
conference
,
a
64
-
page
supplement
was
published
in
the
October
2
nd
edition
of
the
Providence_Sunday_Journal
.
Devoted_to
the
improvement
in
business
climate
and
increase
in
industrial
construction
in
Rhode_Island
,
it
has
proved
a
valuable
mailing
piece
for
this
Division
.
More_than
2000
copies
have
been
sent_out
to
prospective
clients
.
Other
special
mailings
by
the
Industrial_Division
included
copies
of
speeches
delivered
at
the
Governor
's
Conference
,
letters
and
brochures
to
conferees
at
Med-Chemical_Symposium
at
University
of
Rhode_Island
and
letters
and
reprints
of
industrial
advertisements
to
such
organizations
as
Society
of
Industrial
Realtors
.
1184
copies
of
the
R._I._Directory
of
Manufacturers
were
distributed
:
643
in-state
and
541
out-of-state
.
The
Industrial_Division
published
,
in
1960
,
a
new
,
attractive
industrial
brochure
,
``
Rhode_Island
-
Right
For
Industry
''
,
and
prepared
copy
for
a
new_edition
of
the
Directory
of
Manufacturers
(
to
be
printed
shortly
)
,
and
for
a
new
space
catalogue
.
Additional
promotional
activities
included
organizing
the
dedication
program
for
Operation_Turnkey
,
the
new
automated
post_office
,
and
a
conference
with
representatives
of
Brown_University
,
Providence_College
,
and
University
of
Rhode_Island
,
and
eight
electronics
concerns
regarding
the
inauguration
of
a
training_program
for
electronics
personnel
.
Stated
in
its
simplest
terms
,
the
main
job
of
the
Planning_Division
is
to
plan
for
the
future
of
the
State
of
Rhode_Island
.
The
activities
of
the
Planning_Division
are
defined
in
considerable
detail
in
the
enabling_act
of
the
Development_Council
,
which
assigns
to
the
agency
both
broad
responsibilities
and
specific
duties
in
the
field
of
planning
.
Two
years
ago
,
the
Institute
of
Public_Administration
issued
an
extremely
comprehensive
report
entitled
``
State-Local
Relations
in
Metropolitan
Rhode_Island
.
As
the
result
of
an
exhaustive
review
of
the
recommendations
contained
in_this
report
,
plus
an
analysis
of
our
own
enabling_act
,
the
Planning_Division
developed
a_number_of
basic
planning
objectives
which
caused
a
reorientation
of
its
work
program
.
These
objectives
are
stated
here
because
of
their
importance
in
understanding
the
current
activities
of
the
Planning_Division
.
First
priority
will
be
given
to
the
preparation
of
a
meaningful
state
guide
plan
to
serve
as
a
background
for
all
other
planning
activities
in
the
state
.
Recognizing
the
truth
of
the
statement
by
the
Institute
of
Public_Administration
that
``
Metropolian_Planning
(
in
Rhode_Island
)
means
,
or
should
mean
,
state
planning
''
,
the
state
guide
plan
will
take_into_account
the
metropolitan
nature
of
many_of
Rhode_Island
's
problems
.
It
will
continue
to
be
an
objective
of_this
division
to
encourage
the
acceptance
of
planning
as
a
proper
and
continuing
responsibility
of
local_government
.
To
this
end
,
the
community
assistance
program
of
the
planning
division
will
continue
to
be
operated
as
a
staff
function
to
make
available
,
on
a
shared
cost
basis
,
technical
planning
assistance
to
those
communities
in
the
state
unable
to
maintain
their
own
planning
staff
.
The
planning
division
will
take
the
initiative
in
encouraging
planning
cooperation
at_all
levels
of
government
;
among
the
operating
departments
of
the
state
;
between
the
cities
and
towns
of
the
state
;
and
on
a
regional
basis
between
the
six
New_England
states
.
On
the
basis
that
all
citizens
of
the
state
are
entitled
to
benefit
equally
in
the
development
of
its
resources
,
plans
for
the
provision
of
essential
services
(
such_as
water
)
will
be
based
on
need
regardless_of
arbitrary
political
boundaries
,
within
the
framework
of
the
state
plan
.
The
state
development
budget
will
reflect
the
capital
needs
of
all
the
state
agencies
and
the
priority
of
the
projects
in
the
budget
will
be
based
on
the
state
plan
.
In
preparing
the
state
guide
plan
,
particular
attention
will
be
given
means
of
strengthening
the
economy
of
the
state
through
the
development
of
industry
and
recreation
.
Functionally
the
planning
division
carries_out
four
activities
:
long-range
state
planning
,
current
state
planning
,
local
planning
assistance
;
and
the
preparation
of
the
state
development
budget
.
The
planning
division
has
embarked_on
the_most
complete
and
comprehensive
state
planning
program
in
the
nation
.
The
long
range
aspects
of_this
program
are
divided
into
four
distinct
phases
:
basic
mapping
,
inventory
,
analysis
and
plan
and
policy
formation
.
The
work
program
,
as
it
was
originally
proposed
,
was
to
take
five
years
to
complete
.
Recent
events
-
particularly
the
necessity
of
providing
planning
information
for
the
statewide
origin
/
destination
study
of
the
Department
of
Public_Works
-
indicate
that
this
schedule
will
have
to
be
accelerated
.
The
basic
mapping
phase
of
the
program
has
been
completed
and
the
inventory
phase
is
scheduled
for
completion
July_1
,
1961
.
Since
accurate
base
maps
are
necessary
for
any
planning
program
,
the
first_step
taken
by
the
planning
division
to
implement
the
long
range
state
plan
has
been
to
prepare
two
series
of
base
maps
-
one
at
a
scale
of
1
inch
to
a
mile
,
and
the
second
a
series
of
26
sheets
at
a
scale
of
1
inch
to
2000
feet
,
covering
the
entire
state
.
With
these
maps
completed
,
the
inventory
phase
of
the
plan
has
been
started
.
With
the
aid
of
matching
federal
funds
available
under
Section
701
of
the
Housing_Act
of
1954
as
amended
,
the
planning
division
began
a
one
year
program
July_1
,
1960
to
complete
the
inventory
phase
of
the
state
planning
program
.
this
phase
consists_of
four
items
:
urban
land
use
,
rural
land
use
,
physical
features
and
public_utility
service_areas
.
Since
the
validity
of
all
subsequent
planning
depends_on
the
accuracy
of
the
basic
inventory
information
,
great_care
is
being
taken
that
the
inventory
is
as
complete
as
possible
.
The
urban
land
use
study
carried_out
by
the
planning
division
staff
has
consisted_of
identifying
and
mapping
all
urban
land
uses
which
are
of
significance
to
statewide
planning
.
The
rural
land
use
study
is
being
carried_out
under
contract
by
the
University
of
Rhode_Island
and
identifies
all
agricultural
land
uses
in
the
state
by
type
of
use
.
The
mapping
of
important
physical
features
such_as
slopes
and
types
of
soil
and
the
collection
of
all
available
information
pertaining
to
public_utility
service_areas
are
being
conducted
as
staff
projects
and
,
like
the
other
two
inventory
projects
,
are
scheduled
for
completion
July_1
,
1961
.
The
collection
of
information
is
meaningless
unless
it
is
understood
and
used
for
a
definite
purpose
.
