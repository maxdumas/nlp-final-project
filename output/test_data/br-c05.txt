The
superb
intellectual
and
spiritual
vitality
of
William_James
was
never
more
evident
than
in
his
letters
.
Here
was
a
man
with
an
enormous
gift
for
living
as_well
as
thinking
.
To
both
persons
and
ideas
he
brought
the
same
delighted
interest
,
the
same
open-minded
relish
for
what
was
unique
in
each
,
the
same
discriminating
sensibility
and
quicksilver
intelligence
,
the
same
gallantry
of
judgment
.
For
this
latest
addition
to
the
Great
Letters
Series
,
under
the
general
editorship
of
Louis_Kronenberger
,
Miss_Hardwick
has
made
a
selection
which
admirably
displays
the
variety
of
James
's
genius
,
not_to_mention
the
felicities
of
his
style
.
And_how
he
could
write
!
His
famous
criticism
of
brother
Henry
's
``
third
style
''
is
surely
as
subtly
,
even
elegantly
,
worded
an
analysis
of
the
latter
's
intricate
air_castles
as
Henry
himself
could
ever
have
produced
.
His
letter
to
his
daughter
on
the
pains
of
growing_up
is
surely
as
trenchant
,
forthright
,
and
warmly
understanding
a_piece
of
advice
as
ever
a
grown-up
penned
to
a
sensitive
child
,
and
with
just
the
right
tone
of
unpatronizing
good_humor
.
Most_of_all
,
his
letters
to
his
philosophic
colleagues
show
a
magnanimity
as_well
as
an
honesty
which
help
to
explain
Whitehead
's
reference_to
James
as
``
that
adorable
genius
''
.
Miss_Hardwick
speaks
of
his
``
superb
gift
for
intellectual
friendship
''
,
and
it
is
certainly
a
joy
to
see
the
intellectual
life
lived
so
free
from
either
academic
aridity
or
passionate
dogmatism
.
This
is
a
virtue
of_which
we
have
great
need
in
a
society
where
there
seems
to
be
an
increasing
lack
of
communication
-
or
even
desire
for
communication
-
between
differing
schools_of_thought
.
It
holds
an
equally
valuable
lesson
for
a
society
where
the
word
``
intellectual
''
has
become
a
term
of
opprobrium
to
millions
of
well-meaning
people
who
somehow
imagine
that
it
must
be
destructive
of
the
simpler
human
virtues
.
To
his
Harvard
colleague
,
Josiah_Royce
,
whose
philosophic
position
differed
radically
from
his
own
,
James
could
write
,
``
Different
as
our
minds
are
,
yours
has
nourished
mine
,
as
no
other
social
influence
ever
has
,
and
in
converse
with
you
I
have
always
felt
that
my
life
was
being
lived
importantly
''
.
Of
another
colleague
,
George_Santayana
,
he
could
write
:
``
The
great
event
in
my
life
recently
has
been
the
reading
of
Santayana
's
book
.
Although
I
absolutely
reject
the
Platonism
of_it
,
I
have
literally
squealed
with
delight
at
the
imperturbable
perfection
with
which
the
position
is
laid_down
on
page
after
page
''
.
Writing
to
his
colleague
George_Herbert_Palmer
-
``
Glorious
old
Palmer
''
,
as
he
addresses
him
-
James
says
that
if
only
the
students
at
Harvard
could
really
understand
Royce
,
Santayana
,
Palmer
,
and
himself
and
see
that
their
varying
systems
are
``
so
many
religions
,
ways
of
fronting
life
,
and
worth
fighting
for
''
,
then
Harvard
would
have
a
genuine
philosophic
universe
.
``
The
best
condition
of_it
would
be
an
open
conflict
and
rivalry
of
the
diverse
systems
.
The
world
might
ring
with
the
struggle
,
if
we
devoted
ourselves
exclusively
to
belaboring
each
other
''
.
The
``
belaboring
''
is
of_course
jocular
,
yet
James
was
not
lacking
in
fundamental
seriousness
-
unless
we
measure
him
by
that
ultimate
seriousness
of
the
great
religious_leader
or
thinker
who
stakes
all
on
his
vision
of
God
.
To
James
this
vision
never
quite
came
,
despite
his
appreciation
of_it
in
others
.
But
there
is
a
dignity
and
even
a
hint
of
the
inspired
prophet
in
his
words
to
one
correspondent
:
``
You
ask
what
I
am
going_to
'
reply
'
to
Bradley
.
But
why
need
one
reply
to
everything
and
everybody
?
I
think
that
readers
generally
hate
minute
polemics
and
recriminations
.
All
polemic
of
ours
should
,
I
believe
,
be
either
very
broad
statements
of
contrast
,
or
fine
points
treated
singly
,
and
as_far_as_possible
impersonally
.
As
far
as
the
rising
generation
goes
,
why
not
simply
express
ourselves
positively
,
and
trust
that
the
truer
view
quietly
will
displace
the
other
.
Here
again
'
God
will
know
his
own
''
'
.
The
collected
works
of
James_Thurber
,
now
numbering
25
volumes
(
including
the
present
exhibit
)
represent
a
high
standard
of
literary
excellence
,
as
every
schoolboy
knows
.
The
primitive-eclogue
quality
of
his
drawings
,
akin
to_that
of
graffiti
scratched
on
a
cave
wall
,
is
equally
well_known
.
About
all
that
remains
to
be
said
is
that
the
present
selection
,
most_of
which
appeared
first
in
The
New_Yorker
,
comprises
(
as_usual
)
a
slightly
unstrung
necklace
,
held
together
by
little
more_than
a
slender
thread
cunningly
inserted
in
the
spine
of
the
book
.
The
one
unifying
note
,
if
any
,
is
sounded
in
the
initial
article
entitled
:
``
How
to
Get_Through
the
Day
''
.
It
is
repeated
at
intervals
in
some
rather
sadly
desperate
word-games
for
insomniacs
,
the
hospitalized
,
and_others
forced
to
rely_on
inner_resources
,
including
(
in
the
P
's
alone
)
``
palindromes
''
,
``
paraphrases
''
,
and
``
parodies
''
.
``
The
Tyranny
of
Trivia
''
suggests
arbitrary
alphabetical
associations
to
induce
slumber
.
And
new
vistas
of
hairshirt
asceticism
are
opened
by
scholarly
monographs
entitled
:
``
Friends
,
Romans
,
Countrymen
,
Lend
Me
Your
Ear-Muffs
''
,
``
Such
a
Phrase
as
Drifts
Through
Dream
''
,
and
``
The
New_Vocabularianism
''
.
Some
of
Thurber
's
curative
methods
involve
strong
potions
of
mixed
metaphor
,
malapropism
,
and
gobbledygook
and
are
recommended
for
use
only
in
extreme
cases
.
A
burlesque
paean
entitled
:
``
Hark
the
Herald_Tribune
,
Times
,
and
All
the
Other
Angels
Sing
''
brilliantly
succeeds
in
exaggerating
even
motion-picture
ballyhooey
.
``
How_the_Kooks_Crumble
''
features
an
amusingly
accurate
take-off
on
sneaky
announcers
who
attempt
to
homogenize
radio
-
TV
commercials
,
and
``
The
Watchers
of
the
Night
''
is
a
veritable
waking
nightmare
.
A
semi-serious
literary
document
entitled
``
The
Wings
of
Henry_James
''
is
noteworthy
,
if
only
for
a
keenly
trenchant
though
little-known
comment
on
the
master
's
difficult
later
period
by
modest
Owen_Wister
,
author
of
``
The
Virginian
''
.
James
,
he
remarks
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
,
``
is
attempting
the
impossible
,
namely
,
to
produce
upon
the
reader
,
as
a
painting
produces
upon
the
gazer
,
a_number_of
superimposed
,
simultaneous
impressions
.
He
would
like
to
put
several
sentences
on
top
of
each
other
so_that
you
could
read
them
all_at_once
,
and
get
all_at_once
,
the
various
shadings
and
complexities
''
.
Equally
penetrating
in
its
fashion
is
the
following
remark
by
a
lady
in
the
course
of
a
literary
conversation
:
``
So_much
has
already
been
written
about
everything
that
you
can
n't
find_out
anything
about
it
''
.
Or
the
mildly
epigrammatic
utterance
(
also
a
quotation
)
:
``
Woman
's
place
is
in
the
wrong
''
.
Who
but
Thurber
can
be
counted_on
to
glean
such
nectareous
essences
?
A
tribute
to
midsummer
``
bang-sashes
''
seems
terribly
funny
,
though
it
would
be
hard
to
explain
why
.
``
One
of
them
banged
the
sash
of
the
window
nearest
my
bed
around
midnight
in
July
and
I
leaped
out
of
sleep
and
out_of_bed
.
'
It
's
just
a
bat
'
said
my
wife
reassuringly
,
and
I
sighed
with
relief
.
'
Thank
God
for
that
'
I
said
;
'
I
thought
it
was
a
human_being
''
'
.
In_a_sense
,
perhaps
,
Thurber
is
indebted
artistically
to
the
surrealist
painter
(
was
it
Salvador_Dali
?
)
who
first
conceived
the
startling
fancy
of
a
picture_window
in
the
abdomen
.
That_is
,
it
is
literally
a
picture_window
:
you
do
n't
see
into
the
viscera
;
you
see
a
picture
-
trees
,
or
flowers
.
This
is
something
like
what
Thurber
's
best
effects
are
like
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
.
Though
no_longer
able
to
turn_out
his
protoplasmic
pen-and-ink
sketches
(
several
old
favorites
are
scattered
through
the
present
volume
)
Thurber
has
retained
unimpaired
his
vision
of
humor
as
a
thing
of
simple
,
unaffected
humanness
.
In
his
concluding
paragraph
he
writes
:
``
The
devoted
writer
of
humor
will
continue
to
try
to
come
as
close_to
truth
as
he
can
''
.
For
many
readers
Thurber
comes
closer
than
anyone
else
in_sight
.
The
latest
Low
is
a
puzzler
.
The
master
's
hand
has
lost
none
of
its
craft
.
He
is
at
his
usual
best
in
exposing
the
shams
and
self-deceptions
of
political
and
diplomatic
life
in
the
fifties
.
The
reader
meets
a_few
old
friends
like
Blimp
and
the
TUC
horse
,
and
becomes
better
acquainted_with
new
members
of
the
cast_of_characters
like
the
bomb
itself
,
and
civilization
in
her
classic
robe
watching
the
nuclear
arms_race
,
her
hair
standing
straight
out
.
But
there
is
a
difference
between
the
present
volume
and
the
early
Low
.
There
is
fear
in
the
fifties
as
his
title
suggests
and
as
his
competent
drawings
show
.
But
there
was
terror
in
the
thirties
when
the
Nazis
were
on_the_loose
and
in
those
days
Low
struck
like
lightning
.
Anyone
can
draw
his
own
conclusions
from
this
difference
.
It
might
be
argued
that
the
Communists
are
less
inhuman
than
the
Nazis
and
furnish
the
artist
with
drama
in
a
lower
key
.
But
this
argument
cannot
be
pushed
very
far
because
the
Communist
system
makes_up
for
any
shortcomings
of
its
leaders
in
respect_to
corrosion
.
The
Communists
wield
a
power
unknown
to
Hitler
.
And
the
leading
issue
,
that
of
piecemeal
aggression
,
remains
the
same
.
This
is
drama
enough
.
Do
we
ourselves
offer
Mr._Low
less
of
a
crusade
?
In
the
thirties
we
would
not
face
our
enemy
;
that
was
a
nightmarish
situation
and
Low
was
in
his
element
.
Now
we
have
stood_up
to
the
Communists
;
we
are
stronger
and
more
self-confident
-
and
Low
cannot
so
easily
put
us
to
rights
.
Or
does
the
reason
for
less
Jovian
drawings
lie
elsewhere
?
It
might
be
that
Low
has
seen
too
many
stupidities
and
that
they
do
not
outrage
him
now
.
He
writes
,
``
Confucius
held
that
in
times
of
stress
one
should
take
short
views
-
only
up_to
lunchtime
''
.
Whatever
the
cause
,
his
mood
in
the
fifties
rarely
rises
above
the
level
of
the
capably
sardonic
.
Dulles
?
He
does
not
seem
to
have
caught
the
subtleties
of
the
man
.
McCarthy
?
The
skies
turn
dark
but
the
clouds
do
not
loose
their
wrath
.
Suez
?
Low
seems
to
have
supported
Eden
at_first
and_then
relented
because
things
worked_out
differently
,
so
there
is
no
fire
in
his
eye
.
Stalin
's
death
,
Churchill
's
farewell
to
public
life
,
Hillary
and
Tensing
on
Everest
,
Quemoy
and
Matsu
-
all
subjects
for
a
noble
anger
or
an
accolade
.
Instead
the
cartoons
seem
to
deal
with
foibles
.
Their
Eisenhower
is
insubstantial
.
Did
Low
decide
to
let
well
enough
alone
when
he
made
his
selections
?
He
often
drew
the
bomb
.
He
showed
puny
men
attacked
by
splendidly
tyrannical
machines
.
And
Khrushchev
turned_out
to
be
prime
copy
for
the_most
witty
caricaturist
of
them
all
.
But
,
but
and
but
.
Look
in_this
book
for
weak
mortals
and
only
on_occasion
for
virtues
and
vices
on
the
heroic
scale
.
Read
the
moderately
brief
text
,
not
for
captions
,
sometimes
for
tart
epigrams
,
once_in_a_while
for
an
explosion
in_the_middle
of
your
fixed
ideas
.
A
gray_fox
with
a
patch
on
one
eye
-
confidence_man
,
city_slicker
,
lebensraum
specialist
-
tries
to
take_over
Catfish_Bend
in_this
third
relaxed
allegory
from
Mr._Burman
's
refreshing
Louisiana
animal
community
.
The
fox
is
all
ingratiating
smiles
when
he
arrives
from
New_Orleans
,
accompanied
by
one
wharf_rat
.
But
like
all
despots
,
as
he
builds
his
following
from
among
the
gullible
,
he
grows
more
threatening
toward
those
who
won
n't
follow
-
such
solid
citizens
as
Doc_Raccoon
;
Judge_Black
,
the
vegetarian
black
snake
;
and
the
eagle
,
who
leads
the_bird
community
when
he
is
not
too
busy
in
Washington
posing
for
fifty-cent_pieces
.
As
soon
as
the
fox
has
taken_hold
on
most_of
the
populace
he
imports
more
wharf_rats
,
who
,
of_course
,
say
they
are
the
aggrieved
victims
of
an
extermination
campaign
in
the
city
.
(
The
followers
of
bullies
invariably
are
aggrieved
about
the
very
things
they
plan
to
do
to
others
.
)
They
train
the
mink
and
other
animals
to
fight
.
And
pretty
soon
gray_fox
is
announcing
that
he
won
n't
have
anyone
around
that
's
against
him
,
and
setting_out
to
break
his
second
territorial
treaty
with
the_birds
.
Robert_Hillyer
,
the
poet
,
writes
in
his
introduction
to
this
brief
animal
fable
that
Mr._Burman
ought_to
win
a
Nobel_Prize
for
the
Catfish_Bend
series
.
He
may
have
a
point
in
urging
that
decadent
themes
be
given
fewer
prizes
.
But
it
's
hard
to
imagine
Mr._Burman
as
a
Nobel_laureate
on
the
basis
of
these
charming
but
not
really
momentous
fables
.
In
substance
they
lie
somewhere
between
the
Southern
dialect
animal
stories
of
Joel_Chandler_Harris
(
Uncle_Remus
)
and
the
polished
,
witty
fables
of
James_Thurber
.
