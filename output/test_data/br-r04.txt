Up_to_date
,
however
,
his
garden
was
still
more_or_less
of
a
mess
,
he
had
n't
even
started
his
workshop
and
if
there
was
a
meadow
pond
in
the
neighborhood
he
had
n't
found
it
.
It
was
n't
his
fault
that
these
things
were
so
.
The
difficulty
was
that
each
day
seemed
to
produce
its
quota
of
details
which
must
be
cleaned_up
immediately
.
As
a
result
,
life
had
become
a
kind
of
continuous
make-ready
.
Once
he
disposed_of
these
items
which
screamed
so
harshly
for
attention
,
he
could
undertake
the
things
which
really
counted
.
Then
,
at_last
,
his
day
would
fall
into
an
ordered
pattern
and
he
would
be
free
to
read
,
or
garden
or
just
wander
through
the
woods
in
the
late
afternoon
,
accompanied
by
his
dogs
.
His
dogs
?
He
had
almost
forgotten
them
,
although
they
had
played
such
an
important
part
in
his
early
dreams
.
Then
they
had
always
been
romping
around
him
on
these
walks
,
yelping
with
delight
,
dashing
off
into
the
bushes
on
fruitless
hunting_expeditions
,
returning
to
jump
up
on
him
triumphantly
with
muddy
paws
.
Dogs
did
something
to
one
's
ego
.
They
were
constantly
assuring
you
that
you
were
one
of
the
world
's
great
guys
.
Regardless_of
how
much
of
a
slob
you
knew
yourself
to
be
,
you
could
be
certain
they
would
never
find_out
-
and
even
if
they
did
it
would
make
no
difference
.
Now
it
became
increasingly
apparent
that
there
were
to
be
no
dogs
in
the
picture
.
What
in
the
world
were
you
going
to
do
with
a_lot_of
dogs
when
you
left
for
town
on
Monday
afternoons
?
You
certainly
could
n't
take
them
into
the
little
apartment
and
if
you
tried
to
farm
them
out
for
two
or
three
days
every_week
they
would
become
so
confused
that
they
would
have
nervous_breakdowns
.
Why
in
the
world
could
n't
he
live
in
one
place
the
way
everyone
else
seemed
to
?
It
worried
him
,
this
inability
to
get
the
simplest
things
done
in
the
course
of
a
day
.
He
would
wake_up
in_the_middle
of
the
night
and
fret
about
it
.
How
in
the
world
had
he
formerly
found
time
to
build_up
a
business
,
raise
a
family
,
be
on
half_a_dozen
boards
,
work
actively
on
committees
and
either
go_out
in
the
evening
or
plow
through
the
contents
of
a
bulging
brief_case
?
Was
it
possible
that
as
people
grow
older
the
nature
of
time
changed
?
Could
it
be
that
it
speeded_up
for
the
aged
in
some
mysterious
way
,
as
if
a
bored
universe
were
skipping
through
the
end
of
the
chapter
just
to
get_it_over_with
?
Or
was
the
answer
less
metaphysical
?
Did
older
people
work
more
slowly
?
Did
it
take
a
man
of
sixty-five
longer
to
write
a
letter
,
shave
,
clean_out
a
barn
,
read
a
newspaper
,
than
a
man
of
thirty
?
Did
men
become
perfectionists
as
they
grew
older
,
polishing
,
polishing
,
reluctant
to
let_go
?
It
might
be
that
certain
people
were_born
with
a
compulsion
to
complicate
their
lives
,
while
others
could
live
blissfully
motionless
almost
indefinitely
,
like
lizards
in
the
sun
,
too
indolent
to
blink
their
eyes
.
Perhaps
it
was
his
misfortune
,
or
good_fortune
,
whichever
way
one
looked_at
it
,
to
belong_to
the
former
group
,
and
he
was
struggling
unconsciously
to
build_up
pressure
in
a
world
which
demanded
none
,
which
was
positively
antagonistic
to_it
.
And
then_again
perhaps
the
reason
why
he
could
n't
find
time
to
do
any
of
the
things
he
had
planned
to
do
after
retirement
:
reading
,
roaming
,
gardening
,
lying
on
his
back
and
watching
the
clouds
go_by
,
was
because
he
did
n't
want
to
do
them
.
There
was
no
compulsion
behind
them
.
They
could
be
done
or
left
undone
and
nobody
really
gave_a_damn
.
During
all
his
busy
life
he
had
only
done
things
which
had
to
be
done
.
This
habit
had
become
so
fixed
over
the
years
that
it
seemed
futile
to
do
anything
for
which
no_one
was
waiting
.
He
looked
at
the
luminous
dial
of
his
wrist_watch
.
It
was
five
minutes
after
four
.
On
some
distant
farm
a
rooster
crowed
and
,
far
down
the
valley
,
an
associate
answered
.
He
turned_over
impatiently
and
pulled
the
sheet
over
his
head
against
the
treacherous
encroachment
of
the
dawn
.
At_least
he
could
buy
the
equipment
for
his
workshop
.
Thus
committed
,
action
might
follow
.
He
went
down
to
Mills_and_Bradley
's
Hardware_Store
and
bought
a
full
set
of
carpenter
's
tools
,
including
a
rotary
power_saw
and
several
other
pieces
of
power
machinery
that
Mr._Mills
said
were
essential
for
babbiting
and
doweling
,
whatever
they
were
.
He
also
bought
a
huge
square
of
pegboard
for
hanging_up
his
tools
,
and
lumber
for
his
workbench
,
sandpaper
and
glue
and
assorted
nails
,
levels
and
T_squares
and
plumb_lines
and
several
gadgets
that
he
had
no
idea
how
to
use
or
what
they
were
for
.
``
There
''
,
said
Mr._Mills
.
``
That
'll
get
you
started
.
Best
not
to
get
everything
at_once
.
Add
things
as
you
find
you
need
'
em
''
.
He
did
n't
even
ask
the
cost
of
this
collection
.
After_all
,
if
you
were
going
to
set_up
a
workshop
you
had
to
have
the
proper
equipment
and
that
was
that
.
When
he
returned
home
,
the
station_wagon
loaded
with
tools
,
Jinny
had
gone
with
a
friend
to
some
meeting
in
the
village
,
using
the
recently
purchased
second
car
.
He
was
glad
.
It
gave
him
a
chance
to
unload
the
stuff
and
get
it
down
to
the
cellar
without
a
barrage
of
acid
comments
.
He
had
made
such
a
fuss
about
buying
that
second
car
that
he
knew
he
was
vulnerable
.
He
piled
everything
neatly
in
a
corner
of
the
cellar
and
turned
to
stare
at
the
blank
stone
wall
.
That
was
where
the
pegboard
would
go
on
which
he
would
hang
his
hand_tools
.
In_front
of
it
would
be
his
workbench
.
The
old
nightmare
which
had
caused
him
so
many
wakeful
hours
came
charging
in
on
him
once_more
,
only
this
time
he
could
n't
pacify
it
with
a
sleeping_pill
and
send
it
away
.
How
in
the
world
did
one
attach
a
pegboard
to
a
stone
wall
?
How
did
one
attach
anything
to
a
stone
wall
,
for_that_matter
?
After
the
pegboard
there
would
be
the
paneling
.
He
sat_down
on
an
old
box
and
focused_on
the
problem
.
Perhaps
one
bored
holes
in
the
stone
with
some
kind
of
an
electric
gadget
.
But
then
,
when
you
stuck
things
into
the
holes
,
why
did
n't
they
come
right
out
again
?
It
all
seemed
rather
hopeless
.
He
turned
his
attention
to
the
workbench
.
Perhaps
that
was
the
first
thing
to
do
.
A
workbench
had
a
heavy
top
and
sturdy
legs
,
but
how
did
you
attach
sturdy
legs
to
a
heavy
top
so
that
the
whole_thing
did
n't
wobble
like
a
newborn
calf
and
ultimately
collapse
when
you
leaned_on
it
?
Mr._Mills
had
done
some
figuring
on
a
scrap
of
paper
and
given
him
the
various
kinds
of
boards
and
two-by-fours
which
,
properly
handled
,
would
,
he
had
assured
him
,
turn_into
a
workbench
.
They
lay
on
the
cellar
floor
in
a
disorderly
pile
.
Mr._Crombie
poked_at
it
gingerly
with
his
foot
.
How
could
anyone
know
what
to
do
with
an
assortment
like
that
?
Perhaps
he
had_better
have
someone
help
him
put_up
the
pegboard
and
build
the
workbench
-
someone
who
knew
what
he
was
about
.
Then
at_least
he
would
have
a
place
to
hang
his
tools
and
something
to
work
on
.
After
that
everything
should
be
simpler
.
He
went
upstairs
to
phone
Crumb
.
To
his
amazement
he
reached
him
.
Mr._Crumb
was
laid_up
with
a
bad
cold
.
He
did
n't
seem
to
think
that
attaching
a
pegboard
to
a
stone
wall
was
much
of
a
problem
and
he
tossed_off
the
building
of
the
worktable
equally
lightly
.
The
only
trouble
was
that
he
himself
was
tied_up
on
the
school
job
.
That
was
why
he
had
n't
been
able
to
finish
the
porch
.
No
,
he
did
n't
know
of
any
handyman
carpenter
.
There
was
n't
any
such
thing
any_more
.
Carpenters
all
wanted
steady
work
and
at
the
moment
every
mother's_son
for
twenty
miles
around
that
could
hammer
nails
for
twenty-five
dollars
a
day
was
working_on
the
school
job
.
There
was
a
fellow
named
Blatz
over
Smithtown
way
.
Nobody
liked
to
hire
him
because
you
never
could
tell
when
he
was
going_to
be
taken
drunk
.
Mr._Crumb
would
probably
see
him
at
Lodge
Meeting
the
next
night
.
If
he
was
sober
,
which
was
doubtful
,
he
'd
have
him
get_in_touch
with
Mr._Crombie
.
Mr._Blatz
had
been
at_least
sober
enough
to
remember
to
telephone
and
he
turned_out
to
be
the
greatest
boon
that
had
come
into
Mr._Crombie
's
life
since
he
moved
to
Highfield
,
in_spite_of
the
fact
that
he
did
n't
work
very
fast
or
very
long
at_a_time
,
and
he
did
n't
like
to
work
at_all
unless
Mr._Crombie
hung_around
and
talked
to
him
.
He
said
he
was
the
lonely
type
and
working
in
a
cellar
you
saw
funny
things
coming
out
of
the
cracks
in
the
wall
if
they
was
n't
nobody
with
you
.
So
Mr._Crombie
sat
on
a
wooden
box
and
talked
in_order
to
keep
Mr._Blatz
's
mind
from
funny
things
.
At_the_same_time
he
watched
carefully
to
see
how
one
attached
pegboards
to
stone
walls
,
but
Mr._Blatz
was
usually
standing
in
his
line_of_vision
and
it
all
seemed
so
simple
that
he
did
n't
like
to
disclose
his
ignorance
.
While
Mr._Blatz
was
putting_up
the
pegboards
and
starting
the
workbench
,
Mr._Crombie
told
him
of
this
idea
about
paneling
the
whole
end
of
the
cellar
.
Mr._Blatz
agreed
that
this
would
be
pretty
.
Without
further
discussion
he
appeared
the
next
morning
with
a
pile
of
boards
sticking
over
the
end
of
his
light
truck
and
proceeded
with
the
paneling
,
which
he
then
stained
and
waxed
according_to
his
taste
.
``
Now
''
,
he
said
,
``
we
got
to
put_in
some
outlets
for
them
power_tools
;
then
a_couple_of
fluorescent
lamps
over
the
workbench
an
'
I
guess
we
're
about
through
down
here
''
.
It
all
did
look
very
efficient
and
shipshape
.
There
was
no
question
of_that
.
``
By_the_way
''
,
said
Mr._Blatz
,
packing
his
tools
into
a
battered
carrier
,
``
them
power_tools
needs
extra
voltage
.
I
guess
you
know
about
that
.
Before
you
use
'
em
the
light
company
's
got
to
run
in
a
heavy
line
and
you
'll
need
a
new
fuse
box
for
the
extra
circuits
.
That
ai
n't
too
bad
'
ceptin
'
the
light_company
's
so
busy
you
can
n't
ever
get
'
em
to
do
nothin
''
'
.
Instead
of
being
depressed
by
this
news
,
Mr._Crombie
was
actually
relieved
.
At_least
the
moment
was
postponed
when
he
had_to
face
the
mystery
of
the
power_tools
.
He
followed
Mr._Blatz
up
the
cellar
stairs
.
As_usual
,
Mrs._Crombie
was
standing
in_the_midst
of
a
confusion
of
cooking_utensils
.
Mr._Blatz
sat_down
in
the
only
unoccupied
kitchen
chair
.
``
Well
''
,
he
said
,
``
got
your
man
fixed_up
nice
down
there
.
He
oughta
be
able
to
build
a
new
house
with
all
them
contraptions
''
.
Mr._Crombie
watched
his
wife
with
an
anxious
expression
.
``
I
was
just
sayin
'
to
him
that
I
'm
all
ready
now
for
anything
else
you
want
done
''
.
Mr._Crombie
could
n't
remember
his
saying
any
such
thing
.
``
Oh
,
that
's
wonderful
''
,
cried
Mrs._Crombie
.
``
I
have
a_thousand
things
for
you
to
do
.
Doors
that
won
n't
open
,
and
doors
that
won
n't
close
and
shelves
and
broken
''
.
``
But
those
are
the
things
I
built
the
workshop
for
''
,
protested
Mr._Crombie
.
``
Those
are
the
things
I
can
do
,
now
that
I
'm
set_up
''
.
``
I
've
been
waiting
to
get
these
things
done
for
months
''
,
she
said
.
``
We
won
n't
live
long
enough
if
I
wait
for
you
,
besides
which
you
do
n't
need
to
worry
-
there
'll
be
plenty
more
''
.
But
the
discussion
was
academic
.
Mr._Blatz
was
already
taking
measurements
for
a
shelf
above
the
kitchen_sink
.
