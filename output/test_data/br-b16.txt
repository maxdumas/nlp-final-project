No_doubt
there
have
been
moments
during
every
Presidency
when
the
man
in
the
White_House
has
had
feelings
of
frustration
,
exasperation
,
exhaustion
,
and
even
panic
.
This
we
can
sympathetically
understand
.
But
no
President
ever
before
referred
to
his
as
a
``
lousy
job
''
[
as
Walter_Trohan
recently
quoted
President_Kennedy
as
doing
in
conversation
with
Sen._Barry_Goldwater
]
.
During
his
aggressive
campaign
to
win
his
present
position
,
Mr._Kennedy
was
vitriolic
about
this
country
's
``
prestige
''
abroad
.
What
does
he
think
a
remark
like
this
``
lousy
''
one
does
to
our
prestige
and
morale
?
If
the
President_of_the_United_States
really
feels
he
won
himself
a
``
lousy
job
''
,
then
heaven
help
us
all
.
Defense_Secretary_Robert_S._McNamara
has
asked
Congress
for
authority
and
funds
to
build
fallout
shelters
costing
about
200
million
dollars
.
Why
should
Congress
even
consider
allowing
such
a
sum
for
that
which
can
give
no
protection
?
Top
scientists
have
warned
that
an
area
hit
by
an
atomic
missile
of
massive
power
would
be
engulfed
in
a
suffocating
fire
storm
which
would
persist
for
a
long_time
.
The
scientists
have
also
warned
that
no
life
above
ground
or
underground
,
sheltered
or
unsheltered
could
be
expected
to
survive
in
an
area
at_least
50
miles
in_diameter
.
This
sum
spent
for
foreign
economic
aid
,
the
peace_corps
,
food
for
peace
,
or
any
other
program
to
solve
the
problems
of
the
underdeveloped
countries
would
be
an
investment
that
would
pay_off
in
world
peace
,
increased
world
trade
,
and
prosperity
for
every
country
on
the
globe
.
Let
us
prepare_for
peace
,
instead
of
for
a
war
which
would
mean
the
end
of
civilization
.
It
seems
college
is
n't
what
it
should
be
.
I
refer
to
the
attire
worn
by
the
students
.
Upon
a
visit
to
a
local
junior_college
last
week
,
I
was
shocked
to
see
the
young_ladies
wearing
short
shorts
and
the
young_men
wearing
Bermuda_shorts
.
Is
this
what
our
children
are
to
come
face_to_face
with
when
they
are
ready
for
college
in
a_few
years
?
Education
should
be
uppermost
in
their
minds
,
but
with
this
attire
how
can
anyone
think
it
is
so
?
It
looks
more
like
they
are
going_to
play
at
the
beach
instead
of
taking
lessons
on
bettering
themselves
.
High_school
students
have
more
sense
of
the
way
to
dress
than
college_students
.
Many
high_school
students
go_past
my
house
every_day
,
and
they
look_like
perfect
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
No_matter_how
hot
the
day
,
they
are
dressed
properly
and
not
in
shorts
.
The
granting
of
the
Jan_Masaryk
award
August
13
to
Senator_Paul_Douglas
is
a
bitter
example
of
misleading
minorities
.
Douglas
has
consistently
voted
to
aid
the
people
who
killed
Masaryk
,
and
against
principles
Masaryk
died
to
uphold
.
Douglas
has
voted
for
aid
to
Communists
and
for
the
destruction
of
individual
freedom
[
public
housing
,
foreign
aid
,
etc
.
]
.
In
today
's
``
Voice
''
,
the
CTA
is
urged
to
reduce
fares
for
senior_citizens
.
Rising
costs
have
increased
the
difficulties
of
the
elderly
,
and
I
would
be
the
last
to
say
they
should
not
receive
consideration
.
But
why
is
it
the
special
responsibility
of
the
CTA
to
help
these
people
?
Why
should
CTA
regular
riders
subsidize
reduced
transportation
for
old
people
any_more
than
the
people
who
drive
their
own
cars
or
walk
to
work
should
?
The
welfare
of
citizens
,
old
and
young
,
is
the
responsibility
of
the
community
,
not_only
of_that
part
of_it
that
rides
the
CTA
.
CTA
regulars
already
subsidize
transportation
for
school
children
,
policemen
,
and
firemen
.
In_reply
to
a
letter
in
today
's
``
voice
''
urging
the
sale
of
meat
after
6
p.
m.
,
I
wish
to
state
the
other
side
of
the
story
.
I
am
the
wife
of
the
owner
of
a
small
,
independent
meat
market
.
My
husband
's
hours
away_from_home
for
the
past
years
have
been
from
7
a.
m.
to
7
p.
m.
the
early
part
of
the
week
,
and
as
late
as
8
or
9
on
week-ends
.
Now
he
is
apparently
expected
to
give_up
his
evenings
-
and
Sundays
,
too
,
for
this
is
coming
.
There
is
a
trend
to
packaging
meat
at
a
central
source
,
freezing
it
,
and
shipping
it
to
outlying
stores
,
where
meat
cutters
will
not
be
required
.
If
a
customer
wishes
a
special
cut
,
it
will
not
be
available
.
We
are
slowly
being
regimented
to
having
everything
packaged
,
whether
we
want
it
or
not
.
Most
women
,
in_this
age
of
freezers
,
shop
for
the
entire
week
on
week-ends
,
when
prices
are
lower
.
Also
,
many
working
wives
have
children
or
husbands
who
take_over
the
shopping
chores
for
them
.
Independent
market
owners
work
six
days
a
week
;
and
my
husband
has
n't
had
a
vacation
in
14
years
.
No
,
we
are
not
greedy
.
But
if
we
closed
the
store
for
a
vacation
,
we
would
lose
our
customers
to
the
chain_stores
in
the
next
block
.
The
meat
cutters
'
union
,
which
has
a
history
of
being
one
of
the
fairest
and
least
corrupt
in
our
area
,
represents
the
little
corner
markets
as_well
as
the
large
supermarkets
.
What
it
is
trying
to
do
is
to
protect
the
little
man
,
too
,
as_well
as
trying
to
maintain
a
flow
of
fresh
meat
to
all
stores
,
with
choice
of
cut
being
made
by
the
consumer
,
not
the
store
.
I
,
too
,
congratulate
the
American_Legion
,
of_which
I
am
proud
to
have
been
a
member
for
more_than
40
years
,
on
the
recent
state
convention
.
I
regret
that
Bertha_Madeira
[
today
's
``
Voice
''
]
obtained
incorrect
information
.
Had
I
been
granted
the
floor
on
a
point
of
personal
privilege
,
the_matter
she
raised
would
have
been
clarified
.
The
resolution
under
discussion
at
the
convention
was
to
require
the
boards
of
election
to
instruct
judges
to
properly
display
the
American
flag
.
Judges
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Chicago
board
of
election
commissioners
are
instructed
to
do
this
.
The
resolution
further
asked
that
polling_place
proprietors
affix
an
attachment
to
their
premises
for
the
display
of
the
flag
.
It
was
my
desire
to
advise
the
membership
of
the
Legion
that
the
majority
of
polling_places
are
on
private_property
and
,
without
an
amendment
to
the
law
,
we
could
not
enforce
this
.
My
discussion
with_reference_to
the
resolution
was
that
we
should
commend
those
citizens
who
serve
as
judges
of
election
and
who
properly
discharge
their
duty
and
polling_place
proprietors
who
make
available
their
private
premises
,
and
not
by
innuendo
criticize
them
.
At_no_time
did
I
attempt
to
seek
approval
or
commendation
for
the
members
of
the
Chicago
board
of
election
commissioners
for
the
discharge
of
their
duties
.
The
Illinois_Commission
for
Handicapped
Children
wishes
to
commend
the
recent
announcement
by
the
Catholic
charities
of
the
archdiocese
of
Chicago
and
DePaul
university
of
the
establishment
of
the
Institute
for
Special_Education
at
the
university
for
the
training
of
teachers
for
physically
handicapped
and
mentally_retarded
children
.
In
these
days
of
serious
shortage
of
properly
trained
teachers
qualified
to
teach
physically
handicapped
and
mentally
handicapped
children
,
the
establishment
of
such
an
institute
will
be
a
major
contribution
to
the
field
.
The
Illinois_Commission
for
Handicapped
Children
,
which
for
20
years
has
had
the
responsibility
of
coordinating
the
services
of
tax
supported
and
voluntary
organizations
serving
handicapped
children
,
of
studying
the
needs
of
handicapped
children
in
Illinois
,
and
of
promoting
more
adequate
services
for
them
,
indeed
welcomes
this
new
important
resource
which
will
help
the
people
of
Illinois
toward
the
goal
of
providing
an
education
for
all_of
its
children
.
I
just
want
to
let
you
know
how
much
I
enjoyed
your
June
25
article
on
Liberace
,
and
to
thank
you
for
it
.
Please
do
put
more
pictures
and
articles
in
about
Liberace
,
as
he
is
truly
one
of
our
greatest
entertainers
and
a
really
wonderful
person
.
Is
this
,
perhaps
,
one
of
the
things
that
is
wrong
with
our
country
?
Engineering
graduates
of
Illinois_Institute
of
Technology
are
reported
receiving
the
highest
average
starting
salaries
in
the
school
's
history
-
$
550
a
month
.
My
son
,
who
has
completed
two
years
in
engineering_school
,
has
a
summer
job
on
a
construction
project
as
an
unskilled
laborer
.
At
a
rate
of
$
3.22
an
hour
he
is
now
earning
approximately
$
580
a
month
.
Ironic
,
is
it
not
,
that
after
completing
years
of
costly
scientific
training
he
will
receive
a
cut
in
pay
from
what
he
is
receiving
as
an
ordinary
unskilled
laborer
?

Editorial
comment
on
this
letter
appears
elsewhere

Your
July
26
editorial
regarding
the
position
of
Attorney_General
Robert_F._Kennedy
on
prospective
tax
relief
for
du_Pont
stockholders
is
based
on
an
erroneous
statement
of
fact
.
As
a
result
,
your
criticism
of
Attorney_General
Robert_F._Kennedy
and
the
department_of_justice
was
inaccurate
,
unwarranted
and
unfair
.
The
editorial
concerned
legislative
proposals
to
ease
the
tax
burden
on
du_Pont
stockholders
,
in
connection
with
the
United_States
Supreme_court
ruling
that
du_Pont
must
divest
itself
of
its
extensive
General
Motors
stock
holdings
.
These
proposals
would
reduce
the
amount
of
tax
that
du_Pont
stockholders
might
have
to
pay
-
from
an
estimated
1.1
billion
dollars
under
present
law
to
as
little
as
192
million
dollars
.
Congressman_Wilbur_D._Mills
,
chairman
of
the
House
Ways
and
Means
committee
,
asked
the
department_of_justice
for
its
views
on
these
legislative
proposals
as
they
related
to
anti-trust
law_enforcement
.
The
attorney_general
responded
by
letter
dated
July
19
.
Copies
of_this
letter
were
made
available
to
the
press
and
public
.
In_this
letter
,
Mr._Kennedy
made
it
clear
that
he
limited
his
comment
only
to
one
consideration
-
what
effect
the
legislative
proposals
might
have
on
future
anti-trust
judgments
.
There
are
a_number_of
other
considerations
besides
this
one
but
it
is
for
the
Congress
,
not
the
department_of_justice
,
to
balance
these
various
considerations
and
make
a
judgment
about
legislation
.
Yet
your
editorial
said
:
``
Now
the
attorney_general
writes
that
no
considerations
'
justify
any
loss
of
revenue
of_this
proportion
''
'
.
What
Mr._Kennedy
,
in_fact
,
wrote
was
:
``
It
is
the
department
's
view
that
no
anti-trust
enforcement
considerations
justify
any
loss
of
revenue
of_this
proportion
''
.
The
editorial
,
by
omitting
the
words
anti-trust
enforcement
,
totally
distorted
Mr._Kennedy
's
views
.
The
headline
is
offensive
,
particularly
in_view
of
the
total
inaccuracy
of
the
editorial
.
I
concur
most
heartily
with
today
's
letter
on
the
futility
of
writing
to
Sen._Dirksen
and
Sen._Douglas
.
But
when
you
write
to
Congresswoman_Church
,
bless
her
heart
,
your
letter
is
answered
fully
and
completely
.
Should
she
disagree
,
she
explains
why
in_detail
.
When
she
agrees
,
you
can
rest
assured
her
position
will
remain
unchanged
.
I
think
we
have
the
hardest
working
,
best
representative
in
Congress
.
A
recent
news_story
reported
that
Frank_Sinatra
and
Dean_Martin
delayed
103
airplane
passengers
10
minutes
in
London
while
they
finished
their
drinks
.
They
do
our
country
great
harm
by
such
actions
.
Those
in_the_public_eye
should
be
good_examples
of
American
citizens
while
abroad
.
The
plane
should
have
started
at
the
scheduled
time
and
left
Sinatra
and
Martin
to
guzzle
.
Overt
socialism
means
government
ownership
and
management
of
a
nation
's
main
industries
.
In
covert
socialism
-
toward
which
America
is
moving
-
private
enterprise
retains
the
ownership
title
to
industries
but
government
thru
direct
intervention
and
excessive
regulations
actually
controls
them
.
In_order_to
attract
new
industries
,
15
states
or
more
are
issuing
tax
free
bonds
to
build
government
owned
plants
which
are
leased
to
private
enterprise
.
This
is
a
step
toward
overt
socialism
.
Issuing
bonds
for
plant
construction
has
brought
new
industries
to
certain
regions
.
