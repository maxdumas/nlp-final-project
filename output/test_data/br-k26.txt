But
they
all
said
,
``
No
,
your
time
will
come
.
Enjoy
being
a
bride
while
you
can
''
.
There
was
no
room
for
company
in
the
tiny
Weaning_House
(
where
the
Albright
boys
always
took
their
brides
,
till
they
could
get
a
house
and
a
farm
of
their
own
)
.
So
when
the
Big_House
filled_up
and
ran_over
,
the
sisters-in-law
found
beds
for
everyone
in
their
own
homes
.
And
there
was
still
not
anything
that
Linda_Kay
could
do
.
So
Linda_Kay
gave_up
asking
,
and
accepted
her
reprieve
.
Without
saying
so
,
she
was
really
grateful
;
for
to
attend
the
dying
was
something
she
had
never
experienced
,
and
certainly
had
not
imagined
when
she
thought_of
the
duties
she
would
have
as
Bobby_Joe
's
wife
.
She
had
made
curtains
for
all
the
windows
of
her
little
house
,
and
she
had
kept
it
spotless
and
neat
,
shabby
as
it
was
,
and
cooked
good
meals
for
Bobby_Joe
.
She
had
done
all
the
things
she
had
promised
herself
she
would
do
,
but
she
had
not
thought_of
this
.
People
died
,
she
would
have
said
,
in
hospitals
,
or
in
cars
on
the
highway
at
night
.
Bobby_Joe
was
gone
all
day
now
,
not
coming_in
for
dinner
and
sometimes
not
for
supper
.
When
they
first
married
he
had
been
working
in
the
fields
all
day
,
and
she
would
get_in
the
car
and
drive
to
wherever
he
was
working
,
to
take
him
a
fresh
hot
meal
.
Now
there
was
no
work
in
the
fields
,
nor
would
there
be
till
it
rained
,
and
she
did
not
know
where
he
went
.
Not
that
she
complained
,
or
had
any
cause
to
.
Four
or
five
of
the
cousins
from
East_Texas
were
about
his
age
,
so
naturally
they
ran_around
together
.
There
was
no
reason
for
her
to
ask
what
they
did
.
Thus
a
new
pattern
of
days
began
to
develop
,
for
Granny_Albright
did
not
die
.
She
lay
still
on
the
bed
,
her
head
hardly
denting
the
pillow
;
sometimes
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked_around
,
and
sometimes
she
took
a_little
milk
or
soup
.
They
stopped
expecting
her
to
die
the
next
minute
,
but
only
in
the
next
day
or
two
.
Those
who
had
driven
hundreds
of
miles
for
the
burial
would
not
go_home
,
for
she
might
die
any
time
;
but
they
might
as_well
unpack
their
suitcases
,
for
she
might
linger
on
.
So
the
pattern
was
established
.
When
Linda_Kay
had
put_up
her
breakfast
dishes
and
mopped
her
linoleum
rugs
,
she
would
go_to
the
Big_House
.
There
was
not
anything
she
could
do
there
,
but
that
was
where
everyone
was
,
or
would
be
.
Bobby_Joe
and
the
boys
would
come_by
,
say
``
How
's
Granny
''
?
and
sit
on
the
porch
a
while
.
The
older
men
would
be
there
at
noon
,
and
maybe
rest
for
a
time
before
they
took
their
guns
off
to
the
creek
or
drove
down
the
road
towards
town
.
The
women
and
children
stayed_at
the
Albrights
'
.
The
women
,
keeping
their
voices
low
as
they
worked
around
the
house
or
sat
in
the
living_room
,
sounded
like
chickens
shut_up
in
a
coop
for
the
night
.
The
children
had
to
play
away
from
the
house
(
in
the
barn
loft
or
the
pasture
behind
the
barn
)
,
to
maintain
a
proper
quietness
.
Off_and_on
,
all
day
,
someone
would
be
wiping
at
the
powdery
gray
dust
that
settled
over
everything
.
The
evaporative_cooler
had
been
moved
to
Granny
's
room
,
and
her
door
was
kept
shut
;
so
that
the
rest
of
the
house
stayed
open
,
though
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
it
was
hotter
or
cooler
that
way
.
The
dust
clogged
their
throats
,
and
the
heat
parched
them
,
so
that
the
women
were
always
making
ice_water
.
They
had
cleaned_up
an
old
ice_box
and
begun
to
buy
fifty
pound
blocks
of
ice
in
town
,
as
the
electric_refrigerator
came
nowhere
near
providing
enough
ice
for
the
crowds
who
ate
and
drank
there
.
One
afternoon
,
as
the
women
sat
clucking
softly
,
a
new
carload
of
people
pulled_up
at
the
gate
.
It
was
a
Cadillac
,
black
grayed
with
the
dust
of
the
road
,
its
windows
closed
tight
so
you
knew
that
the
people
who
climbed
out
of_it
would
be
cool
and
unwrinkled
.
They
were
an
old
fat
couple
(
as
Linda_Kay
described
them
to
herself
)
,
a
thick
middle-aged
man
,
and
a
girl
about
ten
or
twelve
.
There
was
much
embracing
,
much
exclaiming
.
``
Cousin_Ada
!
Cousin_John
''
!
``
Cousin_Lura
''
!
``
Cousin_Howard
''
!
``
And
how
is
she
''
?
``
About
the
same
,
John
,
about
the
same
''
.
All
the
women
got_up
and
offered
their
chairs
,
and
when
they
were
all
seated
again
,
the
guests
made
their
inquiries
and
their
explanations
.
``
We
were
on
our
vacation
in
Canada
''
,
Howard
explained
,
in
a
muffled
voice
that
must
have
been
used_to
booming
,
``
and
the
news
did
n't
catch_up_with
us
till
we
were
nearly
home
.
We
came_on
as_soon_as
we
could
''
.
There
was
the
suggestion
of
ice_water
,
and
-
in_spite
of
the
protest
``
We
're
not
really
thirsty
''
-
Linda_Kay
,
to
escape
the
stuffy
air
and
the
smothering
soft
voices
,
hurried
to
the
kitchen
.
She
filled
a
big
pitcher
and
set
it
,
with
glasses
,
on
a
tray
.
Carrying
it
to
the
living_room
,
she
imagined
the
picture
she
made
:
tall
and
roundly
slim
,
a_bit
sophisticated
in
her
yellow
sheath
,
with
a
graceful
swingy
walk
that
she
had
learned
as
a
twirler
with
the
school
band
.
Almost
immediately
she
was
ashamed
of
herself
for
feeling
vain
,
at
such
a
time
,
in
such
a
place
,
and
she
tossed_back
her
long
yellow
hair
,
smiling
shyly
as
she
entered
the
room
.
Howard
(
the
thick
middle-aged
man
)
was
looking
at
her
.
She
felt
the
look
and
looked
back
because
she
could
not
help
it
,
seeing
that
he
was
neither
as
old
nor
as
thick
as
she
had
at_first
believed
.
``
And
who
is
this
''
?
he
asked
,
when
she
passed
him
a
glass
.
``
Oh
that
's
Linda_Kay
''
,
Mama_Albright
said
fondly
.
``
She
married
our
baby
boy
,
Bobby_Joe
,
this
summer
''
.
``
Let
's
see
''
,
Cousin_Ada
said
.
``
He
's
a
right_smart
younger
than
the
rest
''
?
``
Oh
yes
''
,
Mama
laughed
.
``
He
's
ten
years
younger
than
Ernest
.
We
did
n't
expect
him
to
come_along
;
thought
for
the
longest
he
was
a
tumor
''
.
This
joke
was
not
funny
to
Linda_Kay
,
and
she
blushed
,
as
she
always
did
;
then
,
hearing
the
muffled
boom
of
Howard
's
laughter
,
blushed
redder
.
``
Who
is
Howard
,
anyway
''
?
she
asked
Bobby_Joe
that
night
.
``
He
makes
me
uncomfortable
''
.
``
Oh
he
's
a
second_cousin
or
something
.
He
got_in
the
oil_business
out
at
Odessa
and
lucked_into
some
money
''
.
``
How
old
is
he
''
?
``
Gosh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
Thirty-five
,
I
guess
.
He
's
been
married
and
got
this
half
grown
kid
.
If
he
bothers
you
,
do
n't
pay
him
any
mind
.
He
's
just
a
big
windbag
''
.
Bobby_Joe
was
thinking_about
something
else
.
``
Say
,
did
you
know
they
're
fixing
to
have
a
two
day
antelope
season
on
the
Double_X
''
?
He
was
talking_about
antelope
again
when
they
woke_up
.
``
Listen
,
I
never
had
a
chance
to
kill
an
antelope
.
There
never
was
a
season
before
,
but
now
they
want
to
thin
'em
out
on_account_of
the
drouth
''
.
``
Did
he
ever
visit
here
when
he
was
a
kid
''
?
Linda_Kay
asked
.
``
Who
''
?
``
Howard
''
.
``
Hell
,
I
do
n't
know
.
When
he
was
a
kid
I
was
n't
around
''
.
Bobby_Joe
took
a
gun
from
behind
the
door
,
and
with
a
quick
``
Bye_now
''
was
gone
for
the
day
.
Almost
immediately
Howard
and
his
daughter
Debora
drove_up
in
the
Cadillac
.
``
We
're
going_after
ice
''
,
Howard
said
,
``
and
thought
maybe
you
'd
go
along
and
keep
us
company
''
.
There
was
really
no
reason
to
refuse
,
and
Linda_Kay
had
never
ridden
in
a
Cadillac
.
Driving
along
the
caliche-topped
road
to
town
,
Howard
talked
.
Finally
he
said
,
``
Tell
me
about
yourself
''
,
and
Linda_Kay
told
him
,
because
she
thought
herself
that
she
had
had
an
interesting
life
.
She
was
such
a
well-rounded
teenager
,
having
been
a
twirler
,
Future_Farmers
sweetheart
,
and
secretary
of
Future_Homemakers
.
In
her
sophomore
year
she
had
started
going_steady
with
Bobby_Joe
,
who
was
a
football_player
,
Future_Homemakers
sweetheart
,
and
president
of
Future_Farmers
.
It
was
easy
to
see
that
they
were
made_for
each
other
,
and
they
knew
what
they
wanted
.
Bobby_Joe
would
be
a
senior
this
year
,
and
he
planned
to
graduate
.
But
there
was
no
need
for
Linda_Kay
to
go_on
,
since
all
she
wanted
in
life
was
to
make
a
home
for
Bobby_Joe
and
(
blushing
)
raise
his
children
.
Howard
sighed
.
``
You
lucky
kids
''
,
he
said
.
``
I
'd
give
anything
if
I
could
have
found
a
girl
like
you
''
.
Then
he
told
Linda_Kay
about
himself
.
Of_course
he
could
n't
say
much
,
really
,
because
of
Debora
,
but
Linda_Kay
could
imagine
what
kind
of
woman
his
wife
had
been
and
what
a
raw_deal
he
had_got
.
It
made
her
feel
different
about
Howard
.
She
was
going_to
tell
Bobby_Joe
about
how
mistaken
she
had
been
,
but
he
brought
one
of
the
cousins
home
for
supper
,
and
all
they
did
was
talk_about
antelope
.
Bobby_Joe
was
trying
to
get
Linda_Kay
to
say
she
would
cook
one
if
he
brought
it
home
.
``
Cook
a
whole
antelope
''
?
she
exclaimed
.
``
Why
,
I
could
n't
even
cook
a
piece
of
antelope
steak
;
I
never
even
saw
any
''
.
``
Oh
,
you
could
.
I
want
to
roast
the
whole_thing
,
and
have
it
for
the
boys
''
.
Linda_Kay
told
him
he
could
n't
do
anything
like
that
with
his
Grandma
dying
,
and
he
said
well
they
had_to
eat
,
did
n't
they
,
they
were
n't
all
dying
.
Linda_Kay
felt_like
going_off
to
the
bedroom
to
cry
;
but
they
were
going_up
to
the
Big_House
after
supper
,
and
she
had_to
put_on
a
clean
dress
and
fix
her
hair
a_little
.
Every_night
they
all
went_to
Mama
and
Papa
Albright
's
,
and
sat
on
the
open
front_porch
,
where
they
could
get
the
breeze
.
It
was
full-of-the-moon
(
or
a_little
past
)
,
and
nearly
light
as
day
.
They
all
sat
around
and
drank
ice_water
,
and
the
men
smoked
,
and
everybody
had
a
good
time
.
Once_in_a_while
they
said
what
a
shame
it
was
,
with
Granny
dying
,
but
they
all
agreed
she
would
n't
have
wanted
it
any
other
way
.
That
night
the
older
men
got_to
talking_about
going
possum
hunting
on
a
moonlight
night
.
Bobby_Joe
and
two
or
three
of
the
other
boys
declared
they
had
never
been
possum
hunting
,
and
Uncle_Bill_Farnworth
(
from
Mama_Albright
's
side
of
the
family
)
said
he
would
just
get_up
from
there
and
take
them
,
right
then
.
After
they
had
left
,
some
of
the
people
moved
around
,
to
find
more
comfortable
places
to
sit
.
There
were
not
many
chairs
,
so
that
some
preferred
to
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
porch
,
resting
their
feet
on
the
ground
,
and_others
liked
to
sit
where
they
could
lean_back
against
the
wall
.
Howard
,
who
had
been
sitting
against
the
wall
,
said
he
needed
more
fresh
air
,
and
took
the
spot
on
the
edge
of
the
porch
where
Bobby_Joe
had
been
sitting
.
``
You
'll
be
a
darn
sight
more
comfortable
there
,
Howard
''
,
Ernest
said
,
laughing
,
and
they
all
laughed
.
Linda_Kay
felt
that
she
was
not
exactly
more
comfortable
.
Bobby_Joe
had
been
sitting
close
to
her
,
touching
her
actually
,
and
holding
her
hand
from_time_to_time
,
but
it
seemed
at_once
that
Howard
sat
much
closer
.
Perhaps
it
was
just
that
he
had
so
much
more
flesh
,
so
that
more
of
it
seemed
to
come
in
contact
with
hers
;
but
she
had
never
been
so
aware
of
anyone
's
flesh
before
.
Still
she
was
not
sorry
he
sat
by
her
,
but
in_fact
was
flattered
.
He
had
become
the
center
of
the
company
,
such
stories
he
had
to
tell
.
He
had
sold
oil
stock
to
Bob_Hope
and
Bing_Crosby
in_person
;
he
had
helped
fight
an
oil-well
fire
that
raged
six
days
and
nights
.
