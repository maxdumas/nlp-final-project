The
nuclear
war
is
already
being
fought
,
except
that
the
bombs
are
not
being
dropped
on
enemy
targets
-
not_yet
.
It
is
being
fought
,
moreover
,
in
fairly
close
correspondence
with
the
predictions
of
the
soothsayers
of
the
think_factories
.
They
predicted
escalation
,
and
escalation
is
what
we
are
getting
.
The
biggest
nuclear
device
the
United_States
has
exploded
measured
some
15
megatons
,
although
our
B-52s
are
said
to
be
carrying
two
20
-
megaton_bombs
apiece
.
Some
time
ago
,
however
,
Mr._Khrushchev
decided
that
when
bigger
bombs
were
made
,
the
Soviet_Union
would
make
them
.
He
seems
to
have
at_least
a_few
30
-
and
50
-
megaton_bombs
on_hand
,
since
we
cannot
assume
that
he
has
exploded
his
entire
stock
.
And
now
,
of_course
,
the
hue_and_cry
for
counter
escalation
is
being
raised
on
our
side
.
Khrushchev
threatens
us
with
a
100
-
megaton_bomb
?
So_be_it
-
then
we
must
embark_on
a
crash
program
for
200
-
megaton_bombs
of
the
common
or
hydrogen
variety
,
and
neutron_bombs
,
which
do
not
exist
but
are
said
to
be
the
coming
thing
.
So
escalation
proceeds
,
ad_infinitum
or
,
more
accurately
,
until
the
contestants
begin
dropping
them
on
each
other
instead_of
on
their
respective
proving_grounds
.
What
is
needed
,
Philip_Morrison
writes
in
The_Cornell_Daily_Sun
(
October
26
)
is
a
discontinuity
.
The
escalation
must
end
sometime
,
and
probably
quite
soon
.
``
Only
a
discontinuity
can
end
it
''
,
Professor_Morrison
writes
.
``
The
discontinuity
can
either
be
that
of
war
to
destruction
,
or
that
of
diplomatic
policy
''
.
Morrison
points_out
that
since
our
country
is
more
urbanized
than
the
Soviet_Union
or
Red_China
,
it
is
the
most
vulnerable
of
the
great_powers
-
Europe
of_course
must
be
written_off
out_of_hand
.
He
feels
,
therefore
,
that
to
seek
a
discontinuity
in
the
arms
policy
of
the
United_States
is
the
least
risky
path
our
government
can
take
.
His
proposal
is
opposed
to
that
of
Richard_Nixon
,
Governor_Rockefeller
,
past
chairmen
Strauss
and
McCone
of
the
Atomic_Energy_Commission
,
Dr._Edward_Teller
and
those
others
now
enjoying
their
hour
of
triumph
in
the
exacerbation
of
the
cold_war
.
These
gentlemen
are
calling_for
a
resumption
of
testing
-
in
the
atmosphere
-
on
the
greatest
possible
scale
,
all
in_the_name_of
national
security
.
Escalation
is
their
first
love
and
their
last
;
they
will
be
faithful
unto
death
.
Capable
as
their
minds
may
be
in
some
directions
,
these
guardians
of
the
nation
's
security
are
incapable
of
learning
,
or
even
of
observing
.
If
this
capacity
had
not
failed
them
,
they
would
see
that
their
enemy
has
made
a
disastrous
miscalculation
.
He
has
gained
only
one
thing
-
he
has
exploded
a
50
-
megaton_bomb
and
he
probably
has
rockets
with
sufficient
thrust
to
lob
it
over
the
shorter
intercontinental
ranges
.
But
if
his
purpose
was
to
inspire
terror
,
his
action
could
hardly
have
miscarried
more
obviously
.
Not
terror
,
but
anger
and
resentment
have
been
the
general
reaction
outside
the
Soviet
sphere
.
Khrushchev
himself
is
reported
to
be
concerned
by
the
surge
of
animosity
he
has
aroused
,
yet
our
own
nuclear
statesmen
seem
intent_on
following
compulsively
in
his
footsteps
.
When
one
powerful
nation
strives
to
emulate
the
success
of
another
,
it
is
only
natural
.
Thus
,
when
the
Russians
sent
up
their
first
sputnik
,
American
chagrin
was
human
enough
,
and
American
determination
to
put
American
satellites
into
orbit
was
perfectly
understandable
.
But
to
imitate
an
opponent
when
he
has
made
the
mistake
of
his
life
would
be
a
new
high
in
statesmanlike
folly
.
When
East_Germans
fled
to
the
West
by
the
thousands
,
paeans
of
joy
rose
from
the
throats
of
Western
publicists
.
They
are
less
vocal
now
,
when
it
is
the
West_Berliners
who
are
migrating
.
The
flood
is
not
as
great
-
only
700
a
week
according_to
one
apparently
conservative
account
-
but
it
is
symptomatic
.
West_Berlin
morale
is
low
and
,
in
age
distribution
,
the
situation
is
unfavorable
.
Nearly
18
per_cent
of
West_Berlin
's
2200000
residents
are
sixty-five
or
older
,
only
12.8
per_cent
are
under
fifteen
.
R._H._S._Crossman
,
M.P.
,
writing
in
The_Manchester_Guardian
,
states
that
departures
from
West_Berlin
are
now
running
at
the
rate
not
of
700
,
but
of
1700
a
week
,
and
applications
to
leave
have
risen
to
1900
a
week
.
The
official
statistics
show
that
60
per_cent
are
employed
workers
or
independent
professional
people
.
Whole
families
are
moving
and
removal_firms
are
booked
for
months
ahead
.
The
weekly
loss
is
partly
counterbalanced
by
500
arrivals
each_week
from
West_Germany
,
but
the
hard
truth
,
says
Crossman
,
is
that
``
The
closing_off
of
East_Berlin
without
interference
from
the
West
and
with
the
use
only
of
East_German
,
as
distinct
from
Russian
,
troops
was
a
major
Communist
victory
,
which
dealt
West_Berlin
a
deadly
,
possibly
a
fatal
,
blow
.
The
gallant
half
city
is
dying
on_its_feet
''
.
Another
piece
of
evidence
appears
in
a
dispatch
from
Bonn
in
the
Observer
(
London
)
.
Mark_Arnold-Foster
writes
:
``
People
are
leaving
[
West_Berlin
]
because
they
think
it
is
dying
.
They
are
leaving
so
fast
that
the
president
of
the
West_German_Employers'_Federation
issued
an
appeal
this
week
to
factory_workers
in
the
West
to
volunteer
for
six
months
'
front-line
work
in
factories
in
West_Berlin
.
Berlin
's
resilience
is
amazing
,
but
if
it
has
to
hire
its
labor
in
the
West
the
struggle
will
be
hard
indeed
''
.
The
handwriting
is
on_the_wall
.
The
only
hope
for
West_Berlin
lies_in
a
compromise
which
will
bring_down
the
wall
and
reunite
the
city
.
State_Department
officials
refusing
to
show
their
passes
at
the
boundary
,
and
driving
two
blocks
into
East_Berlin
under
military
escort
,
will
not
avail
.
Tanks
lined_up
at
the
border
will
be
no_more
helpful
.
The
materials
for
compromise
are
at_hand
:
The
Nation
,
Walter_Lippmann
and
other
sober
commentators
(
see
Alan_Clark
on
p.
367
)
have
spelled
them
out
again_and_again
.
A
compromise
will
leave
both
sides
without
the
glow
of
triumph
,
but
it
will
save
Berlin
.
Or
the
city
can
be
a
graveyard
monument
to
Western
intransigence
,
if
that
is
what
the
West
wants
.
The
removal
of
Stalin
's
body
from
the
mausoleum
he
shared
with
Lenin
to
less
distinguished
quarters
in
the
Kremlin
wall
is
not
unprecedented
in
history
.
It
is
,
in_fact
,
a
relatively
mild
chastisement
of
the
dead
.
A
British
writer
,
Richard_Haestier
,
in
a
book
,
Dead_Men_Tell_Tales
,
recalls
that
in
the
turmoil
preceding
French_Revolution
the
body
of
Henry_/4
,
,
who
had
died
nearly
180
years
earlier
,
was
torn
to
pieces
by
a
mob
.
And
in
England
,
after
the
Restoration
,
the
body
of
Cromwell
was
disinterred
and
hanged
at
Tyburn
.
The
head
was
then
fixed
on
a
pole
at
Westminster
,
and
the
rest
of
the
body
was
buried
under
the
gallows
.
Contemplating
these
posthumous
punishments
,
Stalin
should
not
lose
all
hope
.
In
1899
,
Parliament
erected
a
statue
to
Cromwell
in
Westminster
,
facing
Whitehall
and
there
,
presumably
,
he
still
stands
.
Nikita_Khrushchev
,
however
,
has
created
yet
another
problem
for
himself
.
The
Lenin
tomb
is
obviously
adequate
for
double
occupancy
,
Moscow
is
a
crowded
city
,
and
the
creed
of
communism
deplores
waste
.
Who
will
take
Stalin
's
place
beside
Lenin
?
There
is
Karl_Marx
,
of_course
,
buried
in
London
.
The
Macmillan
government
might
be
willing
to
let
him
go
,
but
he
has
been
dead
seventy-eight
years
and
even
the
Soviet
morticians
could
not
make
him
look
presentable
.
Who
,
then
,
is
of
sufficient
stature
to
lodge
with
Lenin
?
Who
but
Nikita
himself
?
Since
he
has
just
shown
who
is
top_dog
,
he
may
not
be
ready
to
receive
this
highest
honor
in
the
gift
of
the
Soviet
people
.
Besides
,
he
can
hardly
avoid
musing
on
the
instability
of
death
which
,
what
with
exhumations
and
rehabilitations
,
seems
to
match
that
of
life
.
Suppose
he
did
lie
beside
Lenin
,
would
it
be
permanent
?
If
some
future
Khrushchev
decided
to
rake_up
the
misdeeds
of
his
revered
predecessor
,
would
not
the
factory_workers
pass
the
same
resolutions
applauding
his
dispossession
?
When
a
man
is
laid_to_rest
,
he
is
entitled
to
stay_put
.
If
Nikita
buys
a
small
plot
in
some
modest
rural
cemetery
,
everyone
will
understand
.
The
appointment
of
U_Thant
of
Burma
as
the
U.N.'s
Acting
Secretary_General
-
at
this
writing
,
the
choice
appears
to
be
certain
-
offers
further
proof
that
in
politics
it
is
more
important
to
have
no
influential
enemies
than
to
have
influential
friends
.
Mongi_Slim
of
Tunisia
and
Frederick_Boland
of
Ireland
were
early
favorites
in_the_running
,
but
France
did
n't
like
the
former
and
the
Soviet_Union
would
have
none
of
the
latter
.
With
the
neutralists
maintaining
pressure
for
one
of
their
own
to
succeed
Mr._Hammarskjold
,
U_Thant
emerged
as
the
only
possible
candidate
unlikely
to
be
waylaid
by
a
veto
.
What
is
interesting
is
that
his
positive
qualifications
for
the
post
were
revealed
only
as
a
kind
of
tail
to
his
candidacy
.
In
all
the
bitter
in-fighting
,
the
squabbles
over
election
procedures
,
the
complicated
numbers_game
that
East
and
West
played
on
the
assistant
secretaries
'
theme
,
the
gentleman
from
Burma
showed
himself
both
as
a
man
of
principle
and
a
skilled
diplomat
.
He
has
,
moreover
,
another
qualification
which
augurs
well
for
the
future
.
He
is
a
Buddhist
,
which
means
that
to
him
peace
and
the
sanctity
of
human
life
are
not_only
religious
dogma
,
but
a
profound
and
unshakable
Weltanschauung
.
U_Thant
of_course
,
will
hold
office
until
the
spring
of
1963
,
when
Mr._Hammarskjold
's
term
would
have
come
to
an
end
.
Whether
the
compromises
-
on
both
sides
-
that
made_possible
the
interim
appointment
can
then
be
repeated
remains
to
be
seen
.
Mr._Khrushchev
's
demand
for
a
troika
is
dormant
,
not
dead
;
the
West
may
or
not
remain
satisfied
with
the
kind
of
neutralism
that
U_Thant
represents
.
In_a_sense
,
the
showdown
promised
by
Mr._Hammarskjold
's
sudden
and
tragic
death
has
been
avoided
;
no
precedents
have
been
set
as_yet
;
structurally
,
the
U.N.
is
still
fluid
,
vulnerable
to
the
pressures
that
its
new
and
enlarged
membership
are
bringing_to_bear
upon
it
.
But
at_least
the
pessimists
who
believed
that
the
world_organization
had
plunged
to
its
death
in
that
plane
crash
in
the
Congo
have
been
proved
wrong
.
No
one
who
has
studied
the
radical
Right
can
suppose
that
words
are
their
sole
staple
in
trade
.
These
are
mentalities
which
crave
action
-
and
they
are
beginning
to
get_it
,
as
Messrs._Salsich
and
Engh
report
on
page
372
.
Even
in
areas
where
political
connotations
are
(
deliberately
?
)
left
vague
,
the
spirit
of
vigilantism
is
spreading
.
Friends
,
a
picture
magazine
distributed
by
Chevrolet
dealers
,
describes
a
paramilitary_organization
of
employees
of
the
Gulf_Telephone_Company
at
Foley
,
Alabama
.
``
If
the
day
should
ever
come
that
foreign
invaders
swarm
ashore
along
the
Gulf_Coast
''
,
the
account
reads
,
``
they
can
count_on
heavy
opposition
from
a
group
of
commando
trained
telephone
employees
-
all
girls
.
Heavily
armed
and
mobilized
as
a
fast
moving
Civil_Defense
outfit
,
23
operators
and
office
personnel
stand
ready
to
move_into
action
at
a
minute
's
notice
''
.
According_to
Friends
,
the
unit
was
organized
by
John_Snook
,
a
former
World_War_/2
,
commando
who
is
vice_president
and
general_manager
of
the
telephone_company
.
The
girls
,
very
fetching
in
their
uniforms
,
are
shown
firing
rockets
from
a
launcher
mounted
on
a
dump_truck
;
they
are
also
trained
with
carbines
,
automatic
weapons
,
pistols
,
rifles
and
other
such
ladies
'
accessories
.
This
may
be
opera_bouffe
now
,
but
it
will
become
more
serious
should
the
cold_war
mount
in
frenzy
.
The
country
is
committed
to
the
doctrine
of
security
by
military
means
.
The
doctrine
has
never
worked
;
it
is
not
working
now
.
The
official
military
establishment
can
only
threaten
to
use
its
nuclear
arms
;
it
cannot
bring
them
into
actual
play
.
A
more
dangerous
formula
for
national
frustration
cannot
be
imagined
.
As
the
civic
temper
rises
,
the
more
naive
citizens
begin
to
play
soldier
-
but
the
guns
are
real
.
Soon
they
will
begin
to
hunt_down
the
traitors
they
are
assured
are
in
our
midst
.
