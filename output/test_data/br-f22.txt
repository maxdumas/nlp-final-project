In
Ireland
's
County_Limerick
,
near
the
River_Shannon
,
there
is
a
quiet
little
suburb
by
the
name
of
Garryowen
,
which
means
``
Garden
of
Owen
''
.
Undoubtedly
none
of
the
residents
realize
the
influence
their
town
has
had
on
American
military
history
,
or
the
deeds
of
valor
that
have
been
done
in
its
name
.
The
cry
``
Garryowen
''
!
bursting
from
the
lips
of
a
charging
cavalry
trooper
was
the
last
sound
heard
on
this
earth
by
untold
numbers
of
Cheyennes
,
Sioux
and
Apaches
,
Mexican
banditos
under
Pancho_Villa
,
Japanese
in
the
South_Pacific
,
and
Chinese
and
North_Korean
Communists
in
Korea
.
Garryowen
is
the
battle_cry
of
the
7_th_U._S._Cavalry_Regiment
,
``
The
Fighting_Seventh
''
.
Today
a
battle_cry
may
seem
an
anachronism
,
for
in
the
modern
Army
,
esprit_de_corps
has
been
sacrificed
to
organizational
charts
and
tables
.
But
do
n't
tell
that
to
a
veteran
of
the
Fighting_Seventh
,
especially
in
a
saloon
on
Saturday
night
.
Of
all
the
thousands
of
men
who
have
served
in
the
7_th_Cav
,
perhaps
no
one
knows
its
spirit
better
than
Lieutenant_Colonel_Melbourne_C._Chandler
.
Wiry
and
burr_headed
,
with
steel_blue
eyes
and
a
chest
splattered
with
medals
,
Chandler
is
the
epitome
of
the
old-time
trooper
.
The
truth
is
,
however
,
that
when
Mel_Chandler
first
reported
to
the
regiment
the
only
steed
he
had
ever
ridden
was
a
swivel_chair
and
the
only
weapon
he
had
ever
wielded
was
a
pencil
.
Chandler
had
been
commissioned
in
the
Medical_Service_Corps
and
was
serving
as
a
personnel
officer
for
the
Kansas_City_Medical_Depot
when
he
decided
that
if
he
was
going_to
make
the
Army
his
career
,
he
wanted
to
be
in
the
fighting
part
of
it
.
Though
he
knew
no
more
about
military
science
and
tactics
than
any
other
desk_officer
,
he
managed
to
get
transferred
to
the
combat
forces
.
The
next
thing
he
knew
he
was
reporting
for
duty
as
commanding_officer
of
Troop_H
,
7_th_Cavalry
,
in_the_middle
of
corps
maneuvers
in
Japan
.
Outside
of
combat
,
he
could
n't
have
landed
in
a
tougher
spot
.
First_of_all
,
no
unit
likes
to
have
a
new
CO
brought_in
from
the
outside
,
especially
when
he
's
an
armchair
trooper
.
Second
,
if
there
is
ever
a
perfect
time
to
pull_the_rug_out_from_under
him
,
it
's
on
maneuvers
.
In
combat
,
helping
your
CO
make
a
fool
of
himself
might
mean
getting
yourself
killed
.
But
in
maneuvers
,
with
the
top
brass
watching
him
all_the_time
,
it
's
easy
.
Chandler
understood
this
and
expected
the
worst
.
But
his
first
few
days
with
Troop_H
were
full
of
surprises
,
beginning
with
First_Sergeant_Robert_Early
.
Chandler
had
expected
a
tough
old
trooper
with
a
gravel
voice
.
Instead
Sergeant_Early
was
quiet
,
sharp
and
confident
.
He
had
enlisted
in
the
Army
straight
out
of
high_school
and
had
immediately
set_about
learning
his
new
trade
.
There
was
no
weapon
Early
could
not
take_apart
and
reassemble
blind-folded
.
He
could
lead
a
patrol
and
he
knew
his
paper_work
.
Further
,
he
had
taken
full
advantage
of
the
Army
's
correspondence_courses
.
He
not_only
knew
soldiering
,
but
mathematics
,
history
and
literature
as_well
.
But
for
all
his
erudite
confidence
,
Sergeant_Early
was
right
out
of
the
Garryowen
mold
.
He
was
filled
with
the
spirit
of
the
Fighting_Seventh
.
That
saved
Mel_Chandler
.
Sergeant_Early
let
the
new
CO
know
just
how
lucky
he
was
to
be
in
the
best
troop
in
the
best
regiment
in
the
United_States
Army
.
He
fed
the
captain
bits
of
history
about
the
troops
and
the
regiment
.
For_example
,
it
was
a
battalion
of
the
7_th_Cavalry
under
Colonel_George_Armstrong_Custer
that
had
been
wiped_out
at
the
Battle_of_The_Little_Big_Horn
.
It
did
n't
take
Captain_Chandler
long
to
realize
that
he
had
to
carry
a
heavy
load
of
tradition
on
his
shoulders
as
commander
of
Troop_H
.
But
what
made
the
load
lighter
was
the
realization
that
every
officer
,
non-com
and
trooper
was
ready
and
willing
to
help
him
carry
it
,
for
the
good
of
the
troop
and
the
regiment
.
Maneuvers
over
,
the
7_th
returned
to
garrison
duty
in
Tokyo
,
Captain_Chandler
still
with
them
.
It
was
the
7_th_Cavalry
whose
troopers
were
charged
with
guarding
the
Imperial_Palace_of_the_Emperor
.
But
still
Mel_Chandler
was
not
completely
convinced
that
men
would
really
die
for
a
four
syllable
word
,
``
Garryowen
''
.
The
final
proof
was
a
small
incident
.
It
happened
at
the
St._Patrick
's_Day
party
,
a
big
affair
for
a
regiment
which
had
gone_into
battle
for
over
three
quarters
of
a
century
to
the
strains
of
an
Irish
march
.
In_the_middle
of
the
party
Chandler
looked
up
to
see
four
smiling
faces
bearing_down
upon
him
,
each
beaming
above
the
biggest
,
greenest
shamrock
he
had
ever
seen
.
The
faces
belonged_to
Lieutenant_Marvin_Goulding
,
his
wife
and
their
two
children
.
And
when
the
singing
began
,
it
was
the
Gouldings
who
sang
the
old
Irish
songs
the
best
.
Though
there
was
an
occasional
good-natured
chuckle
about
Marvin_Goulding
,
the
Jewish
officer
from
Chicago
,
singing
tearfully
about
the
ould
sod
,
no_one
really
thought
it
was
strange
.
For
Marvin_Goulding
,
like
Giovanni_Martini
,
the
bugler
boy
who
carried
Custer
's
last
message
,
or
Margarito_Lopez
,
the
one-man
Army
on
Leyte
,
was
a
Garryowen
,
through
and
through
.
It
was
no
coincidence
that
Goulding
was
one
of
the
most
beloved
platoon
leaders
in
the
regiment
.
And
so
Mel_Chandler
got
the
spirit
of
Garryowen
.
He
set_out
to
keep
Troop_H
the
best
troop
in
the
best
regiment
.
One
of
his
innovations
was
to
see_to_it
that
every
man
-
cook
and
clerk
as_well_as
rifleman
-
qualified
with
every
weapon
in
the
troop
.
Even
the
mess
sergeant
,
Bill_Brown
,
a
dapper
,
cocky
transfer
from
an
airborne
division
,
went_out
on
the
range
.
The
troop
received
a
new
leader
,
Lieutenant_Robert_M._Carroll
,
fresh
out
of
ROTC
and
bucking
for
Regular_Army
status
.
Carroll
was
sharp
and
military
,
but
he
was
up
against
tough
competition
for
that
RA
berth
,
and
he
wanted
to
play
it
cool
.
So
Mel_Chandler
set_out
to
sell
him
on
the
spirit
of
Garryowen
,
just
as
he
himself
had
been
sold
a
short
time
before
.
When
the
Korean_war
began
,
on
June
25
,
1950
,
the
anniversary
of
the
day
Custer
had
gone_down
fighting
at
the
Little_Big_Horn
and
the
day
the
regiment
had
assaulted
the
beachhead
of
Leyte
during
World_War_2
,
,
the
7_th_Cavalry
was
not
in
the
best
fighting
condition
.
Its
entire
complement
of
non-commissioned
officers
on
the
platoon
level
had
departed
as
cadre
for
another
unit
,
and
its
vehicles
were
still
those
used
in
the
drive
across
Luzon
in
World_War_2
,
.
Just
a
month
after
the
Korean_War
broke_out
,
the
7_th_Cavalry
was
moving_into
the
lines
,
ready
for
combat
.
From
then
on
the
Fighting_Seventh
was
in
the
thick
of
the
bitterest
fighting
in
Korea
.
One
night
on
the
Naktong_River
,
Mel_Chandler
called_on
that
fabled
esprit_de_corps
.
The
regiment
was
dug_in
on
the
east_side
of
the
river
and
the
North_Koreans
were
steadily
building_up
a
concentration
of
crack
troops
on
the
other
side
.
The
troopers
knew
an
attack
was
coming
,
but
they
did
n't
know
when
,
and
they
did
n't
know
where
.
At
6_o_'_clock
on
the
morning
of
August
12
,
they
were
in
doubt
no_longer
.
Then
it
came
,
against
Troop_H
.
The
enemy
had
filtered
across
the
river
during
the
night
and
a
full
force
of
1000
men
,
armed
with
Russian
machine_guns
,
attacked
the
position
held
by
Chandler
's
men
.
They
came
in
waves
.
First
came
the
cannon_fodder
,
white
clad
civilians
being
driven
into
death
as
a
massive
human
battering_ram
.
They
were
followed
by
crack
North_Korean
troops
,
who
mounted
one
charge
after
another
.
They
overran
the
7_th_Cav
's
forward
machine-gun
positions
through
sheer
weight
of
numbers
,
over
piles
of_their_own
dead
.
Another
force
flanked
the
company
and
took_up
a
position
on
a
hill
to
the
rear
.
Captain_Chandler
saw
that
it
was
building_up
strength
.
He
assembled
a
group
of
25
men
,
composed
of
wounded
troopers
awaiting
evacuation
,
the
company
clerk
,
supply
men
,
cooks
and
drivers
,
and
led
them
to
the
hill
.
One
of
the
more
seriously
wounded
was
Lieutenant_Carroll
,
the
young
officer
bucking
for
the
Regular_Army
.
Chandler
left
Carroll
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
to
direct
any
reinforcements
he
could
find
to
the
fight
.
Then
Mel_Chandler
started
up
the
hill
.
He
took
one
step
,
two
,
broke_into
a
trot
and_then
into
a
run
.
The
first
thing
he
knew
the
words
``
Garryowen
''
!
burst
from
his
throat
.
His
followers
shouted
the
old
battle_cry
after
him
and
charged
the
hill
,
firing
as
they
ran
.
The
Koreans
fell_back
,
but
regrouped
at
the
top
of
the
hill
and
pinned
down
the
cavalrymen
with
a
screen
of
fire
.
Chandler
,
looking_to
right
and
left
to
see
how
his
men
were
faring
,
suddenly
saw
another
figure
bounding
up
the
hill
,
hurling
grenades
and
hollering
the
battle_cry
as
he
ran
.
It
was
Bob_Carroll
,
who
had
suddenly
found
himself
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
Garryowen
.
He
had
formed
his
own
task_force
of
three
stragglers
and
led
them
up
the
hill
in
a
Fighting_Seventh
charge
.
Because
of
this
diversionary_attack
the
main
group
that
had
been
pinned
down
on
the
hill
was
able
to
surge
forward
again
.
But
an
enemy
grenade
hit
Carroll
in
the
head
and
detonated
simultaneously
.
He
went_down
like
a
wet
rag
and
the
attackers
hit_the_dirt
in
the
face
of
the
withering
enemy
fire
.
Enemy
reinforcements
came
pouring
down
,
seeking
a
soft_spot
.
They
found
it
at
the
junction
between
Troops_H_and_G
,
and
prepared
to
counterattack
.
Marvin_Goulding
saw
what
was
happening
.
He
turned_to
his
platoon
.
``
Okay
,
men
''
,
he
said
.
``
Follow
me
''
.
Goulding
leaped
to
his
feet
and
started
forward
,
``
Garryowen
''
!
on
his
lips
,
his
men
following
.
But
the
bullets
whacked
home
before
he
finished
his
battle_cry
and
Marvin_Goulding
fell
dead
.
For
an
instant
his
men
hesitated
,
unable
to
believe
that
their
lieutenant
,
the
most
popular
officer
in
the
regiment
,
was
dead
.
Then
they
let_out
a
bellow
of
anguish
and
rage
and
,
cursing
,
screaming
and
hollering
``
Garryowen
''
!
they
charged
into
the
enemy
like
wild_men
.
That
finished
the
job
that
Captain_Chandler
and
Lieutenant_Carroll
had
begun
.
Goulding
's
platoon
pushed_back
the
enemy
soldiers
and
broke_up
the
timing
of
the
entire
enemy
attack
.
Reinforcements
came_up
quickly
to
take_advantage
of
the
opening
made
by
Goulding
's
platoon
.
The
North_Koreans
threw_away
their
guns
and
fled
across
the
rice_paddies
.
Artillery
and
air
strikes
were
called_in
to
kill
them
by
the
hundreds
.
Though
Bob_Carroll
seemed
to
have
had
his
head
practically
blown_off
by
the
exploding
grenade
,
he
lived
.
Today
he
is
a
major
-
in
the
Regular_Army
.
So
filled
was
Mel_Chandler
with
the
spirit
of
Garryowen
that
after
Korea
was
over
,
he
took_on
the
job
of
writing
the
complete
history
of
the
regiment
.
After
years
of
digging
,
nights
and
weekends
,
he
put_together
the
big
,
profusely
illustrated
book
,
Of_Garryowen_and_Glory
,
which
is
probably
the
most
complete
history
of
any
military_unit
.
The
battle
of
the
Naktong_River
is
just
one
example
of
how
the
battle_cry
and
the
spirit
of
The
Fighting_Seventh
have
paid_off
.
For
nearly
a
century
the
cry
has
never
failed
to
rally
the
fighting
men
of
the
regiment
.
Take
the
case
of
Major_Marcus_A._Reno
,
who
survived
the
Battle_of_The_Little_Big_Horn
in
1876
.
From
the
enlisted_men
he
pistol-whipped
to
the
subordinate
officer
whose
wife
he
tried
to
rape
,
a
lot
of
men
had
plenty
of
reason
heartily
to
dislike
Marcus_Reno
.
Many_of
his
fellow
officers
refused
to
speak_to
him
.
But
when
a
board
of
inquiry
was
called
to
look_into
the
charges
of
cowardice
made
against
him
,
the
men
who
had
seen
Reno
leave
the
battlefield
and
the
officer
who
had
heard
Reno
suggest
that
the
wounded
be
left
to
be
tortured
by
the
Sioux
,
refused
to
say
a
harsh
word
against
him
.
He
was
a
member
of
The
Fighting_Seventh
.
Although
it
was
at
the
Battle_of_The_Little_Horn
,
about
which
more
words
have
been
written
than
any
other
battle
in
American
history
,
that
the
7_th_Cavalry
first
made
its
mark
in
history
,
the
regiment
was
ten
years
old
by
then
.
Brevet_Major_General_George_Armstrong_Custer
was
the
regiment
's
first
permanent
commander
and
,
like
such
generals
as
George_S._Patton
and
Terry_de_la_Mesa_Allen
in
their
rise
to
military
prominence
,
Custer
was
a
believer
in
blood_and_guts
warfare
.
During
the
Civil_War
,
Custer
,
who
achieved
a
brilliant
record
,
was
made
brigadier_general
at
the
age
of
23
.
He
finished
the
war
as
a
major_general
,
commanding
a
full
division
,
and
at
25
was
the
youngest
major_general
in
the
history
of
the
U._S.
Army
.
