Cook
had
discovered
a
beef
in
his
possession
a_few
days
earlier
and
,
when
he
could
not
show
the
hide
,
arrested
him
.
Thinking
the
evidence
insufficient
to
get
a
conviction
,
he
later
released
him
.
Even
while
suffering
the
trip
to
his
home
,
Cook
swore
to
Moore
and
Lane
that
he
would
kill
the
Indian
.
Three
weeks
later
following
his
recovery
,
armed
with
a
writ
issued
by
the
Catskill
justice
on
affidavits
prepared
by
the
district_attorney
,
Cook
and
Russell
rode
to
arrest
Martinez
.
Arriving
at
daybreak
,
they
found
Julio
in
his
corral
and
demanded
that
he
surrender
.
Instead
,
he
whirled
and
ran
to
his
house
for
a
gun
forcing
them
to
kill
him
,
Cook
reported
.
Both
Cook
's
and
Russell
's
lives
were
threatened
by
the
Mexicans
following
the
killing
,
but
the
company
officers
felt
that
in_the_end
,
it
would
serve
to
quiet
them
despite
their
immediate
emotion
.
General_manager
Pels
even
suggested
that
it
might
be
wise
to
keep
the
Mexicans
in
suspense
rather_than
accept
their
offers
to
sell_out
and
move
away
,
and
try
to
have
a_few
punished
.
On
February
17
,
Russell
and
Cook
were
sent
to
the
Pena_Flor
community
on
the
Vermejo
to
see
about
renting_out
ranches
the
company
had
purchased
.
While
talking
with
Julian_M._Beall
,
Francisco_Archuleta
and
Juan_Marcus
appeared
,
both
heavily
armed
,
and
after
watching
the
house
for_a_while
,
rode_away
.
It
was
nearly
sundown
before
they
finished
the
business
with
Beall
and
began
riding
down
the
stream
.
They
had
traveled
only
a
short
distance
when
they
spotted
five
Mexicans
riding
along
a
horse-trail
across
the
stream
just
ahead
of
them
.
Suspecting
an
ambush
,
the
two
deputies
decided
to
ride
up
a
side
canyon
taking
a
short_cut
into
Catskill
.
After
spending
two
nights
(
Wednesday
and
Thursday
)
in
Catskill
,
the
deputies
again
headed
for
the
Vermejo
to
finish
their
business
.
They
stayed
with
a
rancher
Friday
night
and
by
eleven
o'clock
Saturday
morning
passed
the
old
Garnett_Lee
ranch
.
Half
a
mile
below
at
the
mouth
of
Salyer_'s_Canyon
was
an
old
ranch
that
the
company
had
purchased
from
A._J._Armstrong
,
occupied
by
a
Mexican
,
his
wife
,
and
an
old
trapper
.
There
were
three
houses
in
Salyer_'s_Canyon
just
at
the
foot
of
a
low
bluff
,
the
road
winding
along
the
top
,
entering
above
,
and_then
passing
down
in_front_of
the
houses
,
thence
to
the
Vermejo
.
To
the
west
of
this
road
was
another
low
bluff
,
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
,
covered
with
scrub_oak
and
other
brush
.
As
they
were
riding
along
this
winding
road
on
the
bench
of
land
between
the
two
bluffs
,
a
volley
of
rifle
fire
suddenly
crashed
around
the
two
officers
.
Not
a
bullet
touched
Cook
who
was
nearer
the
ambush
,
but
one
hit
Russell
in
the
leg
and
another
broke
his
arm
,
passing_on
through
his
body
.
With
the
first
reports
,
Russell
's
horse
wheeled
to
the
right
and
ran
towards
the
buildings
while
Cook
,
followed
by
a
hail
of
bullets
,
raced
towards
the
arroyo
of
Salyer_'s_Canyon
immediately
in_front_of
him
,
just
reaching
it
as
his
horse
fell
.
Grabbing
his
Winchester
from
its
sheath
,
Cook
prepared
to
fight
from
behind
the
arroyo
bank
.
Bullets
were
so
thick
,
throwing
sand
in
his
face
,
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
return
the
fire
.
Noticing
Russell
's
horse
in_front_of
the
long
log
building
,
he
assumed
his
friend
had
slipped
inside
and
would
be
able
to
put_up
a
good
fight
,
so
he
began
working
his
way
down
the
ditch
to
join
him
.
At
a
very
shallow
place
,
two
Mexicans
rushed
into
the
open
for
a
shot
.
Dropping
to
one
knee
,
Cook
felled
one
,
and
the
other
struggled
off
with
his
comrade
,
sending
no
further
fire
in
his
direction
.
Just
before
leaving
the
arroyo
where
he
was
partially
concealed
,
he
did
hear
shots
down
at
the
house
.
Russell
had
reached
the
house
as
Cook
surmised
,
dismounted
,
but
just
as
the
old
trapper
opened
the
door
to
receive
him
,
he
fell
into
the
trapper
's
arms
-
dead
.
A
bullet
fired
by
one
of
the
Mexicans
hiding
in
a
little
chicken
house
had
passed_through
his
head
,
tearing
a
hole
two
inches
square
on
the
outgoing
side
.
Finding
him
dead
,
Cook
caught
Russell
's
horse
and
rode
to
the
cattle
foreman
's
house
to
report
the
incident
and
request
bloodhounds
to
trail
the
assassins
.
Before
daylight
Sunday
morning
,
a
posse
of
twenty-three
men
under
the
leadership
of
Deputy_Sheriff_Frank_MacPherson
of
Catskill
followed
the
trail
to
the
house
of
Francisco_Chaves
,
where
100
to
150
Mexicans
had
gathered
.
MacPherson
boldly
approached
the
fortified
adobe_house
and
demanded
entrance
.
The
men
inside
informed
him
that
they
had
some
wounded
men
among
them
but
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
see
them
even_though
he
offered
medical_aid
.
The
officer
demanded
the
names
of
the
injured
men
;
the
Mexicans
not_only
refused
to
give
them
,
but
told
the
possemen
if
they
wanted
a
fight
they
could
have
it
.
Since
the
strength
of
the
Mexicans
had
been
underrated
,
too
small
a
posse
had
been
collected
,
and
since
the
deputy
had
not
been
provided
with
search_warrants
,
MacPherson
and
his
men
decided
it
was
much
wiser
to
withdraw
.
The
posse
's
retreat
encouraged
the
Mexicans
to
be
overbearing
and
impudent
.
During
the
following
week
,
six
tons
of
hay
belonging
to
one
rancher
were
burned
;
some
buildings
,
farm
tools
,
two
horses
,
plows
,
and
hay
owned
by
Bonito_Lavato
,
a
friendly
interpreter
for
the
company
,
and
Pedro_Chavez
'
hay
were
stolen
or
destroyed
;
and
a
store
was
broken
into
and
robbed
.
District_Attorney
M._W._Mills
warned
that
he
would
vigorously
prosecute
persons
caught
committing
these
crimes
or
carrying
arms
-
he
just
did
n't
catch
anyone
.
Increasing
threats
on
his
life
finally
convinced
Cook
that
he
should
leave
New_Mexico
.
His
friends
advised
that
it
would
be
only
a
question
of
time
until
either
the
Mexicans
killed
him
by
ambuscade
or
he
would
be
compelled
to
kill
them
in
self-defense
,
perpetuating
the
troubles
.
By
early
summer
,
he
wrote
from
Laramie
that
he
was
suffering
from
the
wound
inflicted
in
the
ambush
and
was
in_a_bad_way
financially
,
so
Pels
sent
him
a
draft
for
$
100
,
warning
that
it
was
still
not
wise
for
him
to
return
.
Pels
also
sent
a
check
for
$
100
to
Russell
's
widow
and
had
a
white
marble
monument
erected
on
his
grave
.
Cattle
stealing
and
killing
,
again
serious
during
the
spring
of
1891
,
placed
the
land_grant
company
officers
in
a
perplexing
position
.
They
were
reluctant
to
appoint
sheriffs
to
protect
the
property
,
thus
running_the_risk
of
creating
disturbances
such_as
that
on
the
Vermejo
,
and
yet
the
cowboys
protested
that
they
got
no
salary
for
arresting
cattle_thieves
and
running_the_risk
of
being
shot
.
And
the
law
virtually
ignored
the
situation
.
The
judge
became
ill
just
as
the
Colfax_District_Court
convened
,
no
substitute
was
brought_in
,
no
criminal
cases
heard
,
only
5
out
of
122
cases
docketed
were
tried
,
and
court
adjourned
sine_die
after
sitting
a_few
days
instead_of
the
usual
three
weeks
.
Pels
complained
:
``
Litigants
and
witnesses
were
put
to
the
expense
and
inconvenience
of
going
long
distances
to
transact
business
;
public
money
spent
;
justice
delayed
;
nothing
accomplished
,
and
the
whole
distribution
of
justice
in
this
county
seems
to
be
an
absolute
farce
''
.
Word
reached
the
company
that
the
man
behind
these
depredations
was
Manuel_Gonzales
,
a
man
with
many
followers
,
including
a
number
who
were
kept
in
line
through
fear
of
him
.
Although
wanted
by
the
sheriff
for
killing
an
old_man
named
Asher_Jones
,
the
warrant
for
his
arrest
had
never
been
served
.
On
May
19
,
a
deputy_sheriff
's
posse
of
eight
men
left
Maxwell_City
and
rode
thirty-five
miles
up
the
Vermejo
where
they
were
joined
by
Juan_Jose_Martinez
.
By
3
:
00
A.M.
they
reached
his
house
and
found
it
vacant
.
When
they
were
refused
entrance
to
his
brother
's
house
nearby
,
they
smashed
down
the
door
,
broke
the
window
,
and
threw
lighted
clothes
wet
with
kerosene
into
the
room
.
Still
there
was
no
Gonzales
and
the
family
would
say
nothing
.
About
300
yards
up
the
creek
was
a
cluster
of
Mexican
houses
containing
six
rooms
in
the
form
of
a
square
.
While
prowling
around
these
buildings
,
two
of
the
posse
recognized
the
voice
of
Gonzales
speaking_to
the
people
inside
.
He
was
promised
that
no
harm
would
befall
him
if
he
would
come_out
,
but
he
cursed
and
replied
that
he
would
shoot
any
man
coming_near
the
door
.
The
posse
then
asked
that
he
send_out
the
women
and
children
as
the
building
would
be
fired
or
torn_down
over
his
head
if
necessary
to
take
him
dead
or
alive
.
Again
he
refused
.
In
deadly
earnest
,
the
besiegers
methodically
stripped
away
portions
of
the
roof
and
tossed
lighted
rags
inside
,
only
to
have
most
stamped_out
by
the
women
as_soon_as
they
hit
the
floor
.
When
it
became
obvious
that
he
could
stay
inside
no_longer
,
taking
a_thousand
to
one
chance
Gonzales
rushed
outside
,
square
against
the
muzzle
of
a
Winchester
.
Shot
near
the
heart
,
he
turned
to
one
side
and
plunged
for
a
door
to
another
room
several
feet
away
,
three
bullets
following
him
.
As
he
pushed
open
the
door
he
fell
on
his
face
,
one
of
his
comrades
pulling
him
inside
.
Not
realizing
the
seriousness
of
the
wound
,
the
besiegers
warned
that
if
he
did
not
surrender
the
house
would
be
burned_down
around
him
.
Receiving
no
answer
,
they
set
the
fire
.
When
the
house
was
about
half
consumed
,
his
comrade
ran
to
the
door
and
threw
up
his
hands
,
declaring
repeatedly
that
he
did
not
know
the
whereabouts
of
Manuel
.
Finding
it
true
that
he
was
not
inside
,
the
deputies
returned
to
the
first
house
and
tore
holes
through
the
side
and
the
roof
until
they
could
see
a
body
on
the
bed
covered
by
a
blanket
.
Several
slugs
fired
into
the
bed
jerked
aside
the
blanket
to
reveal
an
apparently
lifeless
hand
.
Shot
six
or
eight
times
the
body
was
draped
with
Russell
's
pistol
,
belt
,
and
cartridges
.
There
was
no
extra
horse
so
it
was
left
to
his
comrades
who
,
though
numbering
in
the
fifties
,
had
stood
around
on
the
hillside
nearby
without
firing
a
shot
during
the
entire
attack
.
Early
the
next
morning
,
a
Mexican
telephoned
Pels
that
Celso_Chavez
,
one
of
the
posse
members
,
was
surrounded
by
ten
Mexicans
at
his
father
's
home
on
the
upper
Vermejo
.
The
sheriff
and
District_Attorney_Mills
hastily
swore_out
a
number
of
warrants
against
men
who
had
been
riding
about
armed
,
according_to
signed
statements
by
Chavez
and
Dr._I._P._George
,
and
ordered
Deputy_Barney_Clark
of
Raton
to
rescue
the
posseman
.
Traveling
all
night
,
Clark
and
twelve
men
arrived
at
about
seven
o'clock
May
22
.
Occasionally
they
heard
gun-shot
signals
and
a
number
of
horsemen
were
sighted
on
the
hills
,
disappearing
at
the
posse
's
approach
.
A
Mexican
justice_of_the_peace
had
issue
a
writ
against
Chavez
for
taking_part
in
the
``
murder
''
of
Manuel_Gonzales
so
he
and
his
father
were
anxious
to
be
taken_out
of
danger
.
The
men
helped
them
gather
their
belongings
and
escorted
them
to
Raton
along
with
three
other
families
desiring
to
leave
.
The
ten
or
more
dangerous
parties
singled_out
for
prosecution
were
still
at_large
,
and
Pels
realized
that
if
these
men
entrenched
themselves
in
their
adobe_houses
,
defending
themselves
through
loopholes
,
it
would
be
most
difficult
to
capture
them
.
Thus
he
wired
J._P._Lower_and_Sons
of
Denver
:
``
Have
you
any
percussion
hand_grenades
for
throwing
in
a
house
or
across
a
well
loaded
with
balls
or
shrapnel
shot
?
If_not
,
how
long
to
order
and
what
is
the
price
''
?
He
wisely
decided
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
create
a
disturbance
during
the
coming
roundup
,
particularly
since
the
Mexicans
were
on
their
guard
.
His
problem
then
became
one
of
restraining
the
American
fighters
who
wanted
to
clean_out
the
Vermejo
by
force
immediately
.
