In
a_few
school
districts
one
finds
a
link
between
school
and
job
.
In
those
vocational_programs
organized
with
Smith-Hughes
money
,
there
may
be
a
close
tie
between
the
labor_union
and
a
local
employer
on_the_one_hand
and
the
vocational
teacher
on
the
other
.
In
these
cases
a
graduate
may
enter
directly
into
an
apprentice
program
,
saving
a
year
because
of
his
vocational
courses
in
grades
11
and
12
.
The
apprentice
program
will
involve
further
education
on
a
part-time
basis
,
usually
at
night
,
perhaps
using
some
of
the
same
equipment
of
the
high_school
.
These
opportunities
are
to
be
found
in
certain
cities
in
such
crafts
as
auto_mechanics
,
carpentry
,
drafting
,
electrical_work
,
tool-and-die_work
,
and
sheet-metal
work
.
Formally
organized
vocational_programs
supported
by
federal
funds
allow
high_school
students
to
gain
experience
in
a
field
of
work
which
is
likely
to
lead
to
a
full-time
job
on
graduation
.
The
``
diversified
occupations
''
program
is
a
part-time
trade
preparatory
program
conducted
over
two
school_years
on
a
cooperative
basis
between
the
school
and
local
industrial
and
business
employers
.
The
``
distributive
education
''
program
operates
in_a_similar_way
,
with
arrangements
between
the
school
and
employers
in
merchandising
fields
.
In
both
cases
the
student
attends
school
half-time
and
works
in
a
regular
job
the
other
half
.
He
receives
remuneration
for
his
work
.
In
a_few
places
cooperative
programs
between
schools
and
employers
in
clerical
work
have
shown
the
same
possibilities
for
allowing
the
student
,
while
still
in
school
,
to
develop
skills
which
are
immediately
marketable
upon
graduation
.
Adult_education
courses
,
work-study_programs
of
various
sorts
-
these
are
all
evidence
of
a
continuing
interest
of
the
schools
in
furthering
educational
opportunities
for
out-of-school
youth
.
In_general
,
however
,
it
may
be
said
that
when
a
boy
or
a
girl
leaves
the
high_school
,
the
school
authorities
play
little
or
no
part
in
the
decision
of
what
happens
next
.
If
the
student
drops_out
of
high_school
,
the
break
with
the
school
is
even
more
complete
.
When
there
is
employment
opportunity
for
youth
,
this
arrangement
-
or
lack
of
arrangement
-
works_out
quite
well
.
Indeed
,
in
some
periods
of
our
history
and
in
some
neighborhoods
the
job
opportunities
have
been
so
good
that
undoubtedly
a
great
many
boys
who
were
potential
members
of
the
professions
quit
school
at
an
early
age
and
went
to
work
.
Statistically
this
has
represented
a
loss
to
the
nation
,
although
one
must
admit
that
in
an
individual
case
the
decision
in
retrospect
may
have
been
a
wise
one
.
I
make
no
attempt
to
measure
the
enduring
satisfaction
and
material
well-being
of
a
man
who
went
to
work
on
graduation
from
high_school
and
was
highly
successful
in
the
business
which
he
entered
.
He
may
or
may_not
be
``
better_off
''
than
his
classmate
who
went_on
to
a
college
and
professional
school
.
But
in
the
next
decades
the
nation
needs_to
educate
for
the
professions
all
the
potential
professional
talent
.
In
a
later
chapter
dealing
with
the
suburban
school
,
I
shall
discuss
the
importance
of
arranging
a
program
for
the
academically
talented
and
highly
gifted
youth
in
any
high_school
where
he
is
found
.
In
the
Negro
neighborhoods
and
also
to
some
extent
in
the
mixed
neighborhoods
the
problem
may
be
one
of
identification
and
motivation
.
High
motivation
towards
higher_education
must
start
early
enough
so_that
by
the
time
the
boy
or
girl
reaches
grade
9
he
or
she
has
at_least
developed
those
basic
skills
which
are
essential
for
academic
work
.
Undoubtedly
far
more
can
be
done
in
the
lower
grades
in
this
regard
in
the
Negro
schools
.
However
,
the
teacher
can
only
go
so
far
if
the
attitude
of
the
community
and
the
family
is
anti-intellectual
.
And
the
fact
remains
that
there
are
today
few
shining
examples
of
Negroes
in
positions
of
intellectual
leadership
.
This
is
not
due_to
any
policy
of
discrimination
on_the_part_of
the
Northern
universities
.
Quite
the
contrary
,
as
I
can
testify
from
personal
experience
as
a
former
university
president
.
Rather
we
see
here
another
vicious_circle
.
The
absence
of
successful
Negroes
in
the
world
of
scholarship
and
science
has
tended
to
tamp_down
enthusiasm
among
Negro
youth
for
academic
careers
.
I
believe
the
situation
is
improving
,
but
the
success
stories
need_to
be
heavily
publicized
.
Here
again
we
run_into
the
roadblock
that
Negroes
do
not
like
to
be
designated
as
Negroes
in
the
press
.
How
can
the
vicious_circle
be
broken
?
This
is
a
problem
to
which
leaders
of
opinion
,
both
Negro
and
white
,
should
devote
far
more
attention
.
It
is
at_least
as
important
as
the
more
dramatic
attempts
to
break_down
barriers
of
inequality
in
the
South
.
I
should_like
to
underline
four
points
I
made
in
my
first
report
with
respect_to
vocational
education
.
First_and_foremost
,
vocational
courses
should
not
replace
courses
which
are
essential
parts
of
the
required
academic_program
for
graduation
.
Second
,
vocational
courses
should
be
provided
in
grades
11
and
12
and
not
require
more_than
half
the
student
's
time
in
those
years
;
however
,
for
slow
learners
and
prospective
dropouts
these
courses
ought_to
begin
earlier
.
Third
,
the
significance
of
the
vocational
courses
is
that
those
enrolled
are
keenly
interested
in
the
work
;
they
realize
the
relevance
of
what
they
are
learning
to
their
future
careers
,
and
this
sense
of
purpose
is
carried_over
to
the
academic
courses
which
they
are
studying
at_the_same_time
.
Fourth
,
the
type
of
vocational
training_programs
should
be
related
to
the
employment
opportunities
in
the
general
locality
.
This
last
point
is
important
because
if
high_school
pupils
are
aware
that
few
,
if
any
,
graduates
who
have
chosen
a
certain
vocational_program
have
obtained
a
job
as
a
consequence
of
the
training
,
the
whole
idea
of
relevance
disappears
.
Vocational
training
which
holds
no
hope
that
the
skill
developed
will
be
in_fact
a
marketable
skill
becomes
just
another
school
``
chore
''
for
those
whose
interest
in
their
studies
has
begun
to
falter
.
Those
who
,
because
of
population
mobility
and
the
reputed
desire
of
employers
to
train
their
own
employees
,
would
limit
vocational
education
to
general
rather_than
specific
skills
ought_to
bear_in_mind
the
importance
of
motivation
in
any
kind
of
school
experience
.
I
have
been
using
the
word
``
vocational
''
as
a
layman
would
at_first_sight
think
it
should
be
used
.
I
intend
to
include
under
the
term
all
the
practical
courses
open
to
boys
and
girls
.
These
courses
develop
skills
other_than
those
we
think_of
when
we
use
the
adjective
``
academic
''
.
Practically
all_of
these
practical
skills
are
of
such
a
nature
that
a
degree
of
mastery
can
be
obtained
in
high_school
sufficient
to
enable
the
youth
to
get
a
job
at_once
on
the
basis
of
the
skill
.
They
are
in
this
sense
skills
marketable
immediately
on
graduation
from
high_school
.
To_be_sure
,
in
tool-and-die_work
and
in
the
building
trades
,
the
first
job
must
be
often
on
an
apprentice
basis
,
but
two
years
of
halftime
vocational
training
enables
the
young
man
thus
to
anticipate
one
year
of
apprentice
status
.
Similarly
,
a
girl
who
graduates
with
a
good
working
knowledge
of
stenography
and
the
use
of
clerical
machines
and
who
is
able
to
get
a
job
at_once
may
wish
to
improve
her
skill
and
knowledge
by
a
year
or
two
of
further
study
in
a
community_college
or
secretarial_school
.
Of_course
,
it
can
be
argued
that
an
ability
to
write
English
correctly
and
with
some
degree
of
elegance
is
a
marketable
skill
.
So
,
too
,
is
the
mathematical
competence
of
a
college
graduate
who
has
majored
in
mathematics
.
In_a_sense
almost
all
high_school
and
college
courses
could
be
considered
as
vocational
to
the
extent
that
later
in
life
the
student
in
his
vocation
(
which
may
be
a
profession
)
will
be
called_upon
to
use
some
of
the
skills
developed
and
the
competence
obtained
.
In_spite_of
the
shading
of
one
type
of
course
into
another
,
I
believe
it
is
useful
to
talk_about
vocational
courses
as
apart
from
academic
courses
.
Perhaps
a
course
in
typewriting
might
be
regarded_as
the
exception
which
proves
the
rule
.
Today
many
college
bound
students
try
to
take
a
course
in
personal
typing
,
as
they
feel
a
certain
degree
of
mastery
of
this
skill
is
almost
essential
for
one
who
proposes
to
do
academic
work
in
college
and
a
professional
school
.
Most_of
our
largest
cities
have
one
or
more
separate
vocational
or
technical
high_schools
.
In
this
respect
,
public
education
in
the
large
cities
differs
from
education
in
the
smaller
cities
and
consolidated
school
districts
.
The
neighborhood
high_schools
are
not
,
strictly_speaking
,
comprehensive
schools
,
because
some
of
the
boys
and
girls
may
be
attending
a
vocational
or
technical
high_school
instead
of
the
local
school
.
Indeed
,
one
school_superintendent
in
a
large
city
objects
to
the
use
of
the
term
comprehensive
high_school
for
the
senior_high_schools
in
his
city
,
because
these
schools
do
not
offer
strictly
vocational_programs
.
He
prefers
to
designate
such
schools
as
``
general
''
high_schools
.
The
suburban
high_school
,
it
is
worth
noting
,
also
is
not
a
widely
comprehensive
high_school
because
of
the
absence
of
vocational_programs
.
The
reason
is
that
there
is
a
lack
of
interest
on
the
part
of
the
community
.
Therefore
employment
and
education
in
all
the
schools
in
a
metropolitan
area
are
related
in
different
ways
from
those
which
are
characteristic
of
the
comprehensive
high_school
described
in
my
first
report
.
The
separate
vocational
or
technical
high_schools
in
the
large
cities
must
be
reckoned
as
permanent
institutions
.
By_and_large
their
programs
are
satisfactorily
connected
both
to
the
employment
situation
and
to
the
realities
of
the
apprentice
system
.
It
is
not
often
realized
to_what_degree
certain
trades
are
in
many
communities
closed
areas
of
employment
,
except
for
a
lucky
few
.
One
has_to
talk
confidentially
with
some
of
the
directors
of
vocational
high_schools
to
realize
that
a
boy
cannot
just
say
,
``
I
want
to
be
a
plumber
''
,
and
then
,
by
doing
good
work
,
find
a
job
.
It
is
far
more
difficult
in
many
communities
to
obtain
admission
to
an
apprentice
program
which
involves
union
approval
than
to
get_into
the
most
selective
medical_school
in
the
nation
.
Two
stories
will
illustrate
what
I
have_in_mind
.
One
vocational
instructor
in
a
city
vocational_school
,
speaking
of
his
course
in
a
certain
field
,
said
he
had
no
difficulty
placing
all
students
in
jobs
outside
of
the
city
.
In
the
city
,
he
said
,
the
waiting_list
for
those
who
want
to
join
the
union
is
so
long
that
unless
a
boy
has
an
inside_track
he
can
n't
get_in
.
In
a
far
distant
part
of
the
United_States
,
I
was
talking
to
an
instructor
about
a
boy
who
in
the
twelfth
grade
was
doing
special
work
.
``
What
does
he
have_in_mind
to
do
when
he
graduates
''
?
``
Oh
,
he
'll
be
a
plumber
''
,
came
the
answer
.
``
But
is
n't
it
almost
impossible
to
get_into
the
union
''
?
I
asked
.
``
He
'll
have
no
difficulty
''
,
I
was
told
.
``
He
has
very
good
connections
''
.
In
my
view
,
there
should
be
a
school
which
offers
significant
vocational_programs
for
boys
within
easy
reach
of
every
family
in
a
city
.
Ideally
these
schools
should
be
so
located
that
one
or
more
should
be
in
the
area
where
demand
for
practical
courses
is
at
the
highest
.
An
excellent
example
of
a
successful
location
of
a
new
vocational
high_school
is
the
Dunbar_Vocational_High_School
in
Chicago
.
Located
in
a
bad
slum_area
now
undergoing
redevelopment
,
this
school
and
its
program
are
especially
tailored
to
the
vocational
aims
of
its
students
.
Hardly_a
window
has
been
broken
since
Dunbar
first
was
opened
(
and
vandalism
in
schools
is
a
major
problem
in
many
slum_areas
)
.
I
discovered
in
the
course
of
a
visit
there
that
almost
all
the
pupils
were
Negroes
.
They
were
learning
trades
as
diverse
as
shoe_repairing
,
bricklaying
,
carpentry
,
cabinet
making
,
auto_mechanics
,
and
airplane_mechanics
.
The
physical
facilities
at
Dunbar
are
impressive
,
but
more
impressive
is
the
attitude
of
the
pupils
.
