Today
the
private_detective
will
also
investigate
insurance_claims
or
handle
divorce
cases
,
but
his
primary
function
remains
what
it
has
always
been
,
to
assist
those
who
have
money
in
their
unending
struggle
with
those
who
have
not
.
It
is
from
this
unpromising
background
that
the
fictional
private_detective
was
recruited
.
The
mythological
private_eye
differs
from
his
counterpart
in
real
life
in
two
essential
ways
.
On_the_one_hand
,
he
does
not
work
for
a
large
agency
,
but
is
almost
always
self-employed
.
As
a
free-lance
investigator
,
the
fictional
detective
is
responsible
to
no
one
but
himself
and
his
client
.
For
this
reason
,
he
appears
as
an
independent
and
self-reliant
figure
,
whose
rugged
individualism
need
not
be
pressed
into
the
mold
of
a
9
to
5
routine
.
On_the_other_hand
,
the
fictional
detective
does
not
break
strikes
or
handle
divorce
cases
;
no
client
would
ever
think_of
asking
him
to
do
such
things
.
Whatever
his
original
assignment
,
the
fictional
private_eye
ends_up
by
investigating
and
solving
a
crime
,
usually
a
murder
.
Operating
as
a
one_man
police_force
in
fact
if
not
in_name
,
he
is
at_once
more
independent
and
more
dedicated
than
the
police
themselves
.
He
catches
criminals
not
merely
because
he
is
paid
to
do
so
(
frequently
he
does
not
receive
a
fee
at_all
)
,
but
because
he
enjoys
his
work
,
because
he
firmly
believes
that
murder
must
be
punished
.
Thus
the
fictional
detective
is
much
more_than
a
simple
businessman
.
He
is
,
first_and_foremost
,
a
defender
of
public
morals
,
a
servant
of
society
.
It
is
this
curious
blend
of
rugged
individualism
and
public
service
which
accounts_for
the
great
appeal
of
the
mythological
detective
.
By_virtue_of
his
self-reliance
,
his
individualism
and
his
freedom
from
external
restraint
,
the
private_eye
is
a
perfect
embodiment
of
the
middle_class
conception
of
liberty
,
which
amounts
to
doing
what
you
please
and
let_the_devil_take_the_hindmost
.
At_the_same_time
,
because
the
personal
code
of
the
detective
coincides
with
the
legal
dictates
of
his
society
,
because
he
likes
to
catch
criminals
,
he
is
in
middle_class
eyes
a
virtuous
man
.
In
this
way
,
the
private_detective
gets
the
best
of
two
possible
worlds
.
He
is
an
individualist
but
not
an
anarchist
;
he
is
a
public
servant
but
not
a
cop
.
In_short
,
the
fictional
private_eye
is
a
specialized
version
of
Adam_Smith
's
ideal
entrepreneur
,
the
man
whose
private
ambitions
must
always
and
everywhere
promote
the
public
welfare
.
In
the
mystery_story
,
as
in
The_Wealth_of_Nations
,
individualism
and
the
social
good
are
two
sides
of
the
same
benevolent
coin
.
There
is
only
one
catch
to
this
idyllic
arrangement
:
Adam_Smith
was
wrong
.
Not_only
did
the
ideal
entrepreneur
not
produce
the
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number
,
he
ended
by
destroying
himself
,
by
giving
birth
to
monopoly
capitalism
.
The
rise
of
the
giant
corporations
in
Western
Europe
and
the
United_States
dates_from
the
period
1880
-
1900
.
Now
,
although
the
roots
of
the
mystery_story
in
serious
literature
go_back
as
far
as
Balzac
,
Dickens
,
and
Poe
,
it
was
not
until
the
closing
decades
of
the
19_th
century
that
the
private_detective
became
an
established
figure
in
popular
fiction
.
Sherlock_Holmes
,
the
ancestor
of
all
private_eyes
,
was
born
during
the
1890
s
.
Thus
the
transformation
of
Adam_Smith
's
ideal
entrepreneur
into
a
mythological
detective
coincides
closely
with
the
decline
of
the
real
entrepreneur
in
economic
life
.
Driven
from
the
marketplace
by
the
course
of
history
,
our
hero
disguises
himself
as
a
private_detective
.
The
birth
of
the
myth
compensates
for
the
death
of
the
ideal
.
Even
on
the
fictional
level
,
however
,
the
contradictions
which
give_rise
to
the
mystery_story
are
not
fully
resolved
.
The
individualism
and
public
service
of
the
private_detective
both
stem
from
his
dedication
to
a
personal
code_of_conduct
:
he
enforces
the
law
without
being
told
to
do
so
.
The
private_eye
is
therefore
a
moral
man
;
but
his
morality
rests
upon
that
of
his
society
.
The
basic
premise
of
all
mystery_stories
is
that
the
distinction
between
good
and
bad
coincides
with
the
distinction
between
legal
and
illegal
.
Unfortunately
,
this
assumption
does
not
always
hold
good
.
As
capitalism
in
the
20_th
century
has
become
increasingly
dependent
upon
force
and
violence
for
its
survival
,
the
private_detective
is
placed
in
a
serious
dilemma
.
If
he
is
good
,
he
may
not
be
legal
;
if
he
is
legal
,
he
may
not
be
good
.
It
is
the
gradual
unfolding
and
deepening
of_this
contradiction
which
creates
the
inner
dialectic
of
the
evolution
of
the
mystery_story
.
With
the
advent
of
Sir_Arthur_Conan_Doyle
's
Sherlock_Holmes
,
the
development
of
the
modern
private_detective
begins
.
Sherlock_Holmes
is
not
merely
an
individualist
;
he
is
very
close
to
being
a
mental_case
.
A
brief
list
of
the
great
detective
's
little
idiosyncrasies
would
provide
Dr._Freud
with
ample
food_for_thought
.
Holmes
is
addicted
to
the
use
of
cocaine
and
other
refreshing
stimulants
;
he
is
prone
to
semi
catatonic
trances
induced
by
the
playing
of
the
vioiln
;
he
is
a
recluse
,
an
incredible
egotist
,
a
confirmed
misogynist
.
Holmes
rebels
against
the
social
conventions
of
his
day
not
on
moral
but
rather
on
aesthetic
grounds
.
His
eccentricity
begins
as
a
defense
against
boredom
.
It
was
in_order
to
avoid
the
stuffy
routine
of
middle_class
life
that
Holmes
became
a
detective
in_the_first_place
.
As
he
informs
Watson
,
``
My
life
is
spent
in
one
long
effort
to
escape_from
the
commonplaces
of
existence
.
These
little
problems
help
me
to
do
so
''
.
Holmes
is
a
public
servant
,
to_be_sure
;
but
the
society
which
he
serves
bores
him
to
tears
.
The
curious
relationship
between
Holmes
and
Scotland_Yard
provides
an
important
clue
to
the
deeper
significance
of
his
eccentric
behavior
.
Although
he
is
perfectly
willing
to
cooperate
with
Scotland_Yard
,
Holmes
has
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
intelligence
and
mentality
of
the
police
.
They
for
their
part
are
convinced
that
Holmes
is
too
``
unorthodox
''
and
``
theoretical
''
to
make
a
good
detective
.
Why
do
the
police
find
Holmes
``
unorthodox
''
?
On_the_face_of_it
,
it
is
because
he
employs
deductive
techniques
alien
to
official
police
routine
.
Another
,
more
interesting
explanation
,
is
hinted
at
by
Watson
when
he
observes
on
several
occasions
that
Holmes
would
have
made
a
magnificent
criminal
.
The
great
detective
modestly
agrees
.
Watson
's
insight
is
verified
by
the
mysterious
link
between
Holmes
and
his
arch
opponent
,
Dr._Moriarty
.
The
two
men
resemble
each
other
closely
in
their
cunning
,
their
egotism
,
their
relentlessness
.
The
first
series
of
Sherlock_Holmes
adventures
ends
with
Holmes
and
Moriarty
grappling
together
on
the
edge
of
a
cliff
.
They
are
presumed
to
have
plunged
to
a
common
grave
in_this
fatal
embrace
.
Linked
to
Holmes
even
in
death
,
Moriarty
represents
the
alter-ego
of
the
great
detective
,
the
image
of_what
our
hero
might
have
become
were
he
not
a
public
servant
.
Just
as
Holmes
the
eccentric
stands
behind
Holmes
the
detective
,
so
Holmes
the
potential
criminal
lurks
behind
both
.
In
the
modern
English
``
whodunnit
''
,
this
insinuation
of
latent
criminality
in
the
detective
himself
has
almost
entirely
disappeared
.
Hercule_Poirot
and
Lord_Peter_Whimsey
(
the
respective
creations
of
Agatha_Christie
and
Dorothy_Sayers
)
have
retained
Holmes
'
egotism
but
not
his
zest
for
life
and
eccentric
habits
.
Poirot
and
his
counterparts
are
perfectly
respectable
people
;
it
is
true
that
they
are
also
extremely
dull
.
Their
dedication
to
the
status_quo
has
been
affirmed
at
the
expense
of
the
fascinating
but
dangerous
individualism
of
a
Sherlock_Holmes
.
The
latter
's
real
descendents
were
unable
to
take_root
in
England
;
they
fled
from
the
Victorian
parlor
and
made
their
way
across
the
stormy
Atlantic
.
In
the
American
``
hardboiled
''
detective_story
of
the
'
20
s
and
'
30
s
,
the
spirit
of
the
mad
genius
from
Baker_Street
lives
on
.
Like
Holmes
,
the
American
private_eye
rejects
the
social
conventions
of
his
time
.
But
unlike
Holmes
,
he
feels
his
society
to
be
not
merely
dull
but
also
corrupt
.
Surrounded
by
crime
and
violence
everywhere
,
the
``
hardboiled
''
private_eye
can
retain
his
purity
only
through
a
life
of
self-imposed
isolation
.
His
alienation
is
far
more
acute
than
Holmes
'
;
he
is
not
an
eccentric
but
rather
an
outcast
.
With
Rex_Stout
's
Nero_Wolfe
,
alienation
is
represented
on
a
purely
physical
plane
.
Wolfe
refuses
to
ever
leave
his
own
house
,
and
spends
most_of
his
time
drinking
beer
and
playing
with
orchids
.
More
profound
and
more
disturbing
,
however
,
is
the
moral
isolation
of
Raymond_Chandler
's
Philip_Marlowe
.
In
a
society
where
everything
is
for_sale
,
Marlowe
is
the
only
man
who
cannot
be
bought
.
His
tough
honesty
condemns
him
to
a
solitary
and
difficult
existence
.
Beaten
,
bruised
and
exhausted
,
he
pursues
the
elusive
killer
through
the
demi-monde
of
high_society
and
low
morals
,
always
alone
,
always
despised
.
In_the_end
,
he
gets
his
man
,
but
no
one
seems
to
care
;
virtue
is
its
own
and
only
reward
.
A
similar
tone
of
underlying
futility
and
despair
pervades
the
spy
thrillers
of
Eric_Ambler
and
dominates
the
most
famous
of
all
American
mystery_stories
,
Dashiell_Hammett
's
The
Maltese_Falcon
.
Sam_Spade
joins_forces
with
a
band
of
adventurers
in
search
of
a
priceless
jeweled
statue
of
a
falcon
;
but
when
the
bird
is
found
at_last
,
it
turns_out
to
be
a
fake
.
Now
the
detective
must
save
his
own
skin
by
informing
on
the
girl
he
loves
,
who
is
also
the
real
murderer
.
For
Sam_Spade
,
neither
crime
nor
virtue
pays
;
moreover
,
it
is
increasingly
difficult
to
distinguish
between
the
two
.
Because
the
private_eye
intends
to
save
society
in_spite_of
himself
,
he
invariably
finds
himself
in_trouble
with
the
police
.
The
latter
are
either
too
stupid
to
catch
the
killer
or
too
corrupt
to
care
.
In
either
case
,
they
do
not
appreciate
the
private_detective
's
zeal
.
Perry_Mason
and
Hamilton_Burger
,
Nero_Wolfe
and
Inspector_Cramer
spend
more
time
fighting
each
other
than
they
do
in
looking_for
the
criminal
.
Frequently
enough
,
the
police
are
themselves
in_league_with
the
killer
;
Dashiell_Hammett
's
Red_Harvest
provides
a
classic
example
of_this
theme
.
But
even
when
the
police
are
honest
,
they
do
not
trust
the
private_eye
.
He
is
,
like
Phillip_Marlowe
,
too
alienated
to
be
reliable
.
Finally
,
in
The
Maltese_Falcon
among
others
,
the
clash
between
detective
and
police
is
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion
:
Sam_Spade
becomes
the
chief
murder_suspect
.
In_order
to
exonerate
himself
,
he
is
compelled
to
find
the
real
criminal
,
who
happens
to
be
his
girl_friend
.
What
was
only
a
vague
suspicion
in
the
case
of
Sherlock_Holmes
now
appears
as
a
direct
accusation
:
the
private_eye
is
in
danger
of
turning_into
his
opposite
.
It
is
the
growing
contradiction
between
individualism
and
public
service
in
the
mystery_story
which
creates
this
fatal
dilemma
.
By
upholding
his
own
personal
code_of_behavior
,
the
private_detective
has
placed
himself
in
opposition
to
a
society
whose
fabric
is
permeated
with
crime
and
corruption
.
That
society
responds
by
condemning
the
private_eye
as
a
threat
to
the
status_quo
,
a
potential
criminal
.
If
the
detective
insists
upon
retaining
his
personal
standards
,
he
must
now
do
so
in
conscious
defiance
of
his
society
.
He
must
,
in_short
,
cease
to
be
a
detective
and
become
a
rebel
.
On_the_other_hand
,
if
he
wishes
to
continue
in
his
chosen
profession
,
he
must
abandon
his
own
code
and
sacrifice
his
precious
individualism
.
Dashiell_Hammett
resolved
this
contradiction
by
ceasing
to
write
mystery_stories
and
turning_to
other
pursuits
.
His
successors
have
adopted
the
opposite
alternative
.
In_order
to
save
the
mystery_story
,
they
have
converted
the
private_detective
into
an
organization
man
.
The
first
of
two
possible
variations
on
this
theme
is
symbolized
by
Mickey_Spillane
's
Mike_Hammer
.
At_first_glance
,
this
hero
seems
to
be
more
rather
than
less
of
an
individualist
than
any
of
his
predecessors
.
For
Hammer
,
nothing
is
forbidden
.
He
kills
when
he
pleases
,
takes
his
women
where
he
finds
them
and
always
acts_as
judge
,
jury
and
executioner
rolled_into_one
.
