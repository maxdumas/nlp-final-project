Hotel_Escape
's
Bonanza
room
has
a
real
bonanza
in
its
new
attraction
,
the
versatile
``
Kings
4
,
Plus
Two
''
.
This
is
the
strongest
act
to
hit
the
area
in
a
long
while
-
a
well
integrated
,
fast
moving
outfit
specializing
in
skits
,
vocals
,
comedy
and
instrumentals
all_of
it
distinctly
displaying
the
pro
touch
.
Show
spotlights
the
Kings
-
George_Worth
,
Bill_Kay
,
Frank_Ciciulla
and
Gene_Wilson
,
flanked
by
Dave_Grossman
and
Ron_Stevens
.
The
plus
two
remain
at
a
fixed
position
with
drums
and
guitar
but
the
quartet
covers
the
stage
with
a
batch
of
instruments
ranging
from
tuba
to
tambourine
,
and
the
beat
is
solid
.
In
the
comedy
division
,
the
Kings
simply
augmenting
talent
and
imagination
with
a_few
props
.
Net
result
is
some
crazy-wonderful
nonsense
,
part
of_which
can
be
classed
as
pure
slapstick
.
Kings
4
,
have
rated
as
a
popular
act
in
Vegas
and
Western
nightclubs
.
If
they
can
n't
chalk_up
big
business
here
then
let
's
stop
this
noise
about
how
hip
we
are
,
and
stick_to
our
community

Al
has
added
some
sidemen
to
the
act
which
makes_for
a
smoother
operation

it
's
substantially
the

heard
last
spring

Newcomers
are
Ernie_Kemm

,
Wes_Robbins
,
bass

and
Jack_Kelly

It
's
a
solid
show
but
,
except
for
some
interim
keyboarding
by
Ernie
,
it
's
Al
's
all_the_way
.
Maestro
's
biggest
stock
in
trade
is
his
personality
,
and
ability
to
establish
a
warm
rapport
with
his
audience
.
He
skips
around
from
jazz
,
to
blues
to
boogie
-
accompanying
himself
on
piano
and
frequently
pulling
the
customers
in
on
the
act
.
This
is
a
bouncy
show
which
may
get
a_little
too
frantic
at_times
,
but
is
nevertheless
worth
your
appraisal

Is
there
anything
a
frustrated
individual
can
do
about
Communism
's
growing
threat
on
our
doorstep
and
around
the
world
?
More_than
300
teenagers
last
Sunday
proved
there
is
and
as_many
more
are
expected
to
prove
it
again
for
Jim_Kern
and
his
wife
Lynn
from
4
to
8
p.
m._Sunday
at_First
Presbyterian_Church
.
At_that_time
the
second_half
of
the
Christian_Youth_Crusade
against
Communism
will
be
staged
.
A
young
real_estate
salesman
,
Kern
first
got
seriously
interested
in
the
problems
posed
by
Communism
when
in
the
Navy
Air_Force
.
He
was
particularly
struck
by
a
course
on
Communist
brainwashing
.
Kern
began
reading
a_lot
about
the
history
and
philosophy
of
Communism
,
but
never
felt
there
was
anything
he
,
as
an
individual
,
could
do
about
it
.
When
he
attended
the
Christian_Anti-Communist_Crusade
school
here
about
six
months
ago
,
Jim
became
convinced
that
an
individual
can
do
something
constructive
in
the
ideological
battle
and
set_out
to
do
it
.
The
best
approach
,
he
figured
,
was
to
try
to
influence
young
people
like
the
high
schoolers
he
and
his
wife
serve
as
advisors
at_First
Presbyterian_Church
.
And
he
wanted
to
be
careful
that
the
kids
not_only
learn
about
Communist
but
also
about
what
he
feels
is
the
only
antidote
-
a
Biblically
strong
Christianity
.
So
the
Christian_Youth_Crusade
against
Communisn
developed
and
more_than
300
top
teenagers
and
65
adult
advisers
from
Presbyterian_churches
of
the
area
sat
enthralled
at
the
four-hour
program
.
This
Sunday
those
attending
the
second
session
will
hear
a
lecture
by
Kern
on
the
world
situation
;
a
review
of
the
philosophy
of
Communist
leaders
by
Ted_Slack
,
another
real_estate_agent
who
became
interested
as
a
philosophy
major
at
the
University
of
Miami
;
and
talks
on
how
their
Christian
faith
can
guide
them
in
learning
about
and
fighting
Communism
during
high_school
and
college
days
,
by
Ted_Place
,
director
of
Greater_Miami_Youth
for
Christ
,
and
Jon_Braun
,
director
of
Campus_Crusade_for_Christ
.
The
second_half
of
the
film
``
Communism
on
the
Map
''
and
the
movie
``
Operation_Abolition
''
also
will
be_shown
.
Response
to
the
program
has
been
so
encouraging
,
Kern
said
,
that
a
city-wide
youth
school
at
Dade_County_Auditorium
may
be
set_up
soon
.
And
to
encourage
other
churches
to
try
their
own
programs
,
Kern
said
this
Sunday
's
sessions
-
including
the
free
dinner
-
will
be
open_to
anyone
who
makes
reservations
.
The
need
for
and
the
way
to
achieve
a
Christian
home
will
be
stressed
in
special
services
marking
National_Christian_Family_Week
in
Miami
area
churches
next
week
.
Of
particular
meaning
to
the
Charles_MacWhorter
family
,
3181
SW
24
th
Ter.
,
will
be
the
Family
Dedication
Service
planned
for
10
:
50
a.
m._Sunday
at_First
Christian_Church
.
It
will
be
the
second
time
the
assistant
manager
of
a
Coral_Gables
restaurant
and
his
wife
have
taken_part
in
the
twice-a-year
ceremonies
for
families
with
new
babies
.
The
first
one
,
two
years
ago
,
changed
the
routine
of
their
home
life
.
``
When
you
stand_up
in_public
and
take
vows
to
strive
to
set
an
example
before
your
children
and
to
teach
them
the
fundamentals
of
the
Christian
faith
,
you
strive
a_little
harder
to
uphold
those
vows
''
,
explains
the
slender
vice_president
of
the
young
couples
Sunday_school_class
.
Until
that
first
dedication
service
,
he
and
Lois
felt
their
children
were
too
young
to
take_part
in
any
religious
life
at_home
.
They
have
five
daughters
-
Coral_Lee
,
5
,
Glenda_Rae
,
4
,
Pamela
,
3
,
Karen
,
2
,
and
Shari
,
five
months
.
But
after_that
service
,
they
decided
to
try
to
let
the
girls
say
grace
at
the
table
,
have
bedtime
prayers
,
and
Bible
stories
.
To
their
surprise
,
the
children
all
were
eager
and
quite
able
to
take_part
.
Even
the
two-year-old
feels
miffed
if
the
family
has
a
prayer-time
without
her
.
