Built
upon
seven
hills
,
Istanbul
,
like
Rome
,
is
one
of
the_most
ancient
cities
in
the
world
,
filled
with
splendor
and
contrast
.
It
is
an
exotic
place
,
so
different
from
the
ordinary
that
the
casual
tourist
is
likely
to
see
at_first
only
the
contrast
and
the
ugliness
of
narrow
streets
lined
with
haphazard
houses
.
At
the
moment
,
many_of
these
are
being
pulled_down
.
Whole
blocks
are
disappearing
and
more
are
scheduled
to
vanish
to
make
room
for
wide
boulevards
that
will
show_off
its
treasures
to
better
advantage
-
the
great
domes
and
graceful
spires
of
its
mosques
,
the
panorama
of
the
Bosphorus
and
the
Golden_Horn
.
Even
when
they
are
finished
,
however
,
the
contrast
will
remain
,
for
Istanbul
is
the
only
city
in
the
world
that_is
built
upon
two
continents
.
For
almost
3000
years
Europe
and
Asia
have
rubbed
shoulders
in
its
streets
.
Founded
in
the
Ninth_Century_B._C.
it
was_called
Byzantium
200
years
later
when
Byzas
,
ruler
of
the
Megarians
,
expanded
the
settlement
and
named
it
after
himself
.
About
a_thousand
years
after_that
,
when
the
Roman_Empire
was
divided
,
it
became
capital
of
the
Eastern
section
.
On
May
11
,
330
A._D.
,
its
name
was
changed
again
,
this
time
to
Constantinople
after
its
emperor
,
Constantine
.
In
1453
when
the
last
vestige
of
ancient
Roman
power
fell
to
the
Turks
,
the
city
officially
shifted
religions
-
although
the
Patriarch
,
or
Pope
,
of
the
Orthodox_Church
continued
to
live
there
,
and
still
does
-
and
became
the
capital
of
the
Ottoman_Empire
.
When
that
was
broken_up
after
the
First_World_War
,
its
name
was
changed
once_more
.
Rich_in
Christian
and
Moslem
art
,
Istanbul
is
today
a
fascinating
museum
of
East
and
West
that
recently
became
a
seaside
resort
as_well
with
the
development
of
new
beaches
on
the
Bosphorus
and
the
Sea
of
Marmara
only
a
short
distance
from
the
center
of
town
.
Easy
to
get
to
,
and
becoming
more
popular
every_year
,
it
is
only
fourteen
hours
from
New_York
by
Pan_American_World
Airways
jet
,
four
hours
from
Rome
.
Most_of
the
sights
lie_in
the
old
section
across
the
Golden_Horn
from
the
modern
hotels
.
I
started
my
tour
of
them
at
the
Turkish
Government_Tourist_Office
,
next
to
Pan_American
's
office
on_the_left
as
you
enter
the
driveway
that
leads
to
the
Hilton_Hotel
.
From
there
I
turned
left
along
Cumhuriyet_Cadesi
past
more
hotels
and
a
park
on_the_left
,
Republic
Gardens
,
and
came_in
a_few
moments
to
Taksim_Square
,
one
of
the
hubs
of
the
city
,
with
the
Monument
of
the
Republic
,
erected
in
1928
,
in
its
center
.
Directly
across
from
the
Gardens
I
found
a
bus_stop
sign
for
T
4
and
rode
it
down
to
the
Bosphorus
,
with
the
sports
center
on
my
left
just
before
I
reached
the
water
and
the
entrance
to
Dolmabahce_Palace
immediately
after_that
.
There
the
bus
turned
right_along
the
Bosphorus
,
past
ocean_liners
at
anchor
,
to
Galata
Bridge
over
the
entrance
to
the
Golden_Horn
,
a
brown
sweep
of
water
that
empties
into
the
Bosphorus
.
Across
the
bridge
on_the_left
I
saw
St._Sophia
with
its
sturdy
brown
minarets
and
to
the
right
of
them
the
slenderer
spires
of
the_Blue
Mosque
.
On
the
other
side
of
the
Golden_Horn
I
rode
through
Eminonu_Square
,
with
Yeni_Cami
,
or
the
New_Mosque
,
which
dates_from
the
Seventeenth
Century
,
just
across
from
the
entrance
to
the
bridge
.
Passing
it
,
the
bus
climbed
a
hill
,
with
the
covered
spice
bazaar
on_the_right
and
Pandelli
's
,
a
famous
and
excellent
restaurant
,
above
it
.
At
the
top
of
the
hill
the
buildings
on_the_left
gave_way
to
a
park
.
I
got_off
there
,
crossed
the
street
,
walked
ahead
with
St._Sophia
on
my
left
,
the_Blue
Mosque
on
my
right
,
and
in_a_moment
came
to
the
entrance
of
St._Sophia
.
Erected
on
the
site
of
pagan
temples
and
three
previous
St._Sophias
,
the
first
of_which
was
begun
by
Constantine
,
this
fourth
church
was
started
by
Justinian
in
532
and
completed
twenty
years
later
.
On
his
first
trip
to
the
finished
structure
he
boasted
that
he
had
built
a
temple
grander
than
Solomon
's
in
Jerusalem
.
A_few
years
later
the
dome
fell_in
.
Nevertheless
,
it
remained
one
of
the_most
splendid
churches
of
the
Eastern_Empire
,
where
the
Byzantine
Emperors
were
crowned
.
After
the
Turks
conquered
the
city
in
1453
they
converted
it
to
a
mosque
,
adding
the
stubby
minarets
.
In
the
second_half
of
the
Sixteenth_Century
,
Sinan
,
the
great
architect
who
is
the
Michelangelo
of
the
East
,
designed
the
massive
buttresses
that
now
help
support
the
dome
.
With
the
birth
of
the
Turkish
Republic
after
the
First_World_War
,
St._Sophia
became
a
museum
,
and
the
ancient
mosaics
,
which
were
plastered_over
by
the
Moslems
,
whose
religion
forbids
pictures
in
holy_places
,
have
been_restored
.
Inside
over
the
first
door
I
saw
one
of
these
,
which
shows
Constantine
offering
the
city
to
the_Virgin
Mary
and
Justinian
offering
the
temple
.
On
the
columns
around
the
immense
dome
are
round
plaques
with
Arabic
writing
.
The
eight
green
columns
,
I
learned
,
came
from
the
Temple
of
Artemis
at
Ephesus
,
the
others
,
red
,
from
the
Temple
of
the
Sun
at
Heliopolis
.
Beneath
the
dome
I
saw
the
spot
where
the
Byzantine
Emperors
were
crowned
,
a_bit
of
floor
protected
now
by
a
wooden
fence
.
Behind
this
is
a
minber
or
Moslem
pulpit
and
near
it
a
raised
platform
with
golden
grillwork
,
where
the
emperors
and
,
after
them
,
the
sultans
,
sat
.
Directly
opposite
is
the
emperor
's
door
,
through
which
they
entered
the
building
.
Outside
St._Sophia
I
walked
through
the
flower_garden
in_front
of_it
,
with
the_Blue
Mosque
ahead
on
my
left
.
Across
the
street
on
my
right
I
saw
the
Hippodrome
,
now
a
park
.
It
was
laid_out
in
196
for
chariot_races
and
other
public
games
.
Statues
and
other
monuments
that
stood
there
were
stolen
,
mostly
by
the
waves
of
Crusaders
.
At
the
beginning
of
the
Hippodrome
I
saw
the
Kaiser
's
Fountain
,
an
ugly
octagonal
building
with
a
glass
dome
,
built
in
1895
by
the
German
Emperor
,
and
on
my
left
,
directly
across
from_it
,
the
tomb
of
Sultan_Ahmet
,
who
constructed
the_Blue
Mosque
,
more
properly
known
by
his
name
.
Just
before
coming
to
the
mosque
entrance
I
crossed
the
street
,
entered
the
Hippodrome
,
and
walked
ahead
to
the
Obelisk
of
Theodosius
,
originally
erected
in
Heliopolis
in
Egypt
about
1600
B._C.
by
Thutmose
,
who
also
built
those
now
in
New_York
,
London
and
Rome
at
the
Lateran
.
This
one
was
set_up
here
in
390
A._D.
on
a
pedestal
,
the
faces
of_which
are
carved
with
statues
of
the
emperor
and
his
family
watching
games
in
the
Hippodrome
,
done
so
realistically
that
the
obelisk
itself
is_included_in
them
.
Beyond
it
I
noted
a
small
green
column
,
about
twelve
feet
below
the
present
ground_level
-
the
Serpentine
Column
,
three
entwined
serpents
,
which
once
stood
at
the
Temple
of
Apollo
at
Delphi
,
Greece
.
Near
the
end
of
the
Hippodrome
I
came_upon
the
Built
Column
,
a
truncated
obelisk
of
blocks
,
all
that
remains
of
a
monument
that
once
rivalled
the
Colossus
of
Rhodes
.
Retracing
my
steps
to
the
Mosque
of
Sultan_Ahmet
,
only
one
with
six
minarets
,
I
entered
the
courtyard
,
with
a
gallery
supported
by
pointed_arches
running
around
it
and
a
fountain
in_the_middle
.
One
of
the_most
beautiful
buildings
in
Istanbul
,
it
was_constructed
in
the
early
years
of
the
Seventeenth
Century
,
with
a
huge
central
dome
,
two
half
domes
that
seem
to
cascade_down
from_it
,
and
smaller
full
domes
around
the
gallery
.
The
round
minarets
,
tall
and
graceful
,
rise
from
rectangular
bases
and
have
three
platforms
from
which
the
muezzin
can
chant
his
call
to
prayer
.
Inside
,
the
walls
are
covered
with
blue
and
white
tile
,
the
floor
with
red
and
cream
carpets
.
Back
at
the
Kaiser
's
Fountain
,
I
walked
left
to
the
streetcar
stop
and
rode
up
the
hill
-
any
car
will
do
-
past
the
Column
of
Constantine
,
also_known_as
the
Burnt
Column
,
at
the
top
on
my
right
.
It
stands
in
the
middle
of_what
was
once
the
Forum
of
Constantine
,
who
brought
it
from
Rome
.
I
stayed
on
the
car
for
a_few
minutes
until
,
turning
right
,
it
entered
a
huge
square
,
Bayezit
,
with
the
Bayezit_Mosque
on_the_right
and
the
gate
to
the
university
just
beyond
it
.
There
I
got_off
,
crossed
the
square
,
and
on_the_side
directly
opposite
the
gate
found
a
good
restaurant
,
hard
to
come_by
in_this
part
of
the
city
.
Called
the
Marmara_Gazinosu
,
it
is
on
the
third
floor
,
with
signs
pointing_the_way
there
,
and
has
a
terrace
overlooking
the
Sea
of
Marmara
.
After
lunch
,
in
the
arcade
on
my
left
just
before
reaching
the
street
I
found
a
pastry
shop
that
sells
some
of
the
best
baklava
-
a
sweet
,
flaky
cake
-
in
Istanbul
.
It
's
a
great
favorite
of
the
university_students
,
and
I
joined
them
there
for
dessert
.
Taking
the
streetcar
back
to
Kaiser
's
Fountain
,
I
walked
ahead
,
then
left
down
the
street
opposite
St._Sophia
and
just
beyond
the
corner
came
to
a
small
,
one-story
building
with
a
red-tile
roof
,
which
is
the
entrance
to
the
Sunken_Palace
.
Actually
an
underground
cistern
,
its
roof
supported
by
rows
and
rows
of
pillars
,
it
was_built
by
Justinian
in
the
Sixth_Century
to
supply
the
palace
with
water
.
There
is
still
water
in
it
.
I
found
it
fairly
depressing
and
emerged
almost
immediately
.
Outside
I
walked
past
the
entrance
to
St._Sophia
,
turned
left
at
the
end
of_it
,
and
continued
toward
a
gate
in
the
wall
ahead
.
Just
before
reaching
it
I
came
to
a
grey
and
brown
stone
building
that
looks
somewhat
like
an
Oriental
pagoda
,
with
Arabic
lettering
in
gold
and
colored
tile
decorations
-
the
Fountain
of
Sultan_Ahmet
.
Going
through
the
Imperial_Gate
in
the
wall
,
I
entered
the
grounds
of
Topkapi_Palace
,
home
of
the
Sultans
and
nerve_center
of
the
vast
Ottoman_Empire
,
and
walked
along
a
road
toward
another
gate
in
the
distance
,
past
the
Church
of
St._Irene
,
completed
by
Constantine
in
330
A._D.
on
my
left
,
and_then
,
just
outside
the
second
gate
,
I
saw
a
spring
with
a
tap
in
the
wall
on
my
right
-
the
Executioner
's
Spring
,
where
he
washed
his
hands
and
his
sword
after
beheading
his
victims
.
Passing_through
the
gate
,
with
towers
on
either
side
once
used
as
prisons
,
I
entered
a
huge
square
surrounded
by
buildings
,
and
on
the
wall
to
my
right
found
a
general
plan
of
the
grounds
,
with
explanations
in
English
for
each
building
.
There
are
a
good
many_of
them
.
At_one_time
about
10000
people
lived
there
.
Following
arrowed
signs
,
I
veered
right
toward
the
former
kitchens
,
complete
with
chimneys
,
which
now
house
one
of
the
world
's
greatest
collections
of
Chinese
porcelain
and
a
fabulous
array
of
silver
dinner_services
.
Next
to_it
is
a
copper
section
,
with
cooking_utensils
and
a
figure
of
the
chief
cook
in
an
elaborate
,
floor-length
robe
.
In
the
court
once_more
,
I
went
right
toward
the
Reception
House
,
a
long
one-story
building
with
a
deep
portico
.
Going
through
a
door
into
another
small
court
,
I
had
the
Throne
Room
directly
in_front
.
I
walked
to
the
right
around
it
to
buildings
containing
illuminated
manuscripts
and
came
to
the
Treasury
,
which
houses
such
things
as
coffee_cups
covered
with
diamonds
,
jewelled
swords
,
rifles
glittering
with
diamonds
and
huge
divan-like
thrones
as
large
as
small
beds
,
on_which
the
sultans
sat
cross-legged
.
They
are
made
of
gold
and
covered
with
emeralds
,
pearls
and
other
jewels
.
Taking
the
path
behind
the
Throne
Room
to
the
building
directly
beyond
it
,
the
Portrait
Gallery
,
I
went
right
at
the
end
of_it
,
through
a
garden
to
a
small
building
at
the
back
-
a
sitting_room
furnished
with
low
blue
divans
,
its
floor
covered
with
carpets
,
its
ceiling
painted
with
gold
squares
and
floral
designs
.
