Dear
Sirs
:
Let
me
begin
by
clearing_up
any
possible
misconception
in
your
minds
,
wherever
you
are
.
The
collective
by
which
I
address
you
in
the
title
above
is
neither
patronizing
nor
jocose
but
an
exact
industrial
term
in_use
among
professional
thieves
.
It
is
,
I
am
reliably
given
to
understand
,
the
technical
argot
for
those
who
engage
in
your
particular
branch
of
the
boost
;
i.e.
,
burglars
who
rob
while
the
tenants
are
absent
,
in
contrast
to
hot
slough
prowlers
,
those
who
work
while
the
occupants
are
home
.
Since
the
latter
obviously
require
an
audacity
you
do
not
possess
,
you
may
perhaps
suppose
that
I
am
taunting
you
as
socially
inferior
.
Far
from
it
;
I
merely
draw
an
etymological
distinction
,
hoping
that
specialists
and
busy
people
like
you
will
welcome
such
precision
in
a
layman
.
Above_all
,
disabuse
yourselves
of
any
thought
that
I
propose
to
vent
moral
indignation
at
your
rifling
my
residence
,
to
whimper
over
the
loss
of
a_few
objets_d'art
,
or
to
shame
you
into
rectitude
.
My
object
,
rather
,
is
to
alert
you
to
an
aspect
or
two
of
the
affair
that
could
have
the
gravest
implications
for
you
,
far
beyond
the
legal
sanctions
society
might
inflict
.
You
have
unwittingly
set_in_motion
forces
so
malign
,
so
vindictive
,
that
it
would
be
downright
inhumane
of
me
not
to
warn
you
about
them
.
Quite
candidly
,
fellows
,
I
would
n't
be_in_your_shoes
for
all
the
rice
in
China
.
As
you
've
doubtless
forgotten
the
circumstances
in
the
press
of
more
recent
depredations
,
permit
me
to
recapitulate
them
briefly
.
Sometime
on
Saturday
evening
,
August
22nd
,
while
my
family
and
I
were
dining
at
the
Hostaria_dell_'Orso
,
in
Rome
,
you
jimmied
a
window
of
our
home
in
Bucks_County
,
Pennsylvania
,
and
let
yourselves
into
the
premises
.
Hastening
to
the
attic
,
the
temperature
of_which
was
easily
hotter
than
the
Gold_Coast
,
you
proceeded
to
mask
the
windows
with
a
fancy
wool
coverlet
,
some
khaki
pants
,
and
the_like
,
and
to
ransack
the
innumerable
boxes
and
barrels
stored
there
.
What
you
were
looking_for
(
unless
you
make
a
hobby
of
collecting
old
tennis_rackets
and
fly
screens
)
eludes
me
,
but
to
judge
from
phonograph_records
scattered
about
a
fumed_oak
Victrola
,
you
danced
two
tangos
and
a
paso_doble
,
which
must
have
been
fairly
enervating
in
that
milieu
.
You
then
descended
one
story
,
glommed
a
television_set
from
the
music
room
-
the
only
constructive
feature
of
your
visit
,
by_the_way
-
and
,
returning
to
the
ground_floor
,
entered
the
master_bedroom
.
From
the
curio
cabinet
on
its
south
wall
and
the
bureaus
beneath
,
you
abstracted
seventeen
ivory
,
metal
,
wood
,
and
stone
sculptures
of
Oriental
and
African
origin
,
two
snuffboxes
,
and
a
jade
handled
magnifying_glass
.
Rummaging
through
a
stack
of
drawers
nearby
,
you
unearthed
an
antique
French
chess_set
in
ivory
and
sandalwood
,
which
,
along
with
two
box_Kodaks
,
you
added
to
your
haul
.
Then
,
having
wrapped
the
lot
in
an
afghan
my
dog
customarily
slept
on
,
you
lammed
out
the
front_door
,
considerately
leaving
it
open
for
neighbors
to
discover
.
So_much_for
the
tiresome
facts
,
as
familiar
to
you
,
I'm
sure
,
as
to
the
constables
and
state
troopers
who
followed
in
your
wake
.
The
foregoing
,
aided
by
several
clues
I
'll
withhold
to
keep
you
on_your_toes
,
will
pursue
you
with
a
tenacity
worthy
of
Inspector_Javert
,
but
before
they
close_in
,
gird
yourselves
,
I
repeat
,
for
a
vengeance
infinitely
more
pitiless
.
Fourteen
of
the
sculptures
you
took
posses
properties
of
a
most
curious
and
terrifying
nature
,
as
you
will
observe
when
your
limbs
begin
to
wither
and
your
hair
falls_out
in
patches
.
In_time
,
these
minor
manifestations
will
multiply
and
effloresce
,
riddling
you
with
frambesia
,
the
king's_evil
,
sheep_rot
,
and
clonic
spasm
,
until
your
very
existence
becomes
a
burden
and
you
cry_out_for
release
.
All
this
,
though
,
is
simply
a
prelude
,
a
curtain-raiser
,
for
what
ensues
,
and
I
doubt
whether
any
Occidental
could
accurately
forecast
it
.
If
,
however
,
it
would
help
to
intensify
your
anguish
,
I
can
delimit
the
powers
of
a_few
of
the
divinities
you
've
affronted
and
describe
the
punishment
they
meted_out
in
one
analogous
instance
.
Hold_on
tight
.
First_of_all
,
the
six
figures
of
the
Buddha
you
heisted
-
four
Siamese
heads
,
a
black
obsidian
statuette
in
the
earth
touching
position
,
and
a
large
brass
figure
of
the
Dying_Buddha
on
a
teakwood
base
.
Now
,
you
probably
share
the
widespread
Western
belief
that
the
Lord_Buddha
is
the
most
compassionate
of
the
gods
,
much
more
so
than
Jehovah
and
Allah
and
the
rest
.
'
Fess
up
-
do
n't
you
?
Well
,
ordinarily
he
is
,
except
(
as
the
Wheel_of_the_Law
specifies
)
toward
impious
folk
who
steal
,
disturb
,
or
maltreat
the
Presence
.
Very
peculiar
retribution
indeed
seems
to
overtake
such
jokers
.
Eight
or
ten
years
ago
,
a_couple_of
French
hoods
stole
a
priceless
Khmer
head
from
the
Musee_Guimet
,
in
Paris
,
and
a
week
later
crawled
into
the
Salpetriere
with
unmistakable
symptoms
of
leprosy
.
Hell
's
own
amount
of
chaulmoogra_oil
did
nothing
to
alleviate
their
torment
;
they
expired
amid
indescribable
fantods
,
imploring
the
Blessed_One
to
forgive
their
desecration
.
Any
reputable
French
interne
can
supply
you
with
a
dozen
similar
instances
,
and
I
'll
presently
recount
a
case
out
of
my
own
personal
experience
,
but
,
for_the_moment
,
let
's
resume
our
catalogue
.
Whether
the
pair
of
Sudanese
ivory
carvings
you
lifted
really
possess
the
juju
to
turn
your
livers
to
lead
,
as
a
dealer
in
Khartoum
assured
me
,
I
am
not
competent
to
say
.
Likewise
the
ivory
Chinese
female
figure
known
as
a
``
doctor
lady
''
(
provenance
Honan
)
;
a
friend
of
mine
removing
her
from
the
curio
cabinet
for
inspection
was
felled
as
if
by
a
hammer
,
but
he
had
previously
drunk
a
quantity
of
applejack
.
The
three
Indian
brass
deities
,
though
-
Ganessa
,
Siva
,
and
Krishna
-
are
an
altogether
different
cup_of_tea
.
They
hail
from
Travancore
,
a
state
in
the
subcontinent
where
Kali
,
the
goddess
of
death
,
is
worshiped
.
Have
you
ever
heard
of
thuggee
?
Nuf
sed
.
But
it
is
the
wooden
sculpture
from
Bali
,
the
one
representing
two
men
with
their
heads
bent
backward
and
their
bodies
interlaced
by
a
fish
,
that
I
particularly
call
to
your
attention
.
Oddly_enough
,
this
is
an
amulet
against
housebreakers
,
presented
to
the
mem
and
me
by
a
local
rajah
in
1949
.
Inscribed
around
its
base
is
a
charm
in
Balinese
,
a
dialect
I
take
it
you
do
n't
comprehend
.
Neither
do
I
,
but
the
Tjokorda_Agoeng
was
good
enough
to
translate
,
and
I
'll
do
as
much
for
you
.
Whosoever
violates
our
rooftree
,
the
legend
states
,
can
expect
maximal
sorrow
.
The
teeth
will
rain
from
his
mouth
like
pebbles
,
his
wife
will
make
him
cocu
with
fishmongers
,
and
a
trolley_car
will
grow
in
his
stomach
.
Furthermore
-
and
this
,
to
me
,
strikes
an
especially
warming
note
-
it
shall
avail
the
vandals
naught
to
throw_away
or
dispose
of
their
loot
.
The
cycle
of
disaster
starts
the
moment
they
touch
any
belonging
of
ours
,
and
dogs
them
unto
the
forty-fifth
generation
.
Sort_of
remorseless
,
is
n't
it
?
Still
,
there
it
is
.
Now
,
you
no_doubt
regard
the
preceding
as
pap
;
you
're
tooling_around
full
of
gage
in
your
hot_rods
,
gorging
yourselves
on
pizza
and
playing
pinball
in
the
taverns
and
generally
behaving
like
Ubermenschen
.
In
that
case
,
listen
to
what
befell
another
wisenheimer
who
tangled_with
our
joss
.
A_couple_of
years
back
,
I
occupied
a
Village
apartment
whose
outer
staircase
contained
the
type
of
niche
called
a
``
coffin
turn
''
.
In
it
was
a
stone
Tibetan
Buddha
I
had
picked_up
in
Bombay
,
and
occasionally
,
to
make
merit
,
my
wife
and
I
garlanded
it
with
flowers
or
laid
a_few
pennies
in
its
lap
.
After
a
while
,
we
became
aware
that
the
money
was
disappearing
as
fast
as
we
replenished
it
.
Our
suspicions
eventually
centered
,
by
the
process
of
elimination
,
on
a
grocer
's
boy
,
a
thoroughly
bad_hat
,
who
delivered
cartons
to
the
people
overhead
.
The
more
I
probed
into
this
young_man
's
activities
and
character
,
the
less
savory
I
found
him
.
I
learned
,
for_example
,
that
he
made
a
practice
of
yapping
at
dogs
he
encountered
and
,
in
winter
,
of
sprinkling
salt
on
the
icy
pavement
to
scarify
their
feet
.
His
energy
was
prodigious
;
sometimes
he
would
be
up
before
dawn
,
clad
as
a
garbage_collector
and
hurling
pails
into
areaways
to
exasperate
us
,
and
thereafter
would
hurry
to
the
Bronx_Zoo
to
grimace
at
the
lions
and
press
cigar_butts
against
their
paws
.
Evenings
,
he
was
frequently
to
be
seen
at
restaurants
like
Enrico
+
Paglieri's
or
Peter's_Backyard
drunkenly
donning
ladies
'
hats
and
singing
``
O_Sole_Mio
''
.
In_short
,
and
to
borrow
an
arboreal
phrase
,
slash_timber
.
Well
,
the
odious
little
toad
went_along
chivying
animals
and
humans
who
could
n't
retaliate
,
and
in_due_course
,
as
was
inevitable
,
overreached
himself
.
One
morning
,
we
discovered
not_only
that
the
pennies
were
missing
from
the
idol
but
that
a
cigarette
had
been
stubbed_out
in
its
lap
.
``
Now
he
's
bought_it
''
,
said
my
wife
contentedly
.
``
No
divinity
will
hold_still_for
that
.
He
's
really
asking
for
it
''
.
And
how
right
she
was
.
The
next
time
we
saw
him
,
he
was
a
changed
person
;
he
had
aged
thirty
years
,
and
his
face
,
the
color
of
tallow
,
was
crisscrossed
with
wrinkles
,
as
though
it
had
been
wrapped
in
chicken
wire
.
Some
sort_of
nemesis
was
haunting
his
footsteps
,
he
told
us
in
a
quavering
voice
-
either
an
ape
specter
or
Abe_Spector
,
a
process_server
,
we
could
n't
determine
which
.
His
eyes
had
the
same
dreadful
rigid
stare
as
Dr._Grimesby_Roylott
's
when
he
was
found
before
his
open
safe
wearing
the
speckled
band
.
The
grocery
the
youth
worked
for
soon
tired_of
his
depressing
effect
on
customers
,
most
of
whom
were
sufficiently
neurotic
without
the
threat
of
incubi
,
and
let
him
go
.
The
beautiful
,
the
satisfying
part
of
his
disintegration
,
however
,
was
the
masterly
way
the
Buddha
polished
him
off
.
Reduced
to
beggary
,
he
at_last
got
a
job
as
office_boy
to
a
television
producer
.
His
hubris
,
deficiency
of
taste
,
and
sadism
carried
him
straightaway
to
the
top
.
He
evolved
programs
that
plumbed
new
depths
of
bathos
and
besmirched
whole
networks
,
and
quickly
superseded
his
boss
.
Not
long_ago
,
I
rode
down
with
him
in
an
elevator
in
Radio_City
;
he
was
talking
to
himself
thirteen
to
the
dozen
and
smoking
two
cigars
at_once
,
clearly
a
man
in_extremis
.
``
See
that
guy
''
?
the
operator
asked
pityingly
.
``
I
would
n't
be_in_his_shoes
for
all
the
rice
in
China
.
There
's
some
kind_of
a
nemesis
haunting
his
footsteps
''
.
However
one
looks_at
it
,
therefore
,
I
'd
say
that
your
horoscope
for
this
autumn
is
the
reverse
of
rosy
.
The
inventory
you
acquired
from
me
is
n't
going_to
be
easy
to
move
;
you
can't
very
well
sidle
up
to
people
on
the
street
and
ask
if
they
want
to
buy
a
hot
Bodhisattva
.
Additionally
,
since
you
're
going_to
be
hors_de_combat
pretty
soon
with
sprue
,
yaws
,
Delhi_boil
,
the
Granville_wilt
,
liver_fluke
,
bilharziasis
,
and
a
host
of
other
complications
of
the
hex
you
've
aroused
,
you
must
n't
expect
to
be
lionized
socially
.
My
advice
,
if
you
live
long
enough
to
continue
your
vocation
,
is
that
the
next
time
you
're
attracted
by
the
exotic
,
pass
it
up
-
it
's
nothing
but
a
headache
.
As
you
can
count_on
me
to
do
the
same
.
compassionately
yours

S._J._Perelman
.
The
doors
of
the
D
train
slid
shut
,
and
as
I
dropped
into
a
seat
and
,
exhaling
,
looked
up
across
the
aisle
,
the
whole
aviary
in
my
head
burst
into
song
.
She
was
a
living
doll
and
no
mistake
-
the
blue-black
bang
,
the
wide
cheekbones
,
olive
flushed
,
that
betrayed
the
Cherokee
strain
in
her
Midwestern
lineage
,
and
the
mouth
whose
only
fault
,
in
the
novelist
's
carping
phrase
,
was
that
the
lower
lip
was
a_trifle
too
voluptuous
.
From
what
I
was
able
to
gauge
in
a
swift
,
greedy
glance
,
the
figure
inside
the
coral
colored
boucle
dress
was
stupefying
.
