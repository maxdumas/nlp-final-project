Those
who
have
never
traveled
the
width
and
length
of_this
land
cannot
conceive
,
on
the
basis
of
textbook
description
alone
,
the
overwhelming
space
and
variety
of_this
country
held
together
under
one
government
.
The
miracle
of
democratic
America
comes_home
to
one
most
strongly
only
when
one
has
seen
the
endless
Great_Plains
of
the
Midwest
;
the
sky-reaching
peaks
of
the
Northwest
mountains
;
the
smoke-filled
,
art-filled
,
drama-filled
life
of
the
great
cities
of
the
East
;
the
lush
and
historic
charm
of
the
South
.
Now
,
to_add_to
the
already
unbelievable
extremes
found
in
one
nation
,
we
have
the
two
new
states
of
Hawaii
and
Alaska
.
To
hope
to
cover
just
one
region
of_this
land
and
to
enjoy
all_of
its
sights
and
events
and
,
of_course
,
to
bring_back
pictures
of
your
experiences
,
requires
advance
planning
.
For
this
reason
,
U._S._Camera
has
prepared
this
special
U._S._A.
vacation
feature
.
We
divided
the
country
into
five
regions
plus
Hawaii
and
Alaska
and
in
each
is
included
a
general
description
of
the
area
plus
specific
recommendations
of
places
and
events
to
cover
.
Any
special
photographic
requirements
are
also
given
.
Use
this
section

most
of
your

in
photogenic

The
Southern
United_States
,
extending
from

spectacles
of

Of
special

One
of
the_most
delightful
spots
in
a
southern
tour

the
city
of

.
The
famous
old_French
and
Spanish
buildings
with
their
elaborate
wrought_iron
balconies
and
the
narrow
streets
of
the
Latin_Quarter
present
an

scene
.

the
famous
Alamo

photograph
18
th
Century
Spanish
buildings
and
churches

The
Great_Smoky

another
area

the
South
well
worth
a
visit
.
Along
the
127
-
mile
route
through
Great_Smoky
Mountains
National_Park
you

photograph
the
breath-taking
peaks
,
gorges
and
valleys
which
come
into

Tennessee
,
is
the
center
of_this
area
.
Another
scenic
spot
in
Tennessee
is
Chattanooga
where
the
Rock_City
Gardens
are
not
to
be
missed
.

the
Southern
locales
mentioned
above
and
some
specific
tips
on
how
and
where
to
shoot
it
are
in_order
.
For_example
,
the
Chamber_of_Commerce
of
Gatlinburg
,
Tennessee
,
sponsors
special
camera
tours
into
the
Great_Smoky
Mountains
to
get
pictures
of
the
profusion
of
wild_flowers
flourishing
in
these
wooded
regions
.
Exposure
problems
may
occur
in
these
forest
areas
where
uneven
lighting
results
from
shafts
of
sunlight
filtering
through
the
overhead
branches
.
Best
solution
is
to
find
an
area
that
is
predominantly
sunlight
or
shade
.
In
any
instance
,
you
should
determine
the
exposure
according
to
the
type
of
light
which
falls
on
most_of
the
subject_area
.
Try
some
closeups
on
Southern
blossoms
to
provide
a
welcome
contrast
with
the
many
long-view
scenics
you
'll
be
making
.
For
shooting
the
interiors
of
the
famous
ante-bellum
Southern
mansions
make
sure
your
equipment
includes
a
tripod
.
Enough
daylight
is
usually
available
from
the
windows
,
but
if
you
have
synchronized
flash
-
use
it
.
For
some
unusual
photographic
subjects
,
if
your
vacation
takes
you
nearby
,
try
these
events
:
the
600
-
mile
auto
race
in
Charlotte
,
N._C.
,
on
May
27
;

,
May

-

.
Peak
action
photography
is
your
goal
at
Miami
's
Seaquarium
and
the
Cypress
Gardens
waterskiing
events
.
A
pleasant
start
to
your
midwestern
vacation
is
a_few
days
spent
in
cosmopolitan
Chicago
.
Lake_Michigan
offers
swimming
and
pictures
which
combine
cityscapes
with
beaches
.
A
visit

Chicago
's
museums

around
broad
Michigan_Avenue
will
unfold
many
photogenic
subjects
to
the
alert
photographer
.
Wisconsin_Dells
,
where
fantastically
scenic
rocks
carved
by
the
Wisconsin_River
are
overgrown
with
fern
and
other
foliage
,
rates
a
stopover
when
traveling
from
Chicago
.
The
farmlands
forming
the
heart
of
America
stretch
out
across
the
Midwest
from
Chicago
.
In
North_Dakota
the
strangely
beautiful
Badlands
will
challenge
you
to
translate
its
wonder
on
to
film
.
While
here
,
visit
Theodore_Roosevelt
National_Park
for
its
spectacular
scenery
.
Another
spot
with
an
image-provoking
name
is
the
Black_Hills
where
you
can
visit
the
old
frontier
mining
town
of
Deadwood
.
The
Black_Hills
Passion_Play
is
produced
every
summer
and
is
a
pageant
worth
seeing
and
shooting
.
Of_course
,
while
in_this
vicinity
you
won
n't
want
to
miss
a
visit
to
Mount_Rushmore_National_Memorial
where
on_the_side
of
a
mountain
are
the
famous
sculptures
of
Presidents
Washington
,
Lincoln
,
Jefferson
and
Theodore_Roosevelt
.
In
Missouri
(
which
we
are
including
in
our
general
Midwest
region
)
you
can
glance
into
Mark_Twain
's
birthplace
at
Hannibal
,
see
the
landmarks
of
his
life
and
writings
and
visualize
where
Huck_Finn
hatched
his
boyish
mischief
.
Similarly
in
Illinois
there
is
Lincoln
country
to
be
seen
-
his
tomb
and
other
landmarks
.
Minnesota
,
fabled
land
of
waters
,
is
in
itself
,
ideal
vacationland
,
having
within
its
borders
10000
lakes
!
Itasca_State_Park
,
where
the
Mississippi_River
begins
,
is
one
of
the
outstanding
tourist
spots
in
Minnesota
.
Mementoes
of
the
Old_West
recall
the
days
of
Wyatt_Earp
in
Dodge_City
,
Nebraska
,
where
present-day
cowboys
add
a
colorful
human
interest
note
to
your
vacation
shooting
.
Of
current
interest
is
Abilene
,
Kansas
,
the
birthplace
of
ex-President_Eisenhower
.
There
's
a
museum
here
and
also
Old_Abilene_Town
,
a
reconstruction
of
the
cattle
boomtown
of
the
70
's
and
80
's
.
For
a
resort
area
,
Mackinack_Island
,
Michigan
,
is
the
place
to
visit
.
It
truly
relives
another
age
for
the
inhabitants
use
carriages
rather_than
autos
and
old
British
and
French
forts
are_left
intact
for
tourists
to
visit
and
record
.
Night
scenes
will
add
an
exciting
touch
to
your
vacation
travelogue
and
what
better
place
to
take
them
then
along
Chicago
's
Lake_Shore_Drive
?
Just
after
sunset
is
a
good
time
to
record
the
city
lights
in
color
since
you
get
a
``
fill-in
''
light
from
the
sky
.
Another
memo
for
sightseers
:
bring
your
camera
along
to
museums
.
Photos
of
historic
dioramas
of
the
area
you
visit
will
add
depth
and
background
to
your
vacation
photo
story
.
Again
,
be
sure
your
tripod
is
handy
for
those
sometimes-necessary
time_exposures
.

A
Western
vacation
is
practically
synonymous
with
a
visit
to
at_least
one
of
the
magnificent
national_parks
in_this
area
.
A
tour
of
several
of
them
is
possible
in
a
two-week
vacation
while
a
stay
at
just
one
of
these
natural
beauty_spots
can
be
of
equal
reward
.
In
California
is
located
one
of
the_most
popular
of
the
national_parks
-
Yosemite
.
Among
its
most
spectacular
features
are
its
falls
,
the
highest
being
Upper_Yosemite
which
drops
2425
feet
.
The
Sequoia_Grove
presents
another
unique
aspect
of
Yosemite
,
for
these
ancient
giant
trees
are
a
sight
never
to
be
forgotten
.
In
the
Utah
area
are
Zion
National_Park
and
Bryce_Canyon
National_Park
.
Fantastic
colors
are
to
be
seen
in
the
fanciful
formations
of
eroded
rock
which
loom
out
of
the
semiarid
country
in
both
parks
.
Colorado
's
Grand_Canyon
,
probably
the_most
famous
landmark
of
the
United_States
,
can
be
the
highpoint
of
your
Western
vacation
.
