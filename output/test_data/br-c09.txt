Murray_Louis
and
his
dance
company
appeared
at
the
Henry_Street_Playhouse
on
Friday
and
Saturday
evenings
and
Sunday
afternoons
in
the
premiere
of
his
latest
work
,
``
Signal
''
,
and
the
repetition
of
an
earlier
one
,
``
Journal
''
.
``
Signal
''
is
choreographed
for
three
male
dancers
to
an
electronic
score
by
Alwin_Nikolais
.
Its
abstract
decor
is
by
John_Hultberg
.
Program
note
reads
as_follows
:
``
Take
hands
,
this
urgent
visage
beckons
us
''
.
Here
,
as
in
``
Journal
''
,
Mr._Louis
has
given
himself
the
lion
's
share
of
the
dancing
,
and
there
is
no_doubt
that
he
is
capable_of
conceiving
and
executing
a
wide
variety
of
difficult
and
arresting
physical
movements
.
Indeed
,
both
``
Journal
''
and
``
Signal
''
qualify
as
instructive
catalogues
of
modern-dance
calisthenics
.
But
chains
of
movements
are
not
necessarily
communicative
,
and
it
is
in
the
realm
of
communication
that
the
works
prove
disappointing
.
One
frequently
has
the
feeling
that
the
order
of
their
movement
combinations
could
be
transposed
without
notable
loss
of
effect
,
there
is
too
little
suggestion
of
organic
relationship
and
development
.
It
may
be
,
of_course
,
that
Mr._Louis
is
consciously
trying
to
create
works
that
anticipate
an
age
of
total
automation
.
But
it
may
be
,
also
,
that
he
is
merely
more
mindful
of
athletics
than
of
esthetics
at_the_present_time
.
One
thing
is
certain
,
however
,
and
that
is
that
he
is
far
more
slavish
to
the
detailed
accents
,
phrasings
and
contours
of
the
music
he
deals
with
than
a
confident
dance
creator
need
be
.
A
brisk
,
satirical
spoof
of
contemporary
American
mores
entitled
``
An
American_Journey
''
was
given
its
first
New_York
performance
at
Hunter_College_Playhouse
last
night
by
the
Helen_Tamiris-Daniel_Nagrin_Dance_Company
.
Choreographed
by
Mr._Nagrin
,
the
work
filled
the
second_half
of
a
program
that
also
offered
the
first
New_York
showing
of
Miss_Tamiris
'
``
Once
Upon
a
Time
''
,
as_well
as
her
``
Women
's
Song
''
and
Mr._Nagrin
's
``
Indeterminate
Figure
''
.
Eugene_Lester
assembled
a
witty
and
explicit
score
for
``
An
American_Journey
''
,
and
Malcolm_McCormick
gave
it
sprightly
imaginative
costumes
.
Mr._Nagrin
has
described
four
``
places
''
,
each
with
its
scenery
and
people
,
added
two
``
diversions
''
,
and
concluded
with
``
A
Toccata
for
the
Young
''
,
a
refreshingly
underplayed
interpretation
of
rock
'
n
'
roll
dancing
.
The
``
places
''
could
be
anywhere
,
the
idiosyncrasies
and
foibles
observed
there
could
be
anybody
's
,
and
the
laugh
is
on
us
all
.
But
we
need
not
mind
too_much
,
because
Mr._Nagrin
has
expressed
it
through
movement
that
is
diverting
and
clever
almost
all_the_way
.
Miss_Tamiris
'
``
Once
Upon
a
Time
''
is
a
problem
piece
about
a
man
and
a
woman
and
the
three
``
figures
''
that
bother
them
somehow
.
Unfortunately
,
the
man
and
woman
were
not
made
to
appear
very
interesting
at
the
outset
and
the
menacing
figures
failed
to
make
them
any_more
so
.
Nor
did
the
dancing
involved
really
seize
the
attention
at_any_time
.
The
music
here
,
Russell_Smith
's
``
Tetrameron
''
,
sounded
good
.
All
the
performances
of
the
evening
were
smooth
and
assured
,
and
the
sizable
company
,
with
Mr._Nagrin
and
Marion_Scott
as
its
leading
dancers
,
seemed
to
be
fine
shape
.
The
Symphony
of
the
Air
,
greatly
assisted
by
Van_Cliburn
,
last
night
got
its
seven-concert
Beethoven
cycle
at
Carnegie_Hall
off
to
a
good
start
.
At_the_same_time
the
orchestra
announced
that
next
season
it
would
be
giving
twenty-five
programs
at
Carnegie
,
and
that
it
would
be
taking
these
concerts
to
the
suburbs
,
repeating
each
of
them
in
five
different
communities
.
This
news
,
announced
by
Jerome_Toobin
,
the
orchestra
's
administrative
director
,
brought
applause
from
the
2800
persons
who
filled
the
hall
.
They
showed
they
were
glad
that
Carnegie
would
have
a
major
orchestra
playing
there
so
often
next
season
to
take_up
the
slack
with
the
departure
to
Lincoln_Center
of
the
New_York
Philharmonic
,
the
Philadelphia_Orchestra
and
the
Boston_Symphony
.
This
season
the
orchestra
has
already
taken
a
step
toward
the
suburbs
in_that
it
is
giving
six
subscription
concerts
for
the
Orchestral_Society
of
Westchester
in
the
County_Center
in
White_Plains
.
The
details
of
the
suburban
concerts
next
season
,
and
the
centers
in_which
they
will
be
given
,
will
be
announced
later
,
Mr._Toobin
said
.
The
concertos
that
Van_Cliburn
has
been
associated
with
in
New_York
since
his
triumphant
return
from
Russia
in
1958
have
been
the
Tchaikovsky
,
the
Rachmaninoff_Third
,
and
the
Prokofieff_Third
.
It
was
pleasant
last
night
,
therefore
,
to
hear
him
do
something
else
:
a
concerto
he
has
recently
recorded
,
``
The
Emperor
''
.
The
young
Texas
pianist
can
make
great
chords
ring_out
as_well
as
anyone
,
so
last
night
the
massive
sonorities
of_this
challenging
concerto
were
no
hazard
to
him
.
But
they
were
not
what
distinguished
his
performance
.
The
elements
that
did
were
the
introspective
slow
movement
,
the
beautiful
transition
to
the
third
movement
,
and
the
passages
of
filigree
that
laced
through
the
bigger
moments
of
the
opening
movement
and
the
final
Rondo
.
Mr._Cliburn
gave
the
slow
movement
some
of
the
quality
of
a
Chopin_Nocturne
.
Alfred_Wallenstein
,
the
conductor
,
sensitive
accompanist
that
he
is
,
picked_up
the
idea
and
led
the
orchestra
here
with
a
sense
of
broodinf
,
poetic
mystery
.
The
collaboration
was
remarkable
,
as
it
was
in
both
the
other
movements
,
too
.
Mr._Wallenstein
,
who
will
lead
all_of
the
concerts
in
the
cycle
,
also
conducted
the
``
Leonore
''
Overture
No.
3
and
the
Fourth_Symphony
.
The
orchestra
was
obviously
on
its
mettle
and
it
played
most
responsively
.
And
although
there
was
plenty
of
vigor
in
the
performance
,
the
ensemble
was
at
its
best
when
the
playing
was
soft
and
lyrical
,
yet
full_of
the
suppressed
tension
that
is
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
Beethoven
.
Igor_Oistrakh
will
be
the
next
soloist
on
Feb.
4
.
There
are
times
when
one
suspects
that
the
songs
that
are
dropped
from
musical
shows
before
they
reach
Broadway
may
really
be
better
than
many_of
those
that
are_left
in
.
Today
,
in
the
era
of
the
integrated
musical
when
an
individual
song
must
contribute
to
the
over-all
development
of
the
show
,
it
is
understandable
that
a
song
,
no_matter_how
excellent
it
may
be
on
its
own
terms
,
is
cut_out
because
it
does
not
perform
the
function
required
of_it
.
In
the
more
casually
constructed
musicals
of
the
Nineteen
Twenties
and
Nineteen
Thirties
there
would
seem
to
have
been
less
reason
for
eliminating
a
song
of
merit
.
Yet
there
is
the
classic
case
of
the
Gershwins
'
``
The_Man_I_Love
''
.
Deemed
too
static
when
it
was
first
heard
in
``
Lady
Be
Good
''
in
Philadelphia
in
1924
,
it
was
dropped
from
the
score
.
It
was
heard
again
in
Philadelphia
in
1927
in
the
first
version
of
``
Strike_Up
the
Band
''
and
again
abandoned
shortly
before
the
entire
show
was
given_up
.
It
finally
reached
Broadway
in
the
second
and
successful
version
of
``
Strike_Up
the
Band
''
in
1929
.
(
Still
another
song
in
``
Strike_Up
the
Band
''
-
``
I
've_Got_a_Crush_on_You
''
-
was
retrieved
from
a
1928
failure
,
``
Treasure_Girl
''
)
.
Like
the
Gershwins
,
Richard_Rodgers
and
Lorenz_Hart
were
loath
to
let
a
good
song
get_away
from
them
.
If
one
of
Mr._Rodgers
'
melodies
seemed
to
deserve
a
better
fate
than
interment
in
Boston
or
the
obscurity
of
a
Broadway
failure
,
Mr._Hart
was
likely
to
deck
it
out
with
new
lyrics
to
give
it
a
second
chance
in
another
show
.
Several
of
these
double_entries
have
been
collected
by
Ben_Bagley
and
Michael_McWhinney
,
along
with
Rodgers
and
Hart
songs
that
disappeared
permanently
en_route
to
New_York
and_others
that
reached
Broadway
but
have
not
become
part
of
the
constantly
heard
Rodgers
and
Hart
repertory
,
in
a
delightfully
refreshing
album
,
Rodgers
and
Hart_Revisited
(
Spruce
Records
,
505
Fifth_Avenue
,
New_York
)
.
Among
the
particular
gems
in_this
collection
is
the
impudent
opening
song
of
``
The
Garrick
Gaieties
''
,
an
impressive
forecast
of
the
wit
and
melody
that
were
to
come
from
Rodgers
and
Hart
in
the
years
that
followed
;
Dorothy_Loudon
's
raucous
listing
of
the
attractions
``
At
the
Roxy
Music_Hall
''
from
``
I
Married
an
Angel
''
;
and
the
incisive
style
with
which
Charlotte_Rae
delivers
the
top-drawer
Hart
lyrics
of
``
I
Blush
''
,
a
song
that
was
cut
from
``
A
Connecticut_Yankee
''
.
Altogether
fifteen
virtually
unknown
Rodgers
and
Hart
songs
are
sung
by
a
quintet
of
able
vocalists
.
Norman_Paris
has
provided
them
with
extremely
effective
orchestral
accompaniment
Turning_to
the
current
musical
season
on
Broadway
,
the_most
widely
acclaimed
of
the
new
arrivals
,
How_to_Succeed_in_Business_Without_Really_Trying
,
has
been
transferred
to
an
original
cast
album
(
R._C._A._Victor_LOC
1066
;
stereo
LSO
1066
)
that
has
some
entertaining
moments
,
although
it
is
scarcely
as
inventive
as
the
praise
elicited
by
the
show
might
lead
one
to
expect
.
Robert_Morse
,
singing
with
comically
plaintive
earnestness
,
carries
most_of
the
burden
and
is
responsible_for
the
high
spots
in
Frank_Loesser
's
score
.
Rudy_Vallee
,
who
shares
star
billing
with
Mr._Morse
,
makes
only
two
appearances
.
He
shares
with
Mr._Morse
a
parody
of
the
college
anthems
he
once
sang
while
his
second
song
is
whisked_away
from
him
by
Virginia_Martin
,
a
girl
with
a
remarkably
expressive
yip
in
her
voice
.
In_general
,
Mr._Loesser
has
done
a
more
consistent
job
as
lyricist
than
he
has
as
composer
.
Like
Mr._Loesser
,
Jerry_Herman
is
both
composer
and
lyriist
for
Milk
and
Honey
(
R._C._A._Victor_LOC
1065
;
stereo
LSO
1065
)
,
but
in_this
case
it
is
the
music
that
stands
above
the
lyrics
.
For
this
story
of
an
American
couple
who
meet
and
fall_in_love
in
Israel
,
Mr._Herman
has
written
songs
that
are
warmly
melodious
and
dance_music
that
sparkles
.
There
are
the
full-bodied
,
resourceful
voices
of
Robert_Weede
,
Mimi_Benzell
and
Tommy_Rall
to
make
the
most
of
Mr._Herman
's
lilting
melodies
and
,
for
an
occasional
change
of
pace
,
the
bright
humor
of
Molly_Picon
.
Mr._Herman
has
managed
to
mix
musical
ideas
drawn
from
Israel
and
the
standard
American
ballad
style
in
a
manner
that
stresses
the
basic
tunefulness
of
both
idioms
.
Not
content
to
create
only
the
music
and
lyrics
,
Noe
^
l
Coward
also
wrote
the
book
and
directed
Sail
Away
(
Capitol_WAO
1643
;
stereo
SWAO
1643
)
,
a
saga
of
life
on
a
cruise_ship
that
is
not
apt
to
be
included
among
Mr._Coward
's
more
memorable
works
.
The
melodies
flow
along
pleasantly
,
as
Mr._Coward
's
songs
usually
do
,
but
his
lyrics
have
a
tired
,
cut-to-a-familiar-pattern
quality
.
Elaine_Stritch
,
who
sings
with
a
persuasively
warm
huskiness
,
belts
some
life
into
most_of
her
songs
,
but
the
other
members
of
the
cast
sound
as
lukewarm
as
Mr._Coward
's
songs
.
With
three
fine
Russian
films
in
recent
months
on
World_War
2
,
-
``
The_House_I_Live_In
''
,
``
The_Cranes_Are_Flying
''
and
``
Ballad
of
a
Soldier
''
-
we
had
every
right
to
expect
a
real
Soviet
block-buster
in
``
The
Day
the
War_Ended
''
.
It
simply
is
n't
,
not_by_a_long_shot
.
The
Artkino
presentation
,
with
English
titles
,
opened
on
Saturday
at
the
Cameo_Theatre
.
Make
no
mistake
,
this
Gorky_Studio
drama
is
a
respectable
import
-
aptly
grave
,
carefully
written
,
performed
and
directed
.
In
describing
the
initial
Allied
occupation
of
a
middle-sized
German
city
,
the
picture
has
color
,
pictorial
pull
and
genuinely
moving
moments
.
Told
strictly
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
Russian
conquerors
,
the
film
compassionately
peers
over
the
shoulders
of
a
smitten
Soviet
couple
,
at
both
sides
of
the
conflict
's
aftermath
.
Unfortunately
,
the
whole
picture
hinges_on
this
romance
,
at
the
expense
of
everything
else
.
Tenderly
and
rather
tediously
,
the
camera
rivets
on
the
abrupt
,
deep
love
of
a
pretty
nurse
and
a
uniformed
teacher
,
complicated
by
nothing
more_than
a
friend
they
do
n't
want
to
hurt
.
It
's
the
old
story
,
war
or
no
war
,
and
more_than
one
viewer
may
recall
Hollywood
's
``
Titanic
''
,
several
seasons
back
,
when
the
paramount
concern
was
for
the
marital
discord
of
a
society
dilettante
.
Not
that
the
picture
is
superficial
.
Under
Yakov_Segal
's
direction
,
it
begins
stirringly
,
as
crouching
Soviet
and
Nazi
troops
silently
scan
each
other
,
waiting
for
the
first
surrender
gesture
.
One
high-up
camera
shot
is
magnificent
,
as
the
Germans
straggle
from
a
cathedral
,
dotting
a
huge
,
cobblestone
square
,
and
drop
their
weapons
.
