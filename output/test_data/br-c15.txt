As
autumn
starts
its
annual
sweep
,
few
Americans
and
Canadians
realize
how
fortunate
they
are
in
having
the
world
's
finest
fall
coloring
.
Spectacular
displays
of_this
sort
are
relatively
rare
in
the
entire
land
surface
of
the
earth
.
The
only
other
regions
so
blessed
are
the_British
Isles
,
western
Europe
,
eastern
China
,
southern
Chile
and
parts
of
Japan
,
New_Zealand
and
Tasmania
.
Their
autumn
tints
are
all
fairly
low
keyed
compared
with
the
fiery
stabs
of
crimson
,
gold
,
purple
,
bronze
,
blue
and
vermilion
that
flame_up
in
North_America
.
Jack_Frost
is
not
really
responsible_for
this
great
seasonal
spectacle
;
in_fact
,
a
freezing
autumn
dulls
the
blaze
.
The
best
effects
come
from
a
combination
of
temperate
climate
and
plenty
of
late-summer
rain
,
followed
by
sunny
days
and
cool
nights
.
Foliage
pilgrimages
,
either
organized
or
individual
,
are
becoming
an
autumn
item
for
more_and_more
Americans
each_year
.
Below
is
a
specific
guide
,
keyed
to
the
calendar
.
Late
September
finds
Quebec
's
color
at
its
peak
,
especially
in
the
Laurentian
hills
and
in
the
area
south
of
the
St._Lawrence_River
.
In
the
Maritime_provinces
farther
east
,
the
tones
are
a_little
quieter
.
Ontario
's
foliage
is
most
vivid
from
about
Sept.
23
to
Oct.
10
,
with
both
Muskoka
(
100
miles
north
of
Toronto
)
and
Haliburton
(
125
miles
northwest
of
Toronto
)
holding
color
cavalcades
starting
Sept.
23
.
In
the
Canadian
Rockies
,
great
groves
of
aspen
are
already
glinting
gold
.
Vermont
's
sugar_maples
are
scarlet
from
Sept.
25
to
Oct.
15
,
and
often
hit
a
height
in
early
October
.
New_Hampshire
figures
its
peak
around
Columbus_Day
and
boasts
of
all
its
hardwoods
including
the
yellow
of
the
birches
.
The
shades
tend
to
be
a_little
softer
in
the
forests
that
blanket
so_much
of
Maine
.
In
western
Massachusetts
and
northwest
Connecticut
,
the
Berkshires
are
at
their
vibrant
prime
the
first
week
of
October
.
The
Adirondacks
blaze
brightest
in
early
October
,
choice
routes
being
9
N
from
Saratoga
up_to
Lake_George
and
73
and
86
in
the
Lake_Placid
area
.
Farther
south
in
New_York
there
is
a
heavy
haze
of
color
over
the
Catskills
in
mid-October
,
notably
along
routes
23
and
23
A
.
About
the
same
time
the
Alleghenies
and
Poconos
in
Pennsylvania
are
magnificent
-
Renovo
holds
its
annual
Flaming
Foliage
Festival
on
Oct.
14
,

.
New_Jersey
's
color
varies
from
staccato
to
pastel
all_the_way
from
the
Delaware
Water_Gap
to
Cape_May
.
During
the
first_half
of
October
the_Blue
Ridge
and
other
parts
of
the
Appalachians
provide
a
spectacle
stretching
from
Maryland
and
West_Virginia
to
Georgia
.
The_most
brilliant
displays
are
along
the
Skyline_Drive
above
Virginia
's
Shenandoah_Valley
and
throughout
the
Great
Smokies
between
North_Carolina
and
Tennessee
.
Michigan
,
Wisconsin
and
Minnesota
have
many
superb
stretches
of
color
which
reach
their
height
from
the
last
few
days
of
September
well
into
October
,
especially
in
their
northern
sections
,
e._g.
,
Wisconsin
's
Vilas_County
whose
Colorama
celebration
is
Sept.
29
-
Oct
.8
.
In
Wisconsin
,
take
route
55
north
of
Shawano
or
routes
78
and
60
from
Portage
to
Prairie_du_Chien
.
In
Michigan
,
there
is
fine
color
on
route
27
up_to
the
Mackinac
Straits
,
while
the
views
around
Marquette
and
Iron_Mountain
in
the
Upper_Peninsula
are
spectacular
.
In
Minnesota
,
Arrowhead_County
and
route
53
north
to
International_Falls
are
outstanding
.
Farther
south
,
there
are
attractive
patches
all_the_way
to
the
Ozarks
,
with
some
seasonal
peaks
as
late
as
early
November
.
Illinois
'
Shawnee_National_Forest
,
Missouri
's
Iron_County
and
the
maples
of
Hiawatha
,
Kan.
should
be
at
their
best
in
mid-October
.
The
Rockies
have
many
``
Aspencades
''
,
which
are
organized
tours
of
the
aspen
areas
with
frequent
stops
at
vantage_points
for
viewing
the
golden
panoramas
.
In
Colorado
,
Ouray
has
its
Fall_Color_Week_Sept.
22
-

Rye
and

both
sponsor
Aspencades
Sept.

Two
sharply
contrasting
places
designed
for
public
enjoyment
are
now
on
display
.
The
Corn
Palace
at
Mitchell
,
S._Dak.
,
``
the
world
's
corniest
building
''
,
has
a
carnival
through
Sept.
23
headlining
the
Three
Stooges
and
Pee_Wee_Hunt
.
Since
1892
ears
of
red
,
yellow
,
purple
and
white
corn
have
annually
been
nailed
to
11
big
picture
panels
to
create
hugh
``
paintings
''
.
The
1961
theme
is
the
Dakota_Territorial_Centennial
,
with
the
pictures
including
the
Lewis
and
Clark
expedition
,
the
first
river
steamboat
,
the
1876
gold_rush
,
a_little
red
schoolhouse
on
the
prairie
,
and
today
's
construction
of
large
Missouri_River
reservoirs
.
The
panels
will
stay
up
until
they
are
replaced
next
summer
.
Longwood_Gardens
,
near
Kennett_Square
,
Pa.
(
about
12
miles
from
Wilmington
,
Del
.
)
,
was
developed
and
heavily
endowed
by
the
late
Pierre_S._du_Pont
.
Every
Wednesday
night
through
Oct.
11
there
will
be
an
elaborate
colored
fountain
display
,
with
229
nozzles
throwing
jets
of
water
up_to
130
feet
.
The
``
peacock
tail
''
nozzle
throws
a
giant
fan
of
water
100
feet
wide
and
40
feet
high
.
The
gardens
themselves
are
open
free_of_charge
the
year
round
,
and
the
192
permanent
employes
make
sure
that
not
a
dead
or
wilted
flower
is
ever
seen
indoors
or
out
by
any
visitor
.
The
greenhouses
alone
cover
3
-
1
2
acres
.
Carson_McCullers
,
after
a
long
,
painful
illness
that
might
have
crushed
a
less-indomitable
soul
,
has
come_back
with
an
absolute
gem
of
a
novel
which
jumped
high
on
best-seller
lists
even
before
official
publication
.
Though
the
subject
-
segregation
in
her
native
South
-
has
been
thoroughly
worked
,
Miss_McCullers
uses
her
poet
's
instinct
and
storyteller
's
skill
to
reaffirm
her
place
at
the
very
top
of
modern
American
writing
.
With
an
art
that
almost
conceals
art
,
J._D._Salinger
can
create
a
fictional
world
so
authentic
that
it
hurts
.
Here
,
in
the_most
eagerly
awaited
novel
of
the
season
(
his
first
since
The
Catcher
in
the
Rye
)
,
he
tells
of
a
college_girl
in
flight
from
the
life
around
her
and
the
tart
but
sympathetic
help
she
gets
from
her
25
-
year-old
brother
.
Althea_Urn
.
A
deft
,
hilarious
satire
on
very
high
French
society
involving
a
statesman
with
two
enviable
possessions
,
a
lovely
young
bride
and
a
head
containing
such
weighty
thoughts
that
he
has
occasionally
to
remove
it
for
greater
comfort
.
There
is
probably
a
moral
in_all
this
about
``
mind
vs.
heart
''
.
Virgilia_Peterson
,
a
critic
by
trade
,
has
turned
her
critical
eye
pitilessly
and
honestly
on
herself
in
an
autobiography
more
of
the
mind
and
heart
than
of
specific
events
.
It
is
an
engrossing
commentary
on
a
repressive
,
upper-middle-class
New_York
way_of_life
in
the
first
part
of_this
century
.
This
retelling
by
Louis_Zara
of
the
brief
,
anguished
life
of
Stephen_Crane
-
poet
and
master
novelist
at
23
,
dead
at
28

is
in
novelized
form
but
does
not
abuse
its
tragic
subject

This
French
film
,
set
in
Italy
,
is
a
summertime
splurge
in
shock
and
terror
all
shot
in
lovely
sunny
scenery

so
breath-taking
that
at_times
you
almost

the
horrors

criminal

Of
the
nation
's
eight
million
pleasure-boat
owners
a
sizable
number
have
learned
that
late
autumn
is
one
of
the
loveliest
seasons
to
be
afloat
-
at_least
in_that
broad
balmy
region
that
lies
below
America
's
belt
line
.
Waterways
are
busy
right_now
from
the
Virginia
capes
to
the
Texas
coast
.
There
true
yachtsmen
often
find
November
winds
steadier
,
the
waters_cooler
,
the
fish
hungrier
,
and
rivers
more
pleasant
-
less
turbulence
and
mud
,
and
fewer
floating
logs
.
More_and_more
boats
move
overland
on
wheels
(
1.8
million
trailers
are
now
in_use

and
Midwesterners
taking
long
weekends
can
travel
south
with
their
craft

In
the
Southwest
,
the
fall
brings_out
flotillas
of
boatsmen
who
find
the
summer
too
hot
for
comfort
.
And
on
northern
shores
indomitable
sailors
from
Long_Island
to
Lake_Michigan
will
beat
around
the
buoys
in
dozens
of
frostbite
races
.
Some
