She
was
just
another
freighter
from
the
States
,
and
she
seemed
as
commonplace
as
her
name
.
She
was
the
John_Harvey
,
one
of
those
Atlantic
sea-horses
that
had
sailed
to
Bari
to
bring
beans
,
bombs
,
and
bullets
to
the
U._S._Fifteenth
Air_Force
,
to
Field_Marshal
Montgomery
's
Eighth_Army
then
racing
up
the
calf
of
the
boot
of
Italy
in_that
early
December
of
1943
.
The
John_Harvey
arrived
in
Bari
,
a
port
on
the
Adriatic
,
on
November
28
th
,
making
for
Porto_Nuovo
,
which
,
as
the
name
indicates
,
was
the
ancient
city
's
new
and
modern
harbor
.
Hardly
anyone
ashore
marked
her
as
she
anchored
stern-to
off
Berth
29
on
the
mole
.
If
anyone
thought_of
the
John_Harvey
,
it
was
to
observe
that
she
was
straddled
by
a
pair
of
ships
heavily
laden
with
high_explosive
and
if
they
were
hit
the
John_Harvey
would
likely
be
blown_up
with
her
own
ammo
and
whatever
else
it
was
that
she
carried
.
Which
was
poison_gas
.
It
had
required
the
approval
of
President
Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt
before
the
John_Harvey
could
be
loaded
with
100
tons
of
mustard_gas
and
despatched
to
the
Italian
warfront
.
For
in
a
world
as_yet
unacquainted_with
the
horrors
of
the
mushroom_cloud
,
poison_gas
was
still
regarded_as
the
ultimate
in
hideous
weapons
.
Throughout
the
early
years
of
World_War
2
,
,
reports
persisted
that
the
Axis
powers
had
used
gas
-
Germany
in
Russia
,
Japan
in
China
again
.
They
were
always
denied
.
Influential
people
in
America
were
warning
the
Pentagon
to
be
prepared
against
desperation
gas
attacks
by
the
Germans
in
future
campaigns
.
Some
extremists
went
so_far
as
to
urge
our
using
it
first
.
To
silence
extremists
,
to
warn
the
Axis
,
President_Roosevelt
issued
this
statement
for
the
Allies
in
August
:
``
From_time_to_time
since
the
present
war
began
there
have
been
reports
that
one
or
more
of
the
Axis
powers
were
seriously
contemplating
use
of
poisonous
gas
or
noxious
gases
or
other
inhumane
devices
of
warfare
.
I
have
been
loath
to
believe
that
any
nation
,
even
our
present
enemies
,
could
or
would
be
willing
to
loose
upon
mankind
such
terrible
and
inhumane
weapons
.
``
However
,
evidence
that
the
Axis
powers
are
making
significant
preparations
indicative_of
such
an
intention
is
being
reported
with
increasing
frequency
from
a
variety
of
sources
.
``
Use
of
such
weapons
has
been
outlawed
by
the
general
opinion
of
civilized
mankind
.
This
country
has
not
used
them
,
and
I
hope
that
we
never
will
be
compelled
to
use
them
.
I
state
categorically
that
we
shall
under
no
circumstances
resort
to
the
use
of
such
weapons
unless
they
are
first
used
by
our
enemies
''
.
The
following
month
the
invasion
of
Italy
was
begun
,
and
Roosevelt
gave
effect
to
his
warning
by
consenting
to
the
stockpiling
of
poison_gas
in
southern
Italy
.
Bari
was
chosen
as
a
depot
,
not_only
for
its
seeming
safety
,
but
because
of
its
proximity
to
airfields
.
Any
retaliatory
gas
attack
would
be
airborne
.
It
would
be
made
in
three
waves
-
the
first
to
lay_down
a
smokescreen
,
the
second
to
drop
the
gas
bombs
,
the
third
to
shower
incendiaries
which
would
burn
everything
below
.
So
the
vile
cargo
went_into
the
hole
of
the
John_Harvey
.
A
detachment
of
six
men
from
the
701
st
Chemical_Maintenance_Company
under
First_Lt._Howard_D._Beckstrom
went
aboard
,
followed
by
Lt._Thomas_H._Richardson
,
the
Cargo_Security_Officer
.
Secrecy
was
paramount
.
Only
a_few
other
people
-
very
important
people
-
knew
of
the
nitrogen-mustard
eggs
nestled
below
decks
.
No
one
else
must
know
.
Thus
,
in
the
immemorial
way
-
in
the
way
of
the
right_hand
that
knows
and
the
left
that
does
not
-
was
the
stage
set
for
tragedy
at
Bari
.
It
was
the
night
of
December
2
,
1943
,
and
it
was
growing
dark
in
Bari
.
It
was
getting_on
toward
7
o
'
clock
and
the
German
Me-210
plane
had
been
and
gone
on
its
eighth
straight
visit
.
Capt._A._B._Jenks
of
the
Office
of
Harbor_Defense
was
very
worried
.
He
knew
that
German
long-range
bombers
had
been
returning
to
the
attack
in
Italy
.
On
November
24
th
,
they
had
made
a
raid
on
La_Maddalena
.
Two
days
later
,
some
30
of
them
had
struck
at
a
convoy
off
Bougie
,
sinking
a
troopship
-
and
it
had
been
that
very
night
that
the
Me-210
had
made
its
first_appearance
.
After
it
had
reappeared
the
next
two
nights
,
Jenks
went_to
higher
headquarters
and
said
:
``
For
three
days
now
a
German
reconnaissance
plane
has
been
over
the
city
taking
pictures
.
They
're
just
waiting
for
the
proper
time
to
come
over_here
and
dump
this
place
into
the
Adriatic
''
.
But
the
older
and
wiser
heads
had
dismissed
his
warning
as
alarmist
.
Even_though
it
was
known
that
the
Luftwaffe
in_the_north
was
now
being
directed
by
the
young
and
energetic
General_Peltz
,
the
commander
who
would
conduct
the
``
Little_Blitz
''
on
London
in
1944
,
a
major
raid
on
Bari
at
this
juncture
of
the
war
was
not
to
be
considered
seriously
.
True
,
there
had
been
raids
on
Naples
-
but
Naples
was
pretty
far
north
on
the
opposite
coast
.
No
,
Bari
was
out
of
range
.
More_than
that
,
Allied
air
had
complete
superiority
in
the
Eighth_Army
's
sector
.
So
Captain_Jenks
returned
to
his
harbor
post
to
watch
the
scouting
plane
put_in
five
more
appearances
,
and
to
feel
the
certainty
of_this
dread
rising
within
him
.
For
Jenks
knew
that
Bari
's
defenses
were
made
of
paper
.
The
Royal
Air_Force
had
but
a
single
light
anti-aircraft
squadron
and
two
balloon
units
available
.
There
were
no
R._A._F.
fighter
squadrons
on
Bari
airfield
.
The
radar
station
with
the
best
location
was
still
not
serviceable
.
Telephone
communication
was
bad
.
And
everywhere
in_evidence
among
the
few
remaining
defensive
units
was
that
old
handmaiden
of
disaster
-
multiple
command
.
It
had
been
made
shockingly
evident
that
very
morning
to
Ensign_Kay_K._Vesole
,
in
charge
of
the
armed
guard
aboard
the
John_Bascom
.
A
British
officer
had
come
aboard
and
told
him
that
in_case
of
enemy
air_attack
he
was
not
to
open_fire
until
bombs
were
actually
dropped
.
Then
he
was
to
co-ordinate
his
fire
with
a
radar-controlled
shore
gun
firing
white
tracers
.
``
This
harbor
is
a
bomber
's
paradise
''
,
the
Britisher
had
said
with
frank
grimness
.
``
It
's
up_to
you
to
protect
yourselves
.
We
can
n't
expect
any
help
from
the
fighters
at
Foggia
,
either
.
They
're
all
being
used
on
offensive
missions
''
.
Vesole
had
been
stunned
.
Not
fire
until
the
bombs
came_down
!
He
thought_of
the
tons
and
tons
of
flammable
fluid
beneath
his
feet
and
shook
his
head
.
Like_hell
!
Like_hell
he
'd
wait
-
and
supposing
the
radar-controlled
gun
got
knocked_out
?
What
would
his
guns
guide_on
then
-
the
North_Star
?
Ensign_Vesole
decided
that
he
would
not
tarry
until
he
heard
the
whispering
of
the
bombs
,
and
when
night
began
to
fall
,
he
put
Seaman
2
/
c
Donald_L._Norton
and
Seaman
1
/
c
William_A._Rochford
on
the
guns
and
told
them
to
start
shooting
the
moment
they
saw
an
enemy
silhouette
.
Below
decks
,
Seaman
1
/
c
Stanley_Bishop
had
begun
to
write
a
letter
home
.
Above
decks
on
the
John_Harvey
,
Lieutenant_Richardson
gazed
at
the
lights
still
burning
on
the
port
wall
and
felt
uneasy
.
There
were
lights
glinting
in
the
city
,
too
,
even_though
it
was
now
dark
enough
for
a_few
stars
to
become
visible
.
Bari
was
asking_for_it
,
he
thought
.
For
five
days
now
,
they
had
been
in
port
and
that
filthy
stuff
was
still
in
the
hold
.
Richardson
wondered
when
it
would
be
unloaded
.
He
hoped
they
would
put
it
somewhere
way
,
way
down
in
the
earth
.
The
burden
of
his
secret
was
pressing_down_on
him
,
as
it
was_on
Lieutenant_Beckstrom
and
his
six
enlisted_men
.
Lieutenant_Richardson
could
envy
the
officers
and
men
of
the
John_Harvey
in
their
innocent
assumption
that
the
ship
contained
nothing
more
dangerous
than
high_explosive
bombs
.
They
seemed
happy
at
the
delay
in
unloading
,
glad
at
the
chance
to
go
ashore
in
a
lively
liberty
port
such_as
Bari
.
Nine
of
them
had
gone
down
the
gangplank
already
.
Deck_Cadet_James_L._Cahill
and
Seaman_Walter_Brooks
had
been
the
first
to
leave
.
Richardson
had
returned
their
departing
grins
with
the
noncommittal
nod
that
is
the
security
officer
's
stock
in
trade
.
The
other
half
of
the
crew
,
plus
Beckstrom
and
his
men
,
had
remained
aboard
.
Richardson
glanced
to
sea
and
started
slightly
.
Damned
if
that
was
n't
a
sailing_ship
standing_out
of
the
old
harbor
-
Porto_Vecchio
.
The
night
was
so
clear
that
Richardson
had
no
difficulty
making_out
the
silhouette
.
Then
the
thought
of
a
cloudless
sky
made
him
shiver
,
and
he
glanced
upward
.
His
eyes
boggled
.
It
was
a
clear
night
and
it
was
raining
!
Capt._Michael_A._Musmanno
,
Military_governor
of
the
Sorrentine_Peninsula
,
had
also
seen
and
felt
the
``
rain
''
.
But
he
had
mistaken
it
for
bugs
.
Captain_Musmanno
's
renovated
schooner
with
the
flamboyant
name
Unsinkable
had
just
left
Porto_Vecchio
with
a
cargo
of
badly-needed
olive_oil
for
the
Sorrentine
's
civilian
population
.
Musmanno
was
on
deck
.
At
exactly
7
:
30
,
he
felt
a
fluttering
object
brush
his
face
.
He
snatched
at
it
savagely
.
He
turned
the
beam
of
his
flashlight
on_it
.
He
laughed
.
It
was
the
silver
foil
from
the
chocolate_bar
he
had
been
eating
.
He
frowned
.
But
how
could
-
?
Another
,
longer
strip
of
tinsel
whipped
his
mouth
.
It
was
two
feet
long
.
It
was
not
candy
wrapping
.
It
was
``
window
''
-
the
tinsel
paper
dropped
by
bombers
to
jam
radar
sets
,
to
fill
the
scope
with
hundreds
of
blips
that
would
seem
to
be
approaching
bombers
.
``
Fermate
''
!
Musmanno
bellowed
to
his
Italian
crewmen
.
``
Stop
!
Stop
the
engines
''
!
Unsinkable
slowed
and
stopped
,
hundreds
of
brilliant
white
flares
swayed
eerily
down
from
the
black
,
the
air_raid
sirens
ashore
rose
in
a
keening
shriek
,
the
anti-aircraft
guns
coughed
and
chattered
-
and
above
it
all
motors
roared
and
the
bombs
came
whispering
and
wailing
and
crashing
down
among
the
ships
at
anchor
at
Bari
.
They
had
come
from
airports
in
the_Balkans
,
these
hundred-odd
Junkers
88
's
.
They
had
winged
over
the
Adriatic
,
they
had
taken
Bari
by
complete
surprise
and
now
they
were
battering
her
,
attacking
with
deadly
skill
.
They
had
ruined
the
radar
warning
system
with
their
window
,
they
had
made
themselves
invisible
above
their
flares
.
And
they
also
had
the
lights
of
the
city
,
the
port
wall
lanterns
,
and
a
shore
crane
's
spotlight
to
guide_on
.
After
the
first
two
were
blacked_out
,
the
third
light
was
abandoned
by
a
terrified
Italian
crew
,
who
left
their
light
to
shine
for
nine
minutes
like
an
unerring
homing
beacon
until
British
MP
's
shot
it
out
.
In_that
interval
,
the
German
bombers
made
a
hell
of
Bari
harbor
.
Merchant_ships
illuminated
in
the
light
of
the
flares
,
made
to
seem
like
stones
imbedded
in
a
lake
of
polished
mud
,
were
impossible
to
miss
.
The
little
Unsinkable
sank
almost
immediately
.
Captain_Musmanno
roared
at
his
men
to
lash
three
of
the
casks
of
olive_oil
together
for
a
raft
.
They
got
it
over
the
side
and
clambered
aboard
only
a_few
minutes
before
their
schooner
went_under
.
John_Bascom
went_down
early
,
too
.
Ensign_Vesole
and
his
gunners
had
fought
valiantly
,
but
they
had
no
targets
.
Most_of
the
Junkers
were
above
the
blinding
light
of
the
flares
,
and
the
radar-controlled
shore
gun
had
been
knocked_out
by
one
of
the
first
sticks
of
bombs
.
Vesole
rushed
from
gun
to
gun
,
attempting
to
direct
fire
.
He
was
wounded
,
but
fought
on
.
Norton
and
Rochford
fired
wildly
at
the
sounds
of
the
motors
.
Bishop
rushed
on
deck
to
grab
a
20
mm
gun
,
pumping
out
400
rounds
before
sticks
of
three
bombs
each
crashed
into
Holds
One
,
Three
and
Five
.
Now
the
Bascom
was
mortally
wounded
.
Luckily
,
she
was
not
completely
aflame
and
would
go_down
before
the
gasoline
could
erupt
.
The
order
to
abandon
ship
was
given
,
but
cries
of
pain
could
be
heard
from
the
wounded
below
decks
.
