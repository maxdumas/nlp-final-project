You
have
heard
him
tell
these
young
people
that
during
his
almost
50
years
of
service
in
the
Congress
he
has
seen
the
Kaisers
and
the
Hitlers
and
the
Mussolinis
,
the
Tojos
and
Stalins
and
Khrushchevs
,
come
and
go
and
that
we
are
passing_on
to
them
the
freest
Nation
that
mankind
has
ever
known
.
Then
I
have
seen
the
pride
of
country
well
in
the
eyes
of
these
young
people
.
So
,
I
say
,
Mr._Speaker
,
God
bless
you
and
keep
you
for
many
years
not_only
for
this
body
but
for
the
United_States_of_America
and
the
free_world
.
You
remember
the
words
of
President_Kennedy
a
week
or_so
ago
,
when
someone
asked
him
when
he
was
in
Canada
,
and
Dean_Rusk
was
in
Europe
,
and
Vice_President
Johnson
was
in
Asia
,
``
Who
is_running
the
store
''
?
and
he
said
``
The
Same
fellow
who
has
been_running
it
,
Sam_Rayburn
''
.
Mr._Speaker
,
I
ask
unanimous
consent
that
all
Members
who
desire
to
do
so
may
extend
their
remarks
at
this
point
in
the
Record
;
and
also
that
they
may
have
5
legislative
days
in_which
to
extend
their
remarks
.
Is
there
objection
to
the
request
of
the
gentleman
from
Massachusetts
?
There
was
no
objection
.
It
is
notably
significant
that
so
many
Members
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
express
their
respect
and
admiration
for
our
beloved
Speaker
,
the
Honorable_Sam_Rayburn
.
I
purposely
refrained_from
adding
the
usual
distinction
of
saying
that
he
was
from
the
State
of
Texas
.
I
did
so
because
I
agree
with
so
many
here
today
,
that
he
is
the
beloved
Speaker
of
all
the
people
of
the
United_States
.
For
the
dignity
,
the
influence
,
and
the
power
of
the
legislative
branch
of
our
Government
-
it
is
a
privilege
for
us
to
do
honor
to
this
great
man
who
represents
not
alone
his
own
district
but
all
the
people
of
our
country
.
To
honor
him
is
to
honor
ourselves
.
In_this
my
first
year
as
a
Member
of_this
body
I
have
experienced
many
memorable
moments
.
Many_of
these
experiences
are
so
important
that
they
will
be
cherished
forever
by
me
.
And
,
like
many_of
you
here
present
,
I
hold
as
the
highlight
of
all
,
the
occasion
of
my
first
meeting
with
the
honorable
Speaker
of
the
House
.
At_that_time
,
he
afforded
me
the
courtesy
of
his
busy
workday
for
such
length
as
I
may
need
,
to
speak
about
my
background
,
my
hopes
,
my
views
on
various
national
and
local
topics
,
and
any
problems
that
I
may
have
been
vexed
with
at_the_time
.
He
was
fatherly
in
his
handling
of
all
subjects
with
me
and
tremendously
wise
in
his
counsel
.
In_conclusion
,
he
wished
me
well
-
and
as
kindly
and
humbly
as
this
humane
gentleman
could
express
himself
,
he
asked
to
be_remembered
to
my
wife
and
children
.
In
my
short
period
here
I
believe
that
at_no_time
has
he
been
otherwise
than
the_most
popular
man
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
.
He
is
most
effective
in
the
ordinary
business
of
the
House
,
and
in
the
legislative
accomplishments
of_this
session
,
he
easily
rose
to
great
occasion
-
even
at
the
height
of
unpleasantness
and
exciting
legislative
struggle
-
and
as
the
Nation
witnessed
these
contests
,
he
rose
,
even
as
admitted
by
those
who
differed
with
him
,
to
the
proportions
of
a
hero
and
a
noble
partisan
.
I
am
highly
privileged
today
to
commemorate
the
brilliant
career
of_this
parliamentary
giant
.
He
will
ever
be
my
example
as
a
true
statesman
;
one
who
is
thoroughly
human
,
who
affects
no
dignity
,
and
who
is
endowed_with
real
ability
,
genuine
worth
,
and
sterling
honesty
-
all
dedicated_to
secure
the
best
interests
of
the
country
he
has
loved
and
served
so_long
.
May
the
Divine_Speaker
in
Heaven
bless
this
country
with
Sam_Rayburn
's
continued
service
here
for
years
to
come
.
It
is
a
matter
of
deep
personal
satisfaction
for
me
to
add
my
voice
to
the
great
and
distinguished
chorus
of
my
colleagues
in_this
paean
of
praise
,
respect
,
and
affection
for
Speaker_Sam_Rayburn
.
In_this
hour
of
crisis
,
the
wisdom
,
the
dedication
,
the
stabilizing
force
that
he
represents
in
current
American
government
is
an
almost
indispensable
source
of
strength
.
He
has
become
in_this
half
century
the
grand
old_man
of
American
history
.
It
seems
to
me
that
the
prayers
of
the
whole
free_world
must
rise
like
some
vast
petition
to
Providence
that
Sam_Rayburn
's
vigor
and
his
life
remain
undiminished
through
the
coming
decades
.
Here
briefly
in_this
humble
tribute
I
have
sought
for
some
simple
and
succinct
summation
that
would
define
the
immense
service
of_this
patriot
to
his
country
.
But
the
task
is
beyond
me
because
I
hold
it
impossible
to
compress
in
a
sentence
or
two
the
complicated
and
prodigious
contributions
Sam_Rayburn
has
made
as
an
individual
,
as
a
legislator
,
as
a
statesman
and
as
a
leader
and
conciliator
,
to
the
majestic
progress
of_this
Nation
.
It
happens
that
I
am
a
legislator
from
Ohio
and
that
I
feel
deeply
about
the
needs
,
the
aspirations
,
the
interests
of
my
district
and
my
State
.
What
Sam_Rayburn
's
life
proves
to
us
all
is
the
magnificent
lesson
in
political_science
that
one
can
devotedly
and
with
absolute
dedication
represent
the
seemingly
provincial
interests
of
one
's
own
community
,
one
's
own
district
,
one
's
own
State
,
and
by
that
help
himself
represent
even
better
the
sweep
and
scope
of
the
problems
of_this
the
greatest
nation
of_all_time
.
For
Sam_Rayburn
never
forgot
Bonham
,
his
home
community
,
and
he
never
forgot
Texas
.
In
the
Same
way
I
like
to
think
we
owe
our
loyalty
as
legislators
to
our
community
,
our
district
,
our
State
.
And
,
if
we
follow
the
Rayburn
pattern
,
as
consciously
or
by
an
instinctual
political
sense
I
like
to
think
I
have
followed
it
,
then
the
very
nature
of
our
loyalty
to
our
own
immediate
areas
must
necessarily
be
reflected
in
the
devotion
of
our
services
to
our
country
.
For
what
Sam_Rayburn
's
life
in_this
House
teaches
us
is
that
loyalty
and
character
are
not
divisive
and
there
is
no
such
thing
as
being
for
your
country
and
neglecting
your
district
.
There
is
no
such
thing
as
being
diligent
about
national
affairs
but
indifferent
about
home
needs
.
The
two
are
as
one
.
This
may
not
be
the
greatest
but
it
certainly
comes_close
to
being
the
greatest
lesson
Sam_Rayburn
's
career
,
up_to
this
hour
,
teaches
all_of
us
who
would
aspire
to
distinction
in
political
life
under
our
processes
of
government
.
More_than
that
,
Sam_Rayburn
is
the
very
living
symbol
of
an
iron-clad
integrity
so
powerful
in
his
nature
and
so
constantly
demonstrated
that
he
can
count
some
of
his
best
friends
in
the
opposition
.
Through
the_most
rancorous
battles
of
political
controversy
and
the_most
bitterly
fought
national
and
presidential
campaigns
his
character
shines
as
an
example
of
dignity
and
honesty
,
forthrightness
and
nobility
.
Sam_Rayburn
has
never
had
to
look_back
at
any
of
his
most
devastating
fights
and
ever
feel
ashamed
of
his
conduct
as
a
combatant
under_fire
or
his
political
manners
in
the
heat
of
conflicting
ambitions
.
This
means
much
to
the
American
tradition
.
It
is
an
answer
in
its
way
,
individual
and
highly
dramatic
,
to
the
charge
that
the
democratic
process
is
necessarily
vicious
in
its
campaign
characteristics
.
And
the
name
Rayburn
is
one
of
the_most
dominant
in
the
history
of
American
politics
for
the
last
half
century
.
It
is
,
I
insist
,
hard
to
define
the
Rayburn
contribution
to
our
political
civilization
because
it
is
so
massive
and
so
widespread
and
so
complicated
,
and
because
it
goes
so
deep
.
But
this
we
know
:
Here
is
a
great
life
that
in
every
area
of
American
politics
gives
the
American
people
occasion
for
pride
and
that
has
invested
the
democratic
process
with
the_most
decent
qualities
of
honor
,
decency
,
and
self-respect
.
I
pray
to
God
that
he
may
be
spared
to
us
for
many
years
to
come
for
this
is
an
influence
the
United_States
and
the
whole
world
can
ill
afford
to
lose
.
All_but
two
of
my
nine
terms
in
the
House_of_Representatives
has
been
served
under
the
Speakership
of
Sam_Rayburn
.
Of_this
I
am
proud
.
I
have
a
distinct
admiration
for
this
man
we
honor
today
because
of
the
humility
with
which
he
carries
his
greatness
.
And
Sam_Rayburn
is
a
great
man
-
one
who
will
go_down
in
American
history
as
a
truly
great
leader
of
the
Nation
.
He
will
be
considered
not_only
great
among
his
contemporaries
,
but
as
great
among
all
the
Americans
who
have
played
a
part
in
the
country
's
history
since
the
beginning
.
I
pay
my
personal
tribute
to
Sam_Rayburn
,
stalwart
Texan
and
great
American
,
not_only
because
today
he
establishes
a
record
of
having
served
as
Speaker
of
the
House_of_Representatives
more_than
twice_as
long
as
Henry_Clay
,
but
because
of
the
contributions
he
has
made
to
the
welfare
of
the
people
of
the
Nation
during
his
almost
half
century
of
service
as
a
Member
of
Congress
.
Speaker_Rayburn
has
not
limited
his
leadership
as
a
statesman
to
his
direction
of
the
House
in
the
Speaker
's
chair
.
He
had
an
outstanding
record
as
a
legislator
since
the
start
of
his
career
in
the
House
in
1913
,
the
63
d
Congress
.
No
one
has
sponsored
more
progressive
and
important
legislation
than
has
Sam_Rayburn
.
He
is
the
recognized
``
father
''
of
the
Rural_Electrification_Administration
and
the
Security
and
Exchange_Commission
.
But
to
run_the_gauntlet
of
the
programs
Sam_Rayburn
brought
into
being
through
his
legislative
efforts
would
fill
the
pages
of
today
's
Record
.
No
greater
pleasure
has
come
to
me
in
my
own
service
in_this
House
than
to
be
present
today
to
participate
in_this
tribute
to
this
great
Speaker
,
this
great
legislator
,
this
great
Texan
,
this
great
American
.
My
sincere
wish
is
that
he
continues
to
add
to
this
record
he
sets
here
today
.
Sam_Rayburn
is
one
of
the
greatest
American
public
figures
in
the
history
of
our
country
and
I
consider
that
I
have
been
signally
honored
in
the
privilege
of
knowing
Sam_Rayburn
and
sharing
with
him
the
rights
and
obligations
of
a
Member
of
the
House_of_Representatives
in
the
Congress
of
the
United_States
.
Others
may
speak
of
Speaker_Rayburn
'
S
uniquely
long
and
devoted
service
;
of
his
championship
of
many_of
the
progressive
social
measures
which
adorn
our
statute_books
today
,
and
of
his
cooperation
in
times
of
adversity
with
Presidents
of
both
of
our
major
parties
in
helping
to
pilot
the
Ship
of
State
through
the
shoals
of
today
's
stormy
international
seas
.
I
prefer
to
speak
,
however
,
of
Sam_Rayburn
,
the
person
,
rather_than
Sam_Rayburn
,
the
American
institution
.
Although
Sam_Rayburn
affects
a
gruff
exterior
in
many
instances
,
nevertheless
he
is
fundamentally
a
man
of
warm
heart
and
gentle
disposition
.
No
one
could
be
more
devoted
than
he
to
the
American_Congress
as
an
institution
and
more
aware_of
its
historical
significance
in
the
political
history
of
the
world
,
and
I
shall
never
forget
his
moving
talks
,
delivered
in
simple
yet
eloquent
words
,
upon
the
meaning
of
our
jobs
as
Representatives
in
the
operation
of
representative
government
and
their
importance
in
the
context
of
today
's
assault
upon
popular
government
.
Above_all
,
he
is
a
person
to
whom
a
fledgling
Representative
can
go
to
discuss
the
personal
and
professional
problems
which
inevitably
confront
a
new
Congressman
.
In_this
role
of
father
confessor
,
he
has
always
been
most
characteristic
and
most
helpful
.
On
September
16
,
Sam_Rayburn
will
have
served
as
Speaker
twice_as
long
as
any
predecessor
and
I
am
proud
to
join
with
others
in
marking
this
date
,
and
in
expressing
my
esteem
for
that
notable
American
,
Sam_Rayburn
.
