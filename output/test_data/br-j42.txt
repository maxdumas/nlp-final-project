In
the
century
from
1815
to
1914
the
law_of_nations
became
international_law
.
Several
factors
contributed
to
this
change
.
The
Congress_of_Vienna
is
a
convenient
starting_point
because
it
both
epitomized
and
symbolized
what
was
to
follow
.
Here
in
1815
the
great
nations
assembled
to
legislate
not
merely
for
Europe
,
but
for
the
world
.
Thus
the
Congress
marks
a
formal
recognition
of
the
political_system
that
was
central
to
world
politics
for
a
century
.
International_law
had
to
fit
the
conditions
of
Europe
,
and
nothing
that
could
not
fit
this
system
,
or
the
interests
of
the
great
European_nations
collectively
,
could
possibly
emerge
as
law
in
any
meaningful
sense
.
Essentially
this
imposed
two
conditions
:
First
,
international_law
had
to
recognize
and
be
compatible
with
an
international
political_system
in
which
a
number
of
states
were
competitive
,
suspicious
,
and
opportunistic
in
their
political
alignments
with
one
another
;
second
,
it
had
to
be
compatible
with
the
value_system
that
they
shared
.
In
both
respects
,
international_law
was
Europeanized
.
It
was
not
always
easy
to
develop
theory
and
doctrine
which
would
square
the
two
conditions
.
On_the_one_hand
,
the
major
European_nations
had
to
maintain
vis-a-vis
each
other
an
emphasis
upon
sovereignty
,
independence
,
formal
equality
-
thus
insuring
for
themselves
individually
an
optimal
freedom
of
action
to
maintain
the
``
flexibility
of
alignment
''
that
the
system
required
and
to
avoid
anything
approaching
a
repetition
of
the
disastrous
Napoleonic
experience
.
But
there
was
no
pressing
need
to
maintain
these
same
standards
with
regard_to
most_of
the
rest
of
the
world
.
Thus
,
theory
and
doctrine
applicable
among
the
great
nations
and
the
smaller
European
states
did
not
really
comfortably
fit
less
developed
and
less
powerful
societies
elsewhere
.
Political
interference
in
Africa
and
Asia
and
even
in
Latin_America
(
though
limited
in
Latin_America
by
the
special
interest
of
the
United_States
as
expressed
in
the
Monroe_Doctrine
,
itself
from
the
outset
related_to
European
politics
and
long
dependent
upon
the
``
balance_of_power
''
system
in
Europe
)
was
necessary
in_order
to
preserve
both
common
economic_values
and
the
European
``
balance
''
itself
.
A
nation
such_as
Switzerland
could
be
neutralized
by
agreement
and
could
be
relied_upon
to
protect
its
neutrality
;
more
doubtful
,
but
possible
,
(
with
an
assist
from
the
North
)
was
the
neutralization
of
the
Latin_American
countries
;
out_of_the_question
was
the
neutralization
of
Asia
and
Africa
.
This
Europeanization
of
the
law
was
made
explicit
by
a
number
of
19_th
century
scholars
.
More
emphasis
was
put
upon
the
fact
that
international_law
was
the
law
of
``
civilized
nations
''
;
Kent
and
Story
,
the
great
early
American
scholars
,
repeatedly
made_use_of
this
phrase
,
or
of
``
Christian
nations
''
,
which
is
a
substantial
equivalent
.
Wheaton
stated
that
the
public_law
was
essentially
``
limited
to
the
civilized
and
Christian
peoples
of
Europe
or
to
those
of
European
origin
''
.
Of_course
it
had
always
been
of
European
origin
in_fact
,
but
it
had
maintained
a
universal
outlook
under
the
natural_law
theory
.
Now
,
with
virtually
every
writer
,
not_only
was
the
European
origin
of
public_law
acknowledged
as
a
historical
phenomenon
,
but
the
rules
thus
established
by
the
advanced
civilizations
of
Europe
were
to
be
imposed
on
others
.
The
European
customs
on
which
international_law
was
based
were
to
become
,
by
force
and
fiat
,
the
customs
that
others
were
to
accept
as
law
if
they
were
to
join
this
community
as
sovereign
states
.
Hall
,
for_example
,
was
quite
explicit
on
this
point
when
he
said
``
states
outside
European
civilization
must
formally
enter
into
the
circle
of
law
governed
countries
.
They
must
do
something
with
the
acquiescence
of
the
latter
,
or
some
of
them
,
which
amounts
to
an
acceptance
of
the
law
in
its
entirety
beyond
all
possibility
of
misconstruction
''
.
During
the
nineteenth
century
these
views
were
protested
by
virtually
all
the
Latin_American
writers
,
though
ineffectively
,
just
as
the
new
nations
of
Africa
and
Asia
protest
them
,
with
more
effect
,
today
.
A
number
of
other
nineteenth
century
developments
contributed
to
the
transmutation
of
the
law_of_nations
into
international_law
;
that_is
,
from
aspects
of
a
universal
system
of
Justice
into
particular
rules
governing
the
relations
of
sovereign
states
.
The
difference
is
important
,
for
although
the
older
law_of_nations
did
cover
relationships
among
sovereigns
,
this
was
by_no_means
its
exclusive
domain
.
The
law
of
nature
governed
sovereigns
in
their
relationship
to
their
own
citizens
,
to
foreigners
,
and
to
each
other
in
a
conceptually
unified
system
.
The
theory
of
international_law
,
which
in
the
nineteenth
century
became
common
to
virtually
all
writers
in
Europe
and
America
,
broke
this
unity
and
this
universality
.
It
lost
sight
of
the
individual
almost
entirely
and
confined
itself
to
rules
limiting
the
exercise
of
state
power
for
reasons
essentially
unconnected
with
justice
or
morality
save
as
these
values
might
affect
international
relations
.
No_longer
did
the
sovereign
look_to
the
law_of_nations
to
determine
what
he
ought
to
do
;
his
search
was
merely
for
rules
that
might
limit
his
freedom
of
action
.
To
appreciate
this
development
,
we
must
relate
it
to
other
aspects
of
nineteenth
century
philosophy
.
First
,
and
most
obvious
,
was
the
growing
nationalism
and
the
tendency
to
regard
the
state
,
and
the
individual
's
identification
with
the
state
,
as
transcending
other
ties
of
social
solidarity
.
National
identification
was
not
new
,
but
it
was
accelerating
in
intensity
and
scope
throughout
Europe
as
new
unifications
occurred
.
It
reached
its
ultimate
philosophical
statement
in
notions
of
``
state
will
''
put_forward
by
the
Germans
,
especially
by
Hegel
,
although
political
philosophers
will
recognize
its
origins
in
the
rejected
doctrines
of
Hobbes
.
National
identification
was
reflected
jurisprudentially
in
law
theories
which
incorporated
this
Hegelian
abstraction
and
saw
law
,
domestic
and
international
,
simply
as
its
formal
reflection
.
In
the
international
community
this
reduced
law
to
Jellinek
's
auto_limitation
.
A
state
,
the
highest
form
of
human
organization
in
fact
and
theory
,
could
be
subjected
to
Law
only
by
a
manifestation
of
self-will
,
or
consent
.
According_to
the
new
theories
,
the
nineteenth
century
corporate
sovereign
was
``
sovereign
''
in
a
quite
new
and
different
sense
from
his
historical
predecessors
.
He
no_longer
sought
to
find
the
law
;
he
made
it
;
he
could
be
subjected
to
law
only
because
he
agreed
to
be
.
There
was
no
law
,
domestic
or
international
,
except
that
willed
by
,
acknowledged
by
,
or
consented
to
by
states
.
Hidden
behind
Hegelian
abstractions
were
more
practical
reasons
for
a
changing
jurisprudence
.
Related_to
,
but
distinguishable
from
,
nationalism
was
the
growth
of
democracy
in
one
form
or
another
.
Increased
participation
in
politics
and
the
demands
of
various
groups
for
status
and
recognition
had
dramatic
effects
upon
law
institutions
.
The
efforts
of
various
interest
groups
to
control
or
influence
governmental
decisions
,
particularly
when
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
impact
of
industrialization
,
led
to
a
concentration
of
attention
on
the
legislative
power
and
the
means
whereby
policy
could
be
formulated
and
enforced
as
law
through
bureaucratic
institutions
.
Law
became
a
conscious
process
,
something
more
than
simply
doing
justice
and
looking_to
local
customs
and
a
common
morality
for
applicable
norms
.
Particularly
was
this
true
when
the
norms
previously
applied
were
no_longer
satisfactory
to
many
,
when
customs
were
rapidly
changing
as
the
forces
of
the
new
productivity
were
harnessed
.
The
old
way
of
doing
things
,
which
depended_on
a
relatively
stable
community
with
stable
ideas
dealing
with
familiar
situations
,
was
no_longer
adequate_to
the
task
.
First
was
the
period
of
codification
of
existing
law
:
the
Code_Napoleon
in
France
and
the
peculiar
codification
that
,
in_fact
,
resulted
from
Austin
's
restatement
and
ordering
of
the
Common_Law
in
England
.
Codification
was
followed
in
all
countries
by
a
growing
amount
of
legislation
,
some
changing
and
adjusting
the
older
law
,
much
dealing
with
entirely
new
situations
.
The
legislative
mills
have
been
grinding
ever
since
,
and
when
its
cumbersome
processes
were
no_longer
adequate_to
the
task
,
a
limited
legislative
authority
was
delegated
in
one
form
or
another
,
to
the
executive
.
Whereas
the
eighteenth
century
had
been
a
time
in
which
man
sought
justice
,
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
have
been
centuries
in
which
men
are
satisfied
with
law
.
Indeed
,
with
developed
positivism
,
the
separation
of
law
from
justice
,
or
from
morality
generally
,
became
quite
specific
.
In
municipal
systems
we
tend
to
view
what
is
called
positivism
as
fundamentally
a
movement
to
democratize
policy
by
increasing
the
power
of
parliament
-
the
elected
representatives
-
at
the
expense
of
the
more
conservative
judiciary
.
When
the
power
of
the
latter
was
made
both
limited
and
explicit
-
when
norms
were
clarified
and
made
more
precise
and
the
creation
of
new
norms
was
placed
exclusively
in
parliamentary
hands
-
two
purposes
were
served
:
Government
was
made
subservient
to
an
institutionalized
popular
will
,
and
law
became
a
rational
system
for
implementing
that
will
,
for
serving
conscious
goals
,
for
embodying
the
``
public
policy
''
.
It
is
true
that
,
initially
,
the
task
was
to
remove
restrictions
that
,
it
was
thought
,
inhibited
the
free
flow
of
money
,
goods
,
and
labor
;
but
even
laissez-faire
was
a
conscious
policy
.
Law
was
seen
as
an
emanation
of
the
``
sovereign
will
''
.
However
,
the
sovereign
was
not
Hobbes
'
absolute
monarch
but
rather
the
parliamentary
sovereign
of
Austin
.
It
was
,
too
,
an
optimistic
philosophy
,
and
,
though
it
separated
law
from
morality
,
it
was
by_no_means
an
immoral
or
amoral
one
.
Man
,
through
democratic
institutions
of
government
and
economic
freedom
,
was
master
of
his
destiny
.
The
theory
did
not
require
,
though
it
unfortunately
might
acquire
,
a
Hegelian
mystique
.
It
was
merely
a
rationalization
and
ordering
of
new
institutions
of
popular
government
.
It
was
not
opposed
to
either
justice
or
morality
;
it
merely
wished
to
minimize
subjective
views
of
officials
who
wielded
public
authority
.
Particularly
was
this
true
as
laissez-faire
capitalism
became
the
dominant
credo
of
Western
society
.
To
free
the
factors
of
production
was
a
major
objective
of
the
rising
bourgeoisie
,
and
this
objective
required
that
governmental
authority
-
administrative_officials
and
judges
-
be
limited
as
precisely
and
explicitly
as
possible
;
that
old
customs
which
inhibited
trade
be
abrogated
;
that
business
be
free
from
governmental
supervision
and
notions
of
morality
which
might
clog
the
automatic
adjustments
of
the
free
market
;
that
obligations
of
status
that
were
inconsistent
with
the
new
politics
and
the
new
economics
be
done
away
with
.
Contract
-
conceived
as
the
free
bargain
of
formal
equals
-
replaced
the
implied
obligations
of
a
more
static
and
status
conscious
society
.
Indeed
,
contract
was
the
dominant
legal
theme
of
the
century
,
the
touchstone
of
the
free
society
.
Government
itself
was
based
upon
contract
;
business_organization
-
the
corporation
-
was
analyzed
in
contractual
terms
;
trade
was
based
on
freedom
of
contract
,
and
money
was
lent
and
borrowed
on
contractual
terms
;
even
marriage
and
the
family
was
seen
as
a
contractual
arrangement
.
It
is
not
surprising
that
the
international
obligations
of
states
were
also
viewed
in_terms_of
contract
.
In_fact
,
some
-
Anzilotti
is
the
principle
example
-
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
all
international_law
could
be
traced
to
the
single
legal
norm
,
Pacta
sunt
Servanda
.
The
displacement
(
at_least
to
a
considerable
extent
)
of
the
ethical
jurisprudence
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
by
positivism
reshaped
both
international_law
theory
and
doctrine
.
In_the_first_place
the
new
doctrine
brought
a
formal
separation
of
international
from
municipal
law
,
rejecting
the
earlier
view
that
both
were
parts
of
a
universal
legal_system
.
One
result
was
to
nationalize
much
that
had
been
regarded_as
the
law_of_nations
.
Admiralty_law
,
the
law_merchant
,
and
the
host
of
problems
which
arise
in
private
litigation
because
of
some
contact
with
a
foreign
country
were
all
severed
from
the
older
Law_of_Nations
and
made
dependent_on
the
several
national
laws
.
Private
international_law
(
which
Americans
call
the
``
conflict
of
laws
''
)
was
thus
segregated
from
international_law
proper
,
or
,
as
it
is
often
called
,
public
international_law
.
States
were
free
to
enact
,
within
broad
though
(
perhaps
)
determinate
limits
,
their
own
rules
as_to
the
application
of
foreign
law
by
their
courts
,
to
vary
the
law_merchant
,
and
to
enact
legislation
with
regard_to
many
claims
arising
on
the
high_seas
.
The
change
was
not
quite
so
dramatic
as
it
sounds
because
in_fact
common
norms
continued
to
be
invoked
by
municipal
courts
and
were
only
gradually
changed
by
legislation
,
and
then
largely
in
marginal
situations
.
