A
band
viscometer
is
shown
in
Figure
2
.
It
consists_of
two
blocks
with
flat
surfaces
held
apart
by
shims
.
There
is
a
small
well
in
the
top
in
which
the
fluid
or
paste
to
be
tested
is
placed
.
A
tape
of
cellulose_acetate
is
pulled
between
the
blocks
and
the
tape
pulls
the
fluid
or
paste
with
it
between
the
parallel
faces
of
the
blocks
.
In
normal
use
weights
are
hung_on
the
end
of
the
tape
and
allowed
to
pull
the
tape
and
the
material
to
be
tested
between
the
blocks
.
After
it
has
reached
terminal_velocity
,
the
time
for
the
tape
to
travel
a
known
distance
is
recorded
.
By
the
use
of
various
weights
,
data
for
a
force
rate
of
shear
graph
can
be
obtained
.
The
instrument
used
for
this
work
was
a
slight
modification
of
that
previously
described
.
In
this
test
a
*
*
f
tape
was
pulled
between
the
blocks
with
a
motor
and
pulley
at
a
rate
of
*
*
f
with
a
clearance
of
0.002
''
on
each
side
of
the
tape
.
This
gives
a
rate
of
shear
of
*
*
f
.
This
,
however
,
can
only
be
considered
approximate
,
as
the
diameter
of
the
pulley
was
increased
by
the
build-up
of
tape
and
the
tape
was
occasionally
removed
from
the
pulley
during
the
runs
.
The
face
of
one
block
contained
a
hole
1
16
''
in
diameter
which
led
to
a
manometer
for
the
measurement
of
the
normal
pressure
.
Although
there
were
only
four
fluids
tested
,
it
was
apparent
that
there
were
two
distinct
types
.
Two
of
the
fluids
showed
a
high
positive
normal
pressure
when
undergoing
shear
,
and
two
showed
small
negative
pressures
which
were
negligible
in_comparison_with
the
amount
of
the
positive
pressures
generated
by
the
other
two
.
Figure
3
shows
the
data
on
a
silicone
fluid
,
labeled
12500
cps
which
gave
a
high
positive
normal
pressure
.
Although
the
tape
was
run
for
over
1
hr.
,
a
steady
state
was
not
reached
,
and
it
was
concluded
that
the
reason
for
this
was
that
the
back
pressure
of
the
manometer
was
built_up
from
the
material
fed
from
between
the
blocks
and
this
was
available
at
a
very
slow
rate
.
A
system
had_to
be
used
which
did
not
depend_upon
the
feeding
of
the
fluid
into
the
manometer
if
measurements
of
the
normal
pressure
were
to
be
made
in
a
reasonable
time
.
A
back
pressure
was
then
introduced
,
and
the
rise
or
fall
of
the
material
in
the
manometer
indicated
which
was
greater
,
the
normal
pressure
in
the
block
or
the
back
pressure
.
By
this
method
it
was
determined
that
the
normal
pressure
exerted
by
a
sample
of
polybutene
(
molecular_weight
reported
to
be
770
)
was
over
half
an
atmosphere
.
The
actual
pressure
was
not
determined
because
the
pressure
was
beyond
the
upper_limit
of
the
apparatus
on_hand
.
The
two
fluids
which
gave
the
small
negative
pressures
were
polybutenes
with
molecular_weights
which
were
stated
to
be
520
and
300
.
These
are
fluids
which
one
would
expect
to
be
less
viscoelastic
or
more
Newtonian
because
of
their
lower
molecular_weight
.
The
maximum
suction
was
3.25
''
of
test
fluid
measured
from
the
top
of
the
block
,
and
steady
states
were
apparently
reached
with
these
fluids
.
It
is
presumed
that
this
negative
head
was
associated
with
some
geometric
factor
of
the
assembly
,
since
different
readings
were
obtained
with
the
same
fluid
and
the
only
apparent
difference
was
the
assembly
and
disassembly
of
the
apparatus
.
This
negative
pressure
is
not
explained
by
the
velocity
head
*
*
f
since
this
is
not
sufficient
to
explain
the
readings
by
several
magnitudes
.
These
experiments
can
be
considered
exploratory
only
.
However
,
they
do
demonstrate
the
presence
of
large
normal
pressures
in
the
presence
of
flat
shear
fields
which
were
forecast
by
the
theory
in
the
first
part
of
the
paper
.
They
also
give
information
which
will
aid
in
the
design
of
a
more
satisfactory
instrument
for
the
measurement
of
the
normal
pressures
.
Such
an
instrument
would
be
useful
for
the
characterization
of
many
commercial
materials
as_well_as
theoretical
studies
.
The
elasticity
as
a
parameter
of
fluids
which
is
not
subject_to
simple
measurement
at_present
,
and
it
is
a
parameter
which
is
probably
varying
in
an
unknown
manner
with
many
commercial
materials
.
Such
an
instrument
is
expected
to
be
especially
useful
if
it
could
be
used
to
measure
the
elasticity
of
heavy
pastes
such_as
printing_inks
,
paints
,
adhesives
,
molten
plastics
,
and
bread_dough
,
for
the
elasticity
is
related
to
those
various
properties
termed
``
length
''
,
``
shortness
''
,
``
spinnability
''
,
etc.
,
which
are
usually
judged
by
subjective
methods
at_present
.
The
actual
change
*
*
f
caused
by
a
shear
field
is
calculated
by
multiplying
the
pressure
differential
times
the
volume
,
just_as_it_is
for
any
gravitational
or
osmotic_pressure
head
.
If
the
volume
is
the
molal
volume
,
then
*
*
f
is
obtained
on
a
molal
basis
which
is
the
customary
terminology
of
the
chemists
.
Although
the
*
*
f
calculation
is
obvious
by_analogy_with
that
for
gravitational_field
and
osmotic_pressure
,
it
is
interesting
to
confirm
it
by
a
method
which
can
be
generalized
to
include
related
effects
.
Consider
a
shear
field
with
a
height
of
H
and
a
cross-sectional
area
of
A
opposed
by
a
manometer
with
a
height
of
h
(
referred
to
the
same
base
as
H
)
and
a
cross-sectional
area
of
a
.
If
*
*
f
is
the
change
per
unit
volume
in
Gibbs
function
caused
by
the
shear
field
at
constant
P
and
T
,
and
|r
is
the
density
of
the
fluid
,
then
the
total
potential_energy
of
the
system
above
the
reference
height
is
*
*
f
.
*
*
f
is
the
work
necessary
to
fill
the
manometer
column
from
the
reference
height
to
h
.
The
total
volume
of
the
system
above
the
reference
height
is
*
*
f
,
and
h
can
be
eliminated
to
obtain
an
equation
for
the
total
potential_energy
of
the
system
in_terms_of
H
.
The
minimum
total
potential_energy
is
found
by
taking
the
derivative
with_respect_to
H
and
equating
to
zero
.
This
gives
*
*
f
,
which
is
the
pressure
.
This
is
interesting
for
it
combines
both
the
thermodynamic
concept
of
a
minimum
Gibbs
function
for
equilibrium
and
minimum
mechanical
potential_energy
for
equilibrium
.
This
method
can
be
extended
to
include
the
concentration
differences
caused
by
shear
fields
.
The
relation
between
osmotic_pressure
and
the
Gibbs
function
may
also
be
developed
in
an
analogous
way
.
In
the
above
development
we
have
applied
the
thermodynamics_of_equilibrium
(
referred
to
by
some
as
thermostatics
)
to
the
steady
state
.
This
can
be
justified
thermodynamically
in
this
case
,
and
this
will
be
done
in
a
separate
paper
which
is
being
prepared
.
This
has
an
interesting
analogy
with
the
assumption
stated
by
Philippoff
that
``
the
deformational
mechanics
of
elastic
solids
can
be
applied
to
flowing
solutions
''
.
There
is
one
exception
to
the
above
statement
as
has
been
pointed_out
,
and
that
is
that
fluids
can
relax
by
flowing
into
fields
of
lower
rates
of
shear
,
so
the
statement
should
be
modified
by
stating
that
the
mechanics
are
similar
.
If
the
mechanics
are
similar
,
we
can
also
infer
that
the
thermodynamics
will
also
be
similar
.
The
concept
of
the
strain
energy
as
a
Gibbs
function
difference
*
*
f
and
exerting
a
force
normal
to
the
shearing
face
is
compatible
with
the
information
obtained
from
optical
birefringence
studies
of
fluids
undergoing
shear
.
Essentially
these
birefringence
studies
show
that
at
low
rates
of
shear
a
tension
is
present
at
45
`
to
the
direction
of
shear
,
and
as
the
rate
of
shear
increases
,
the
direction
of
the
maximum
tension
moves
asymptotically
toward
the
direction
of
shear
.
According_to
Philippoff
,
the
recoverable
shear
s
is
given
by
*
*
f
where
|c
is
the
angle_of_extinction
.
From
this
and
the
force
of
deformation
it
should
be
possible
to
calculate
the
elastic
energy
of
deformation
which
should
be
equal
to
the
*
*
f
calculated
from
the
pressure
normal
to
the
shearing
face
.
There
is
another
means
which
should
show
the
direction
and
relative
value
of
the
stresses
in
viscoelastic
fluids
that
is
not
mentioned
as_such
in
the
literature
,
and
that
is
the
shape
of
the
suspended
drops
of
low
viscosity
fluids
in
shear
fields
.
These
droplets
are
distorted
by
the
normal
forces
just
as
a
balloon
would
be
pulled
or
pressed
out
of
shape
in
one
's
hands
.
These
droplets
appear
to
be
ellipsoids
,
and
it
is
mathematically
convenient
to
assume
that
they
are
.
If
they
are
not
ellipsoids
,
the
conclusions
will
be
a
reasonable
approximation
.
The
direction
of
the
tension
of
minimum
pressure
is
,
of_course
,
given
by
the
direction
of
the
major_axis
of
the
ellipsoids
.
Mason
and
Taylor
both
show
that
the
major_axis
of
the
ellipsoids
is
at
45
`
at
low
rates
of
shear
and
that
it
approaches
the
direction
of
shear
with
increased
rates
of
shear
.
(
Some
suspensions
break_up
before
they
are
near
to
the
direction
of
shear
,
and
some
become
asymptotic
to
it
without
breakup
.
)
This
is
,
of_course
,
a
similar
type
of
behavior
to
that
indicated
by
birefringence
studies
.
The
relative
forces
can
be
calculated
from
the
various
radii_of_curvature
if
we
assume
:
(
A
)
The
surface_tension
is
uniform
on
the
surface
of
the
drop
.
(
B
)
That
because
of
the
low
viscosity
of
the
fluid
,
the
internal
pressure
is
the
same
in
all
directions
.
(
C
)
The
kinetic
effects
are
negligible
.
(
D
)
Since
the
shape
of
the
drop
conforms_to
the
force
field
,
it
does
not
appreciably
affect
the
distribution
of
forces
in
the
fluid
.
These
are
reasonable
assumptions
with
low
viscosity
fluids
suspended
in
high
viscosity
fluids
which
are
subjected
to
low
rates
of
shear
.
Just
as
the
pressure
exerted
by
surface_tension
in
a
spherical
drop
is
*
*
f
and
the
pressure
exerted
by
surface_tension
on
a
cylindrical
shape
is
*
*
f
,
the
pressure
exerted
by
any
curved
surface
is
*
*
f
,
where
|g
is
the
interfacial_tension
and
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
are
the
two
radii_of_curvature
.
This
formula
is
given
by
Rumscheidt
and
Mason
.
If
a
is
the
major_axis
of
an
ellipsoid
and
b
and
c
are
the
other
two
axes
,
the
radius_of_curvature
in
the
ab
plane
at
the
end
of
the
axis
is
*
*
f
,
and
the
difference
in
pressure
along
the
a
and
b
axes
is
*
*
f
.
There
are
no
data
published
in
the
literature
on
the
shape
of
low
viscosity
drops
to
confirm
the
above
formulas
.
However
,
there
are
photographs
of
suspended
drops
of
cyclohexanol_phthalate
(
viscosity
155
poises
)
suspended
in
corn_syrup
of
71
poises
in
a
paper
by
Mason
and
Bartok
.
This
viscosity
of
the
material
in
the
drops
is
,
of_course
,
not
negligible
.
Measurements
on
the
photograph
in
this
paper
give
*
*
f
at
the
maximum
rate
of
shear
of
*
*
f
.
If
it
is
assumed
that
the
formula
given
by
Lodge
of
*
*
f
,
cosec
2lc
applies
,
the
pressure
difference
along
the
major_axes
can
be
calculated
from
the
angle
of
inclination
of
the
major_axis
,
and
from
this
the
interfacial_tension
can
be
calculated
.
Its
value
was
*
*
f
from
the
above
data
.
This
appears
to
be
high
,
as
would
be
expected
from
the
appreciable
viscosity
of
the
material
in
the
drops
.
It
is
appropriate
to
call_attention_to
certain
thermodynamic
properties
of
an
ideal_gas
that
are
analogous
to
rubber-like
deformation
.
The
internal
energy
of
an
ideal_gas
depends_on
temperature
only
and
is
independent
of
pressure
or
volume
.
In_other_words
,
if
an
ideal_gas
is
compressed
and
kept
at
constant
temperature
,
the
work
done
in
compressing
it
is
completely
converted
into
heat
and
transferred
to
the
surrounding
heat_sink
.
This
means
that
work
equals
q
which
in_turn
equals
*
*
f
.
There
is
a
well-known
relationship
between
probability
and
entropy
which
states
that
*
*
f
,
where
\q
is
the
probability
that
state
(
i.e.
,
volume
for
an
ideal_gas
)
could
be
reached
by
chance
alone
.
this
is
known
as
conformational_entropy
.
This
conformational_entropy
is
,
in
this
case
,
equal
to
the
usual
entropy
,
for
there
are
no
other
changes
or
other
energies
involved
.
Note
that
though
the
ideal_gas
itself
contains
no
additional
energy
,
the
compressed
gas
does
exert
an
increased
pressure
.
The
energy
for
any
isothermal
work
done
by
the
perfect_gas
must
come
as
thermal
energy
from
its
surroundings
.
