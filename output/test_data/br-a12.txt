A
Texas
halfback
who
does
n't
even
know
the
team
's
plays
,
Eldon_Moritz
,
ranks
fourth
in
Southwest_Conference
scoring
after
three
games
.
Time
stands_still
every
time
Moritz
,
a
26
-
year
old
Army_Signal_Corps
veteran
,
goes_into
the
field
.
Although
he
never
gets
to
play
while
the
clock
is
running
,
he
gets
a
big
kick
-
several
every
Saturday
,
in_fact
-
out
of
football
.
Moritz
does
n't
even
have
a
nose
guard
or
hip_pads
but
he
's
one
of
the
most
valuable
members
of
the
Longhorn
team
that
will
be
heavily
favored
Saturday
over
Oklahoma
in
the
cotton_bowl
.
That
's
because
he
already
has
kicked
14
extra_points
in
15
tries
.
He
ran
his
string
of
successful
conversions
this
season
to
13
straight
before
one
went
astray
last
Saturday
night
in
the
41
-
8
slaughter
of
Washington_State
.
Moritz
is
listed
on
the
Longhorn
roster
as
a
right
halfback
,
the
position
at
which
he
lettered
on
the
1956
team
.
But
ask
coach
Darrell_Royal
what
position
he
plays
and
you
'll
get
the
quick
response
,
``
place_kicker
''
.
A
208
-
pound
,
6
-
foot
1
-
inch
senior
from
Stamford
,
Moritz
practices
nothing
but
place-kicking
.
Last
year
,
when
he
worked_out
at
halfback
all
season
,
he
did
n't
get_into
a
single
game
.
``
This
year
,
coach
Royal
told
me
if
I
'd
work_on
my
place-kicking
he
thought
he
could
use
me
''
,
said
Moritz
.
``
So
I
started
practicing
on
it
in
spring_training
.
Moritz
was
bothered
during
the
first
two
games
this
year
by
a
pulled
muscle
in
the
thigh
of
his
right
(
kicking
)
leg
and
,
as
a
result
,
several
of
his
successful
conversions
have
gone
barely
far
enough
.
Moritz
said
Monday
his
leg
feels
fine
and
,
as
a
result
,
he
hopes
to
start
practicing
field_goals
this
week
.
He
kicked
several
while
playing
at
Stamford_High_School
,
including
one
that
beat
Anson
,
3
-
0
,
in
a
1953
district
game
.
``
I
kicked
about
110
extra_points
in
135
tries
during
three
years
in
high_school
''
,
he
said
,
``
and
made
26
in_a_row
at
one
time
.
I
never
did
miss
one
in
a
playoff_game
-
I
kicked
about
20
in
the
five
playoff_games
my
last
two
years
''
.
Moritz
came
to
Texas
in
1954
but
his
freshman
football
efforts
were
hampered
by
a
knee
injury
.
He
missed
the
1955
season
because
of
an
operation
on
the
ailing
knee
,
then
played
77
minutes
in
1956
.
His
statistical
record
that
year
,
when
Texas
won
only
one
game
and
lost
nine
,
was
far
from
impressive
:
he
carried
the
ball
three
times
for
a
net
gain
of
10
yards
,
punted
once
for
39
yards
and
caught
one
pass
for
13
yards
.
He
went_into
the
Army
in
March
,
1957
,
and
returned
two
years
later
.
But
he
was
scholastically
ineligible
in
1959
and
merely
present
last
season
.
Place_kicking
is
largely
a
matter
of
timing
,
Moritz
declared
.
``
Once
you
get
the
feel
of
it
,
there
's
not
much
to
it
.
I
've
tried
to
teach
some
of
the
other
boys
to
kick
and
some
of
them
can't
seem
to
get
the
feel
.
Practice
helps
you
to
get
your
timing
down
.
``
It
's
kind_of
like
golf
-
if
you
do
n't
swing
a
club
very
often
,
your
timing
gets
off
''
.
Moritz
,
however
,
kicks
only
about
10
or
12
extra_points
during
each
practice_session
.
``
If
you
kick
too_much
,
your
leg
gets
kinda
dead
''
,
he
explained
.
In
their
first
three
games
,
the
Longhorns
have
had
the
ball
41
times
and
scored
16
times
,
or
40
per_cent
their
total
passing
yardage
in
three
games
,
447
on
30
completions
in
56
attempts
,
is
only
22
yards
short
of
their
total
passing
yardage
in
1959
,
when
they
made
469
on
37
completions
in
86
tries
.
Tailback
James_Saxton
already
has
surpassed
his
rushing
total
for
his
brilliant
sophomore
season
,
when
he
netted
271
yards
on
55
carries
;
he
now
has
273
yards
in
22
tries
during
three
games
.
Saxton
has
made
only
one
second-half
appearance
this
season
and
that
was
in
the
Washington_State
game
,
for
four
plays
:
he
returned
the
kickoff
30
yards
,
gained
five
yards
through
the
line
and_then
uncorked
a
56
-
yard
touchdown
run
before
retiring
to
the
bench
.
Wingback
Jack_Collins
injured
a
knee
in
the
Washington_State
game
but
insists
he
'll
be
ready
for
Oklahoma
.
Last
week
,
when
Royal
was
informed
that
three
Longhorns
were
among
the
conference
's
top
four
in
rushing
,
he
said
:
``
That
won't
last
long
''
.
It
did
n't
;
Monday
,
he
had
four
Longhorns
in
the
top
four
.
A
good
feeling
prevailed
on
the
SMU
coaching
staff
Monday
,
but
attention
quickly
turned
from
Saturday
's
victory
to
next
week
's
problem
:
Rice_University
.
The
Mustangs
do
n't
play
this
week
.
``
We
're
just
real
happy
for
the
players
''
,
Coach
Bill_Meek
said
of
the
9
-
7
victory
over
the
Air_Force_Academy
.
``
I
think
the
big
thing
about
the
game
was
that
our
kids
for
the
third
straight
week
stayed
in
there
pitching
and
kept
the
pressure
on
.
It
was
the
first
time
we
've
been
ahead
this
season
(
when
John_Richey
kicked
what
proved
to
be
the
winning
field_goal
)
''
.
Assistant
coach
John_Cudmore
described
victory
as
``
a
good
feeling
,
I
think
,
on
the
part
of
the
coaches
and
the
players
.
We
needed
it
and
we
got
it
''
.
Meek
expressed
particular
gratification
at
the
defensive
performances
of
end
Happy_Nelson
and
halfback
Billy_Gannon
.
Both
turned_in
top
jobs
for
the
second
straight
game
.
``
Nelson
played
magnificent
football
''
,
Meek
praised
.
``
He
knocked_down
the
interference
and
made
key
stops
lots_of
times
.
And
he
caused
the
fumble
that
set_up
our
touchdown
.
He
broke
that
boy
(
Air_Force
fullback
Nick_Arshinkoff
)
in
two
and
knocked
him
loose
from
the
football
''
.
Gannon
contributed
saving
plays
on
the
Falcons
'
aerial
thrusts
in
the
late
stages
.
One
was
on
a
fourth
down
screen_pass
from
the
Mustang
21
after
an
incomplete
pass
into
Gannon
's
territory
.
``
As_soon_as
it
started
to
form
,
Gannon
spotted
it
''
,
Meek
said
.
``
He
timed
it
just_right
and
broke_through
there
before
the
boy
(
halfback
Terry_Isaacson
)
had
time
to
turn_around
.
He
really
crucified
him
.
He
nailed
it
for
a
yard
loss
''
.
The
Air_Force's
,
and
the
game
's
,
final
play
,
was
a
long
pass
by
quarterback
Bob_McNaughton
which
Gannon
intercepted
on
his
own
44
and
returned
22
yards
.
``
He
just
lay
back
there
and
waited
for
it
''
,
Meek
said
.
``
He
almost
brought
it
back
all_the_way
''
.
Except
for
sophomore
center
Mike_Kelsey
and
fullback
Mike_Rice
,
Meek
expects
the
squad
to
be
physically
sound
for
Rice
.
``
Kelsey
is
very
doubtful
for
the
Rice
game
''
,
Meek
said
.
``
He
'll
be
out_of_action
all
this
week
.
He
got
hit
from
the
blind
side
by
the
split_end
coming_back
on
the
second
play
of
the
game
.
There
is
definitely
some
ligament
damage
in
his
knee
''
.
Rice
has
not
played
since
injuring
a
knee
in
the
opener
with
Maryland
.
``
He
's
looking
a_lot
better
,
and
he
's
able
to
run
''
,
Meek
explained
.
``
We
'll
let
him
do
a_lot
of
running
this
week
,
but
I
do
n't
know
if
he
'll
be
able
to
play
''
.
The
game
players
saw
the
Air_Force
film
Monday
,
ran
for
30_minutes
,
then
went
in
,
while
the
reserves
scrimmaged
for
45
minutes
.
``
We
'll
work
hard
Tuesday
,
Wednesday
and
Thursday
''
,
Meek
said
,
``
and
probably
will
have
a
good
scrimmage
Friday
.
We
'll
work_out
about
an
hour
on
Saturday
,
then
we
'll
work
Monday
and
Tuesday
of
next
week
,
then
taper_off
''
.
SMU
will
play
the
Owls
at
Rice_Stadium
in
Houston

The
Texas_Aggies
got
a
day_off
Monday
-
a
special
gift
from
Coach
Jim_Myers
for
its
conference
victory
last
Saturday
night
,
but
Myers
announced
that
halfback
George_Hargett
,
shaken_up
in
the
Tech
game
,
would
not
play
against
Trinity
Saturday
.
Halfback
Bud_Priddy
,
slowed
for
almost
a
month
by
a
slowly
mending
sprained
ankle
,
joined
TCU
's
workout
Monday
.
The
Dallas
Texans
were
back
home
Monday
with
their
third
victory
in
four
American_Football_League
starts
-
a
19
-
12
triumph
over
the
Denver_Broncos
-
but
their
visit
will
be
a
short
one
.
The
Texans
have
two
more
road_games
-
at
Buffalo
and
Houston
-
before
they
play
for
the
home_folks
again
,
and
it
looks
as
if
coach
Hank_Stram
's
men
will
meet
the
Bills
just_as
they
are
developing
into
the
kind
of
team
they
were
expected
to
be
in
pre-season
reckonings
.
Buffalo
coach
Buster_Ramsey
,
who
has
become
one
of
the
game
's
greatest
collectors
of
quarterbacks
,
apparently
now
has
found
a
productive
pair
in
two
ex
National_Football_Leaguers
,
M._C._Reynolds
and
Warren_Rabb
.
Rabb
,
the
former
Louisiana_State
field_general
,
came_off
the
bench
for
his
debut
with
the
Bills
Sunday
and
directed
his
new
team
to
a
22
-
12
upset
victory
over
the
Houston_Oilers
,
defending
league
champions
.
``
Just
our
luck
''
!
exclaimed
Stram
.
``
Buster
would
solve
that
quarterback
problem
just_as
we
head
that
way
''
.
Ramsey
has
a
thing
or
two
to
mutter
about
himself
,
for
the
Dallas
defensive
unit
turned_in
another
splendid
effort
against
Denver
,
and
the
Texans
were
able
to
whip
the
dangerous
Broncs
without
the
fullbacking
of
a
top
star
,
Jack_Spikes
,
though
he
did
the
team
's
place-kicking
while
nursing
a
knee
injury
.
``
Our
interior
line
and
our
linebackers
played
exceptionally
well
''
,
said
Stram_Monday
after
he
and
his
staff
reviewed
movies
of
the
game
.
``
In_fact
our
whole
defensive
unit
did
a
good
job
''
.
The
Texans
won
the
game
through
ball
control
,
with
Quarterback
Cotton_Davidson
throwing
only
17
passes
.
``
We
always
like
to
keep
the
ball
as
much
as
we
can
against
Denver
because
they
have
such
an
explosive
attack
''
,
explained
Stram
.
``
They
can
be
going_along
,
doing
little
damage
,
then
bang
,
bang
-
they
can
hit
a_couple_of
passes
on
you
for
touchdowns
and
put
you
in_trouble
''
.
The
Broncs
did
hit
two
quick
strikes
in
the
final_period
against
the
Texans
,
but
Dallas
had
enough
of
a
lead
to
hold
them
off
.
The
principal
tactic
in
controlling
the
ball
was
giving
it
to
Abner_Haynes
,
the
flashy
halfback
.
He
was
called_upon
26
times
-
more
than
all_of
the
other
ball
carriers
combined
-
and
delivered
145
yards
.
The
Texans
made
themselves
a
comforting
break
on
the
opening
kickoff
when
Denver
's
Al_Carmichael
was
jarred
loose
from
the
ball
when
Dave_Grayson
,
the
speedy
halfback
,
hit
him
and
Guard
Al_Reynolds
claimed
it
for
Dallas
.
A
quick
touchdown
resulted
.
``
That
permitted
us
to
start
controlling
the
ball
right_away
''
,
said
Stram
,
quipping
,
``
I
think
I
'll
put
that
play
in
the
book
''
.
The
early
Southwest_Conference
football
leaders
-
Texas
,
Arkansas
and
Texas_A+M
-
made
a
big
dent
in
the
statistics
last
week
.
Texas
'
545
-
yard
spree
against
Washington_State
gave
the
Longhorns
a
3
-
game
total
offense
of
1512
yards
(
1065
rushing
and
447
passing
)
a
new
SWC
high
.
Arkansas
combined
280
yards
rushing
with
64
yards
passing
(
on
5
completions
in
7
tosses
)
and
a
tough
defense
to
whip
TCU
,
and
A+M
,
with
a
38
-
point
bulge
against
Texas_Tech
ran_up
its
biggest
total
loop
play
since
1950
.
Completing
12
of
15
passes
for
174
yards
,
the
Aggies
had
a
total
offense
of
361
yards
.
Texas
leads
in
per
game
rushing
averages
,
355
yards
,
and
passing
149
(
to
Baylor
's
126
)
,
but
idle
Baylor
has
the
best
defensive
record
(
187.5
yards
per
game
to
Texas
'
189
)
.
A+M
has
the
best
defense
against
passes
,
34.7
yards
per
game
.
Not
satisfied
with
various
unofficial
checks
on
the
liveliness
of
baseballs
currently
in_use
,
the
major_leagues
have
ordered
their
own
tests
