In
tradition
and
in
poetry
,
the
marriage_bed
is
a
place
of
unity
and
harmony
.
The
partners
each
bring
to
it
unselfish
love
,
and
each
takes_away
an
equal
share
of
pleasure
and
joy
.
At
its
most
ecstatic
moments
,
husband
and
wife
are
elevated
far
above
worldly
cares
.
Everything
else
is
closed
away
.
This
is
the
ideal
.
But
marriage
experts
say
that
such
mutual
contribution
and
mutual
joy
are
seldom
achieved
.
Instead
one
partner
or
the
other
dominates
the
sexual_relationship
.
In
the
past
,
it
has
been
the
husband
who
has
been
dominant
and
the
wife
passive
.
But
today
there
are
signs
that
these
roles
are
being
reversed
.
In
a
growing
number
of
American
homes
,
marriage
counselors
report
,
the
wife
is
taking
a
commanding
role
in
sexual_relationships
.
It
is
she
who
decides
the
time
,
the
place
,
the
surroundings
,
and
the
frequency
of
the
sexual
act
.
It
is
she
who
says
aye
or
nay
to
the
intimate
questions
of
sexual
technique
and
mechanics
-
not
the
husband
.
The
whole
act
is
tailored
to
her
pleasure
,
and
not
to
theirs
.
Beyond
a
certain
point
,
of_course
,
no
woman
can
be
dominant
-
nature
has
seen
to
that
.
But
there
is
little
doubt
that
in
many
marriages
the
wife
is
boss
of
the
marital
bed
.
Of_course
,
there
remain
many
``
old-fashioned
''
marriages
in
which
the
husband
maintains
his
supremacy
.
Yet
even
in
these
marriages
,
psychologists
say
,
wives
are
asserting
themselves
more
strongly
.
The
meekest
,
most
submissive
wife
of
today
is
a
tiger
by
her
mother
's
or
grandmother
's
standards
.
To
many
experts
,
this
trend
was
inevitable
.
They
consider
it
simply
a
sign
of
our
times
.
Our
society
has
``
emancipated
''
the
woman
,
giving
her
new
independence
and
new
authority
.
It
is
only
natural
that
she
assert
herself
in
the
sexual
role
.
``
The
sexual_relationship
does
not
exist
in
a
vacuum
''
,
declares
Dr._Mary_Steichen_Calderone
,
medical
director
of
the
Planned_Parenthood_Federation_of_America
and
author
of
the
recent
book
,
Release
From
Sexual
Tensions
.
``
It
reflects
what
is
going_on
in
other
areas
of
the
marriage
and
in
society
itself
.
A
world
in
which
wives
have
taken
a
more
active
role
is
likely
to
produce
sexual_relationships
in
which
wives
are
more
self-assertive
,
too
''
.
Yet
many
psychologists
and
marriage
counselors
agree
that
domination
of
the
sex
relationship
by
one
partner
or
the
other
can
be
unhealthy
and
even
dangerous
.
It
can
,
in_fact
,
wreck
a
marriage
.
When
a
husband
is
sexually
selfish
and
heedless
of
his
wife
's
desires
,
she
is
cheated
of
the
fulfillment
and
pleasure
nature
intended
for
her
.
And
she
begins
to
regard
him
as
savage
,
bestial
and
unworthy
.
On_the_other_hand
,
wifely
supremacy
demeans
the
husband
,
saps
his
self-respect
,
and
robs
him
of
his
masculinity
.
He
is
a
target
of
ridicule
to
his
wife
,
and
often
-
since
private
affairs
rarely
remain
private
-
to
the
outside
world
as_well
.
``
A
marriage
can
survive
almost
any
kind
of
stress
except
an
open
and
direct
challenge
to
the
husband
's
maleness
''
,
declares
Dr._Calderone
.
This
opinion
is
supported
by
one
of
the
nation
's
leading
psychiatrists
,
Dr._Maurice_E._Linden
,
director
of
the
Mental_Health_Division
of
the
Philadelphia_Department_of_Public_Health
.
``
When
the
roles
of
husband
and
wife
are
reversed
,
so
that
the
wife
becomes
leader
and
the
husband
follower
''
,
Dr._Linden
says
,
``
the
effects
on
their
whole
relationship
,
sexual
and
otherwise
,
can
be
disastrous
''
.
In
one
extreme
case
,
cited
by
a
Pittsburgh
psychologist
,
an
office
worker
's
wife
refused
to
have
sexual_relations
with
her
husband
unless
he
bought
her
the
luxuries
she
demanded
.
To
win
her
favors
,
her
husband
first
took
an
additional
job
,
then
desperately
began
to
embezzle
from
his
employer
.
Caught
at_last
,
he
was
sentenced
to
prison
.
While
he
was
in
custody
his
wife
divorced
him
.
More
typical
is
the
case
of
a
suburban
Long_Island
housewife
described
by
a
marriage
counselor
.
This
woman
repeatedly
complained
she
was
``
too
tired
''
for
marital
relations
.
To
please
her
,
her
husband
assumed
some
of
the
domestic
chores
.
Finally
,
he
was
cooking
,
washing
dishes
,
bathing
the
children
,
and
even
ironing
-
and
still
his
wife
refused
to
have
relations
as
often
as
he
desired
them
.
One
wife
,
described
by
a
New_York
psychologist
,
so
dominated
her
husband
that
she
actually
placed
their
sexual_relationship
on
a
schedule
,
writing
it
down
right
between
the
weekly
PTA
meetings
and
the
Thursday
night
neighborhood
card
parties
.
Another
put
sex
on
a
dollars
and
cents
basis
.
After
every
money
argument
,
she
rebuffed
her
husband
's
overtures
until
the
matter
was
settled
in
her
favor
.
Experts
say
the
partners
in
marriages
like
these
can
almost
be
typed
.
The
wife
is
likely
to
be
young
,
sophisticated
,
smart_as_a_whip
-
often
a
girl
who
has
sacrificed
a
promising
career
for
marriage
.
She
knows
the
power
of
the
sex
urge
and
how
to
use
it
to
manipulate
her
husband
.
The
husband
is
usually
a
well-educated
professional
,
preoccupied
with
his
job
-
often
an
organization
man
whose
motto
for
getting_ahead
is
:
``
Do
n't
rock_the_boat
''
.
Sometimes
this
leads
to
his
becoming
demandingly
dominant
in
marriage
.
Hemmed_in
on
the
job
and
unable
to
assert
himself
,
he
uses
the
sex_act
so
he
can
be
supreme
in
at_least
one
area
.
More
often
,
though
,
he
is
so
accustomed
to
submitting
to
authority
on
the
job
without
argument
that
he
lives
by
the
same
rule
at
home
.
Some
psychologists
,
in_fact
,
suggest
that
career
bound
husbands
often
are
more
to
blame
for
topsy-turvy
marriages
than
their
wives
.
The
wife
's
attempt
at
control
,
these
psychologists
contend
,
is
sometimes
merely
a
pathetic
effort
to
compel
her
husband
to
pay
as
much
attention
to
her
as
he
does
to
his
job
.
Naturally
no
woman
can
ever
completely
monopolize
the
sexual
initiative
.
Unless
her
husband
also
desires
sex
,
the
act
cannot
be
consummated
.
Generally
,
however
,
in
such
marriages
as
those
cited
,
the
husband
is
at
his
wife
's
mercy
.
``
The
pattern
''
,
says
Dr._Morton_Schillinger
,
psychologist
at
New_York
's
Lincoln_Institute_for_Psychotherapy
,
``
is
for
the
husband
to
hover
about
anxiously
and
eagerly
,
virtually
trembling
in
his
hope
that
she
will
flash
him
the
signal
that
tonight
is
the
night
''
.
No
one
seriously
contends
,
of_course
,
that
the
domineering
wife
is
,
sexually
speaking
,
a
new
character
in
our
world
.
After_all
,
the
henpecked
husband
with
his
shrewish
wife
is
a
comic
figure
of
long
standing
,
in
literature
and
on
the
stage
,
as
Dr._Schillinger
points_out
.
There
is
no
evidence
that
these
Milquetoasts
became
suddenly
emboldened
when
they
crossed
the
threshhold
of
the
master_bedroom
.
Furthermore
,
Dr._Calderone
says
,
a
certain
number
of
docile
,
retiring
men
always
have
been
around
.
They
are
n't
``
frigid
''
and
they
are
n't
homosexual
;
they
're
just
restrained
in
all
of
life
.
They
like
to
be
dominated
.
One
such
man
once
confided
to
Dr._Theodor_Reik
,
New_York
psychiatrist
,
that
he
preferred
to
have
his
wife
the
sexual
aggressor
.
Asked
why
,
he
replied
primly
:
``
Because
that
's
no
activity
for
a
gentleman
''
.
But
such
cases
were
,
in
the
past
,
unusual
.
Society
here
and
abroad
has
been
built
around
the
dominating
male
-
even
the
Bible
appears
to
endorse
the
concept
.
Family
survival
on
our
own
Western
frontier
,
for_example
,
could
quite
literally
depend_on
a
man
's
strength
and
ability
to
bring_home_the_bacon
;
and
the
dependent
wife
seldom
questioned
his
judgment
about
anything
,
including
the
marriage
bed
.
This
carried_over
into
the
more
urbanized
late
19
th
and
early
20
th
centuries
,
when
the
man
ruled
the
roost
in
the
best
bull_roaring
Life_With_Father
manner
.
In
those
days
,
a
wife
had
mighty
few
rights
in
the
domestic
sphere
and
even
fewer
in
the
sexual
sphere
.
``
Grandma
was
n't
expected
to
like
it
''
,
Dr._Marion_Hilliard
,
the
late
Toronto
gynecologist
,
once
summed_up
the
attitude
of
the
'
90
s
.
Wives
of
the
period
shamefacedly
thought_of
themselves
as
``
used
''
by
their
husbands
-
and
,
history
indicates
,
they
often
quite
literally
were
.
When
was
the
turning_point
?
When
did
women
begin
to
assert
themselves
sexually
?
Some
date
it
from
woman
suffrage
,
others
from
when
women
first
began
to
challenge
men
in
the
marketplace
,
still
others
from
the
era
of
the
emancipated
flapper
and
bathtub_gin
.
Virtually
everyone
agrees
,
however
,
that
the
trend
toward
female
sexual
aggressiveness
was
tremendously
accelerated
with
the
postwar
rush
to
the
suburbs
.
Left
alone
while
her
husband
was
miles
away
in
the
city
,
the
modern
wife
assumed
more
and
more
duties
normally
reserved
for
the
male
.
Circumstances
gave
her
almost
undisputed
sway
over
child
rearing
,
money
handling
and
home
maintenance
.
She
found
she
could
cope_with
all
kinds
of
problems
for
which
she
was
once
considered
too
helpless
.
She
liked
this
taste
of
authority
and
independence
,
and
,
with
darkness
,
was
not
likely
to
give
it
up
.
``
Very
few
wives
''
,
says
Dr._Calderone
,
``
who
balance
the
checkbook
,
fix
the
car
,
choose
where
the
family
will
live
and
deal
with
the
tradesmen
,
are
suddenly
going_to
become
submissive
where
sex
is
concerned
.
A
woman
who
dominates
other
family
affairs
will
dominate
the
sexual_relationship
as_well
''
.
And
an
additional
factor
was
helping
to
make
women
more
sexually
self-assertive
-
the
comparatively
recent
discovery
of
the
true
depths
of
female
desire
and
response
.
Marriage
manuals
and
women
's
magazine_articles
began
to
stress
the
importance
of
the
female
climax
.
They
began
to
describe
in_detail
the
woman
's
capacity
for
response
.
In_fact
,
the
noted
psychologist
and
sex
researcher
,
Dr._Albert_Ellis
,
has
declared
flatly
that
women
are
``
sexually
superior
''
to
men
.
According
to
Dr._Ellis
,
the
average
20
-
year
old
American
woman
is
capable
of
far
greater
sexual_arousal
than
her
partner
.
Not
surprisingly
,
Dr._Ellis
says
,
some
recently
enlightened
wives
are
out_to
claim
these
capabilities
.
Yet
,
paradoxically
,
according
to
Dr._Maurice_Linden
,
many
wives
despise
their
husbands
for
not
standing_up
to
them
.
An
aggressive
woman
wants
a
man
to
demand
,
not
knuckle_under
.
``
When
the
husband
becomes
passive
in_the_face_of
his
wife
's
aggressiveness
''
,
Dr._Linden
says
,
``
the
wife
,
in_turn
,
finds
him
inadequate
.
Often
she
fails
to
gain
sexual
satisfaction
''
.
One
such
wife
,
Dr._Linden
says
,
became
disgusted
with
her
weak
husband
and
flurried
through
a
series
of
extramarital
affairs
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
stronger
man
.
But
her
personality
was
such_that
each
affair
lasted
only
until
that
lover
,
too
,
had
been
conquered
and
reduced
to
passivity
.
Then
the
wife
bed_hopped
to
the
next
on
the
list
.
In
some
cases
,
however
,
domination
of
the
sex_act
by
one
partner
can
be
temporary
,
triggered
by
a
passing
but
urgent
emotional
need
.
Thus
a
man
who
is
butting_a_stone_wall
at
the
office
may
become
unusually
aggressive
in
bed
-
the
one
place
he
can
still
be
champion
.
If
his
on-the-job
problems
work_out
,
he
may
return
to
his
old
pattern
.
Sometimes
a
burst
of
aggressiveness
will
sweep_over
a
man
-
or
his
wife
-
because
he
or
she
feels
age
creeping_up
.
On_the_other_hand
,
a
husband
who
always
has
been
vigorous
and
assertive
may
suddenly
become
passive
-
asking
,
psychologists
say
,
for
reassurance
that
his
wife
still
finds
him
desirable
.
Or
a
wife
may
make
sudden
demands
that
she
be
courted
,
flattered
or
coaxed
,
simply
because
she
needs
her
ego
lifted
.
In_any_case
,
Dr._Calderone
remarks
,
such
problems
are
a
couple
's
own
affair
,
and
can
n't
always
be
measured
by
a
general
yardstick
.
``
As_long_as
the
couple
is
in_agreement
in
their
approach
to
sex
,
it
makes
little
difference
if
one
or
the
other
dominates
''
,
Dr._Calderone
declares
.
``
The
important
point
is
that
both
be
satisfied
with
the
adjustment
''
.
Other
experts
say
,
however
,
that
if
sexual
domination
by
one
or
the
other
partner
exists
for
longer
than
a
brief
period
,
it
is
likely
to
shake
the
marriage
.
And
just
as
domination
today
often
begins
with
the
wife
,
so
the
cure
generally
must
lie
with
the
husband
.
``
To
get
a
marriage
back
where
it
belongs
''
,
comments
Dr._Schillinger
of
the
Lincoln_Institute
,
``
the
husband
must
take
some
very
basic
steps
.
He
must
begin
,
paradoxically
,
by
becoming
more
selfish
.
He
must
become
more
expressive
of
his
own
desires
,
more
demanding
and
less
'
understanding
''
'
.
Too
many
husbands
,
Dr._Schillinger
continues
,
worry
about
``
how
well
they
're
doing
''
,
and
fear
that
their
success
depends_on
some
trick
or
technique
of
sexual
play
.
