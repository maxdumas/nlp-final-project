Miraculously
,
she
found
exactly
the
right
statement
.
She
began
it
deliberately
,
so
that
none
of
her
words
would
be
lost
on
him
.
``
I
want
to
tell
you
something
Thomas_DeMontez_Lord
.
I
'm
well
aware
that
you
've
got
a
pedigree
as
long
as
my
leg
,
and
that
I
do
n't
amount
to
anything
.
But
''
-
``
But
it
do
n't
matter
a-tall
''
,
Lord
supplied
fondly
.
``
To
me
you
'll
always
be
the
girl
o
'
my
dreams
,
an
'
the
sweetest
flower
that
grows
''
.
Beaming
idiotically
,
he
pooched
out
his
lips
and
attempted
to
kiss
her
.
She
yanked
away
from
him
furiously
.
``
You
shut_up
!
shu-tt
up-pp
!
I
've
got
something
to
say
to
you
,
and
by
God
you
're
going
to
listen
.
Do
you
hear
me
?
You
're
going
to
listen
''
!
Lord
nodded
agreeably
.
He
said
he
wanted
very_much
to
listen
.
He
knew
that
anything
a
brainy
little
lady
like
her
had
to
say
would
be
plumb
important
,
as_well_as
pleasin
'
to
the
ear
,
and
he
did
n't
want
to
miss
a
word
of_it
.
So
would
she
mind
speaking
a_little
louder
?
``
I
think
you
stink
,
Tom_Lord
!
I
think
you
're
mean
and
hateful
and
stupid
,
and
-
louder
''
?
said
Joyce
.
``
Uh-huh
.
So
I
can
hear
you
while
I
'm
checkin
'
the
car
.
Looks
like
we
might
be
in_for
a
speck
of
trouble
''
.
He
opened
the
door
and
got_out
.
He
waited
at
the
car
side
for
a
moment
,
looking
down
at
her
expectantly
.
``
Well
?
Was
n't
you
goin
'
to
say
somethin
''
'
?
Then
,
helpfully
,
as
she
merely
stared
at
him
in
weary
silence
,
``
Maybe
you
could
write
it
down
for
me
,
huh
?
Print
it
in
real
big
letters
,
an
'
I
can
cipher
it
out
later
''
.
``
Aah
,
go_on
''
,
she
said
.
``
Just
go
the
hell
on
''
.
He
grinned
,
nodded
,
and
walked_around
to
the
front
of
the
car
.
Lips
pursed
mournfully
,
he
stared
down
at
its
crazily
sagging
left
side
.
Then
he
hunkered_down
on
the
heels
of
his
handmade
boots
,
peered
into
the
orderly
chaos
of
axle
,
shock_absorber
,
and
spring
.
He
went
prone
on
his
stomach
,
the_better
to
pursue
his
examination
.
After
a
time
,
he
straightened
again
,
brushing
the
red
Permian
dust
from
his
hands
,
slapping
it
from
his
six
dollar
levis
and
his
tailored
,
twenty-five
dollar
shirt
.
He
wore
no
gun
-
a
strange
ommission
for
a
peace_officer
in
this
country
.
Never
,
he
'd
once
told
Joyce
,
had
he
encountered
any
man
or
situation
that
called_for
a
gun
.
And
he
really
feels
that
way
,
she
thought
.
That
's
really
all
he
's
got
,
all
he
is
.
Just
a
big
pile
of
self-confidence
in
an
almost
teensy
package
.
If
I
could
make
myself
feel
the
same
way
.
She
studied
him
hopefully
,
yearningly
;
against
the
limitless
background
of
sky
and
wasteland
it
was
easy
to
confirm
her
analysis
.
Here
in
the
God-forsaken
place
,
the
westerly
end
of
nowhere
,
Tom_Lord
looked
almost
insignificant
,
almost
contemptible
.
He
was
handsome
,
with
his
coal-black
hair
and
eyes
,
his
fine
chiseled
features
.
But
she
'd
known
plenty
of
handsomer
guys
,
and
,
conceding
his
good_looks
,
what
was
there
left
?
He
was
n't
a
big
man
;
rather
on
the
medium
side
.
Neither
was
he
very
powerful
of
build
.
He
could
move
very
quickly
,
she
knew
(
although
he
seldom
found
occasion
to
do
so
)
,
but
he
was
more
wiry
than
truly
strong
.
And
his
relatively
small
hands
and
feet
gave
him
an
almost
delicate
appearance
.
Just
nothing
,
she
told
herself
.
Just
so
darned
sure
of
himself
that
he
puts_the_Indian_sign
on
everyone
.
But
,
by
gosh
,
I
want
him
and
I
'm
going_to
have
him
!
He
caught
her
eye
,
came_back
around
the
car
with
the
boot
wearer
's
teetering
,
half
mincing
walk
.
Why
did
these
yokels
still
wear
boots
,
anyway
,
when
most
had
scarcely
sat
a
horse
in
years
?
He
slid
in
at
her
side
,
tucked
a
cigar
into
his
mouth
,
and
politely
proffered
one
to
her
.
``
Oh
,
cut_it_out
,
Tom
''
!
she
snapped
.
``
Ca
n't
you
stop
that
stupid
clowning
for
even
a
minute
''
?
``
This
ai
n't
your
brand
,
maybe
''
,
Lord
suggested
.
``
Or
maybe
you
just
do
n't
feel_like
a
cigar
''
?
``
I
feel_like
getting_back
to
town
,
that
's
what
I
feel_like
!
Now
,
are
you
going_to
take
me
or
am
I
supposed_to
walk
''
?
``
Might
get
there
faster
walkin
''
'
,
Lord
drawled
,
``
seein
'
as
how
I
got
a
busted
front
spring
.
On_the_other_hand
,
howsomever
,
maybe
you
would
n't
either
.
I
figger
it
's
probl_'_y
a
sixty-five
mile
walk
,
and
I
c_'_n
maybe
get
this
spring
patched_up
in
a_couple_of
hours
''
.
``
How
-
with
what
?
There
's
nothing
out
here
but
rattlesnakes
''
.
``
Now
,
ai
n't
it
the
truth
''
?
Lord
laughed
with
secret
amusement
.
``
Not
a
danged
thing
but
rattlesnakes
,
so
I
reckon
I
'll
get
the
boss
rattler
to
help
me
''
.
``
Tom
!
For_God
's
sake
''
!
``
Looky
''
.
He
pointed
,
cutting
her
off
.
``
See
that
wildcat
''
?
She
saw
it
then
,
the
distant
derrick
of
the
wildcat
-
a
test
well
in
unexplored
country
.
And
even
with
her
limited
knowledge
of
such
things
,
she
knew
that
the
car
could
be
repaired
there
;
sufficiently
,
at_least
,
to
get
them
back
into
town
.
A
wildcatter
had
to
be
prepared
for
almost
any
emergency
.
He
had_to
depend_on
himself
,
since
he
was
invariably
miles
and
hours
away
from
others
.
``
Well
,
let
's
get_going
''
,
she
said
impatiently
.
``
I
''
-
She
broke_off
,
frowning
.
``
What
did
you
mean
by
that
rattlesnake
gag
?
Getting
the
boss
rattlesnake
to
help
you
''
?
``
Why
,
I
meant
what
I
said
''
,
Lord
declared
.
``
What
else
would
I
mean
,
anyways
''
?
She
looked
at
him
,
lips
compressed
.
Then
,
with
a
shrug
of
pretended
indifference
,
she
took
a
compact
from
her
purse
and
went_through_the_motions
of
fixing
her
make-up
.
In
his
mood
,
it
was
the
best
way
to
handle
him
;
that_is
,
to
show
no
curiosity
whatsoever
.
Otherwise
,
she
would
be
baited
into
a
tantrum
-
teased
and
provoked
until
she
lost
control
of
herself
,
and
thus
lost
still
another
battle
in
the
maddening
struggle
of
Tom_Lord
Vs.
Joyce_Lakewood
.
The
car
lurched
along
at
a
snail
's
crawl
,
the
left
front
mudguard
banging
and
scraping
against
the
tire
,
occasionally
scraping
against
the
road
itself
.
Lord
whistled
tunelessly
as
he
fought
the
steering_wheel
.
He
seemed
very
pleased
with
himself
,
as
though
some
intricate
scheme
was
working_out
exactly
as
he
had
planned
.
Along
with
this
self-satisfaction
,
however
,
Joyce
sensed
a
growing
tension
.
It
poured
out
of
him
like
an
electric_current
,
a
feeling
that
the
muscles
and
nerves
of
his
fine
drawn
body
were
coiling
for
action
,
and
that
that
action
would
be
all
that
he
anticipated
.
Joyce
had
seen
him
like
this
once
before
-
more_than
once
,
actually
,
but
on
one
particularly
memorable
occasion
.
That
was
the
day
that
he
had
practically
mopped_up
the
main_street
of
Big_Sands
with
Aaron_McBride
,
field
boss
for
the
Highlands_Oil_+_Gas_Company
.
Tom
had
been
laying
for
Aaron_McBride
for
a
long_time
,
just
waiting
to
catch
him
out
of
line
.
McBride
gave
him
his
opportunity
when
he
showed_up
in
town
with
a
pistol
on
his
hip
.
He
had
a
legitimate
reason
for
wearing
it
.
It
was
payday
for
Highlands
,
and
he
was
packing
a
lot
of
money
back
into
the
oil_fields
.
Moreover
,
as_long_as
the
weapon
was
carried
openly
,
the
sheriff
's
office
had
made
no
previous
issue
of_it
.
``
So
what
's
this
all
about
''
?
he
demanded
,
when
Lord
confronted
him
.
I
'm
not
the
only
man
in
town
with
a
gun
,
or
the
only
one
without
a
permit
``
.
It
was
the
wrong
thing
to
say
.
By
failing
to
do
as
he
was
told
instantly
-
to
take_out
a
permit
or
return
the
gun
to
his
car
-
he
had
played
into
Lord
's
hands
.
The
trouble
was
that
he
had
virtually
had_to
protest
.
The
deputy
had
forced
him
to
by
his
manner
of
accosting
him
.
So
,
``
How
about
it
''
?
he
said
.
``
Why
single
me
out
on
this
permit
deal
''
?
``
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
about
that
''
,
Lord
told
him
.
``
We
aim
t
'
be
see-lective
,
y_'_know
?
Do
n't
like
to
bother
no_one
unless
we
have
to
,
which
I
figger
we
do
,
in
your
case
.
Figger
we
got_to
be
plumb
careful
with
any
of
you
Highlands
big_shots
''
.
McBride
reddened
.
He
himself
had
heard
that
there
was
gangster
money
in
the
company
,
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
.
He
was
an
honest
man
doing
a
hard
job
,
and
the
implication
that
he
was
anything
else
was
unbearable
.
``
Look
,
Lord
''
,
he
said
hoarsely
.
``
I
know
you
've_got
a
grudge
against
me
,
and
maybe
I
can
n't
blame
you
.
You
think
that
Highlands
swindled
you
and
I
helped
'
em
do
it
.
But
you
're
all
wrong
,
man
!
I
'm
no
lawyer
.
I
just
do
what
I
'm
told
,
and
''
-
``
Uh-huh
.
An
'
that
could
mean
trouble
with
a
fella
that
's
workin
'
for
crooks
.
So
you
get_rid_of
that
pistol
right
now
,
Mis-ter_McBride
.
You
do
that
or
take
you
out
a
permit
right
now
''
.
McBride
could
n't
do
either
,
of_course
.
Not
immediately
,
as
the
deputy
demanded
.
Not
without
a
face-saving
respite
of
at_least
a_few
minutes
.
To
do
so
would
make
his
job
well-nigh
impossible
.
Oil-field
workers
were
a
rough
tough
lot
.
How
could
he
exert
authority
over
them
-
make
them
toe_the_line
,
as
he
had
to
-
if
he
knuckled_under
to
this
small-town
clown
?
``
I
'll
get_around_to
it
a_little
later
''
,
he
mumbled
desperately
.
``
Just
as_soon_as
I
go
to
the
bank
,
and
''
-
``
Huh-uh
.
Now
,
Mis-ter_McBride
''
,
said
Lord
,
and
he
laid
a
firmly
restraining
hand
on
the
field
boss
's
arm
.
It
was
strictly
the
deputy
's
game
,
but
McBride
had
gone
too
far
to
throw_in
.
Now
,
he
could
only
play
the
last
card
in
what
was
probably
the
world
's
coldest
deck
.
He
flung
off
Lord
's
hand
and
attempted
to
push
past
him
,
inadvertently
shoving
him
into
a
storefront
.
It
was
practically
the
last
move
that
McBride
made
of
his
own
volition
.
Lord
slugged
him
in
the
stomach
,
so
hard
that
the
organ
almost
pressed
against
his
spine
.
Then
,
as
he
doubled
,
gasping
,
vomiting
the
breakfast
he
had
so
lately
eaten
,
Lord
straightened
him
with
an
uppercut
.
A
rabbit_punch
redoubled
him
.
And_then
there
was
a
numbing
blow
to
the
heart
,
and
another
gut
flattening
blow
to
the
stomach
.
But
he
could
n't
keep_up
with
them
.
No_more
could
he
defend
himself
against
them
.
He
seemed
to
be
fighting
not
one
man
but
a
dozen
.
And
he
could
no_longer
think_of
face-saving
,
of
honor
,
but
only
of
escape
.
Why
,
he
's
going
to
kill
me
,
he
thought
wildly
.
I
meant
him
no
harm
.
I
've
given
willful
hurt
to
no
man
.
I
was
just
doing
my
job
,
just
following
orders
,
and
for
that
he
's
going
to
kill
me
.
Beat
me
to
death
in_front_of
a_hundred
people
.
Somehow
more
terrible
than
the
certainty
that
he
was
about
to
die
was
the
knowledge
that
Lord
would
probably
not
suffer
for
it
:
the
murder
would
go
unpunished
.
He
,
McBride
,
would
be
cited
as
in
the
wrong
,
and
he
,
Lord
,
would
go
scot-free
,
an
officer
who
had
only
done
his
duty
,
though
perhaps
too
energetically
.
McBride
staggered
into
the
street
,
flopped
sprawling
in
the
stinging
dust
.
Fear
maddened
,
fleeing
the
lengthening
shadow
of
death
,
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
again
.
He
could
n't
see
;
he
was
long
past
the
point
of
coherent
thinking
.
Dimly
,
he
heard
laughter
,
hoots
of
derision
,
but
he
could
not
read
the
racket
properly
.
He
could
not
grasp
that
Lord
had
withdrawn
from
the
fight
minutes
ago
,
and
that
his
leaden
arms
were
flailing
at
nothing
but
the
air
.
He
hated
them
too_much
to
understand
-
the
people
of_this
isolated
law
unto
itself
world
that
was
Lord
's
world
.
This
,
he
was
sure
,
was
the
way
they
would
act
;
laughing_at
a
dying
man
,
laughing
as
a
man
was
beaten
to
death
.
And
nothing
would
be
done
about
it
.
Nothing
unless
&
&
&
.
Donna
!
Donna
,
his
young
wife
,
the
girl
who
was
both
daughter
and
wife
to
him
.
Donna
was
like
he
was
.
She
lived
by
the
rules
,
never
compromising
,
never
blinded
or
diverted
by
circumstance
.
And
Donna
would
-
When
he
regained
consciousness
he
was
in
Lord
's
house
,
in
the
office
of
Doctor_Lord
,
the
deputy
's
deceased
father
.
