``
The
present
recovery
movement
will
gather
steady
momentum
to
lift
the
economy
to
a
new
historic
peak
by
this
autumn
''
,
Beryl_W._Sprinkel
,
economist
of
Harris_Trust
+
Savings_Bank
,
Chicago
,
predicted
at
the
closing
session
here
Tuesday
of
Investment_Bankers
Assn.
,
California
group
,
conference
.
Another
speaker
,
William_H._Draper
,
Jr.
,
former
Under
Secretary
of
the
Army
and
now
with
the
Palo_Alto
venture_capital
firm
of
Draper
,
Gaither
+
Anderson
,
urged
the
U._S.
to
``
throw
down
the
gauntlet
of
battle
to
communism
and
tell
Moscow
bluntly
we
won
n't
be
pushed
arouny
any_more
''
.
He
urged
support
for
President_Kennedy
's
requests
for
both
defense
and
foreign
aid
appropriations
.
Sprinkel
told
conferees
that
the
recent
improvement
in
economic
activity
was
not
a
``
temporary
flash
in
the
pan
''
but
the
beginning
of
a
substantial
cyclical
expansion
that
will
carry
the
economy
back
to
full
employment
levels
and
witness
a
renewal
of
our
traditional
growth
pattern
.
``
In_view
of
the
current
expansion
,
which
promises
to
be
substantial
''
he
said
the
odds
appear
to
favor
rising
interest_rates
in
coming
months
,
but
``
there
is
reason
to
believe
the
change
will
not
be
as
abrupt
as
in
1958
nor
as
severe
as
in
late
1959
and
1960
''
.
Sprinkel
strongly
refuted
the
current
neo-stagnationist
thesis
that
we
are
facing
a
future
of
limited
and
slow
growth
,
declaring
that
this
pessimism
``
is
based
on
very
limited
and
questionable
evidence
''
.
Rather_than
viewing
the
abortive
recovery
in
1959
-
60
as
a
reason
for
believing
we
have
lost
prospects
for
growth
``
,
he
said
''
it
should
be
viewed_as
a
lesson
well
learned
which
will
increase
the
probability
of
substantial
improvement
in_this
recovery
``
.
He
cautioned
that
``
the
greater
danger
in_this
recovery
may
be
excessive
stimulation
by
government
which
could
bring
moderate
inflation
''
.
The
economist
does
not
look_for
a
drastic
switch
in
the
budget
during
this
recovery
and
believes
it
``
even
more
unlikely
that
the
Federal_Reserve
will
aggressively
tighten
monetary
policy
in
the
early
phases
of
the
upturn
as
was
the
case
in
1958
''
.
The
unsatisfactory
1958
-
60
expansion
,
he
said
,
was
not_due
to
inadequate
growth
forces
inherent
in
our
economy
but
rather
to
the
adverse
effect
of
inappropriate
economic_policies
combined
with
retrenching
decisions
resulting
from
the
steel
strike
.
Draper
declared
,
``
As
I
see
it
,
this
country
has
never
faced
such
great
dangers
as
threaten
us
today
.
We
must
justify
our
heritage
.
We
must
be
ready
for
any
needed
sacrifice
''
.
He
said
that
from
his
experience
of
two
years
with
Gen._Clay
in
West_Berlin
administration
,
that
``
Russia
respects
our
show
of
strength
,
but
that
presently
we
're
not
acting
as
we
should
and
must
''
.
He
called
the
Cuban
tractor
plan
an
outright
blackmail
action
,
and
noted
that
in
war
``
you
can
n't
buy
yourself
out
and
that
's
what
we
're
trying
to
do
''
.
While
he
declined
to
suggest
,
how
,
he
said
that
sooner_or_later
we
must
get_rid_of
Castro
,
``
for
unless
we
do
we
're
liable_to
face
similar
situations
in_this
hemisphere
.
Its
the
start
of
a
direct
threat
to
our
own
security
and
I
do
n't
believe
we
can
permit
that
''
.
Stock_market
Tuesday
staged
a
technical
recovery
,
erasing
all_of
Monday
's
losses
in
the
Associated_Press
average
and
making
the
largest
gain
in
about
two_weeks
.
Analysts
saw
the
move
as
a
continuation
of
the
recovery
drive
that
got
under
way
late
Monday
afternoon
when
the
list
sank
to
a
hoped-for
``
support
level
''
represented
by
around
675
in
the
Dow_Jones
industrial
average
.
It
was
a_level
at
which
some
of
the
investors
standing
on
the
sidelines
were
thought
likely
to
buy
the
pivotal
issues
represented
in
the
averages
.
Although
it
looked_like
a
routine
technical
snapback
to
Wall_Streeters
it
was
accompanied
by
some
good
news
.
A
substantial
rise
in
new
orders
and
sales
of
durable_goods
was
reported
for
last
month
.
Treasury_Secretary_Douglas_Dillon
said
the
economy
is
expected
to
advance
by
a
whopping
8
%
next
year
,
paving_the_way
for
lower
taxes
.
The
Dow_Jones
industrial
average
advanced
7.19
to
687.87
.
Of
1253
issues
traded
,
695
advanced
and
354
declined
.
New
highs
for
the
year
totaled
nine
and
new
lows
14
.
Trading
was
comparatively
dull
throughout
the
day
.
Volume
dipped
to
3.28
million
shares
from
3.98
million
Monday
.
A
$
25
billion
advertising
budget
in
an
$
800
billion
economy
was
envisioned
for
the
1970
s
here
Tuesday
by
Peter_G._Peterson
,
head
of
one
of
the
world
's
greatest
camera
firms
,
in
a
key
address
before
the
American_Marketing_Assn.
.
However
,
Peterson
,
president
of
Bell
+
Howell
,
warned
800
U._S.
marketing
leaders
attending
a
national
conference
at
the
Ambassador
,
that
the
future
will
belong
to
the
industrialist
of
creative
and
``
unconventional
wisdom
''
.
``
As
we
look_to
the
$
800
billion
economy
that_is
predicted
for
1970
and
the
increase
of
about
40
%
in
consumer
expenditures
that
will
be
required
to
reach
that
goal
,
management
can
well
be
restless
about
how
this
tremendous
volume
and
number
of
new
products
will
be
created
and
marketed
''
,
Peterson
said
.
``
With
this
kind_of
new
product
log-jam
,
the
premium
for
brilliant
product
planning
will
obviously
go_up
geometrically
''
.
The
executive
paid
tribute
to
research
and
development
and
technology
for
their
great
contributions
in_the_past
,
but
he
also
cautioned
industry
that
they
tend
to
be
great
equalizers
because
they
move
at
a
fairly
even
pace
within
an
industry
and
fail
to
give
it
the
short-term
advantage
which
it
often
needs
.
Peterson
said
America
has
nothing
to
fear
in
world
competition
if
it
dares
to
be
original
in
both
marketing
and
product
ideas
.
He
cited
,
as
an
example
,
how
the
American
camera
industry
has
been
able
to
meet
successfully
the
competition
of
Japan
despite
lower
Japanese
labor
costs
,
by
improving
its
production
know-how
and
technology
.
He
also
used
as
an
example
the
manufacturer
who
introduced
an
all-automatic
camera
in
Germany
,
with
the
result
that
it
became
the
best
selling
camera
in
the
German
market
.

Write
to
the

's
custodian
bank
-
the
First
National_Bank
of

That

handles
most_of
the
paper
work
for
Diversified
Growth_Stock
Fund
,
Fundamental
Investors
,
Diversified_Investment_Fund
and
Television-Electronics_Fund
.
The
bank
installed
a
magnetic_tape
electronic_data_processing
system
to
handle
things
.
But
it
seems
that
this
``
electronic
brain
''
was
n't
``
programmed
''
correctly
.
This
resulted
in
a
great
number
of
errors
.
And
letters
began
to
come_in
to
this
column
from
irate
shareholders
.
I
visited
the
bank
in
March
and
wrote
a
story
about
the
situation
.
At_that_time
,
the
people
at
the
bank
said
they
felt
that
they
had
the
situation
in_hand
.
They
indicated
that
no
new
errors
were
being
made
and
that
all
old
errors
would
be
corrected
``
within
60
days
''
.
That
60
-
day
period
is
over
and
letters
are
still
coming_in
from
shareholders
of
these
four
funds
,
complaining
about
mistakes
in
their
accounts
.
Maybe
it
's
taking
longer
to
get
things
squared_away
than
the
bankers
expected
.
Any
shareholder
of
any
of
these
funds
who
finds
a
mistake
in
his
account
certainly
should
get_in_touch
with
the
bank

Alfred_Hayes
,
president
of
the
Federal_Reserve_Bank
of
New_York
,
said
Tuesday
``
there
is
no
present
need
for
far-reaching
reforms
''
which
would
basically
alter
the
international
financial
system
.
Hayes
said
that
if
a
way
can
be
found
to
deal
effectively
with
short-term
capital
movements
between
nations
,
``
there
is
no
reason
,
in
my
judgment
why
the
international
financial
system
cannot
work
satisfactorily
for
at_least
the
foreseeable
future
''
.
New_York
Central_Railroad
president
Alfred_E._Perlman
said
Tuesday
his
line
would
face
the
threat
of
bankruptcy
if
the
Chesapeake
+
Ohio
and
Baltimore
+
Ohio
Railroads
merge
.
Perlman
said
bankruptcy
would
not
be
an
immediate
effect
of
the
merger
,
but
could
possibly
be
an
ultimate
effect
.
The
railroad
president
made
the
statement
in
an
interview
as
the
Interstate_Commerce_Commission
opened
Round
2
of
its
hearing
into
the
C
+
O
's
request
to
control
and_then
merge
with
the
B
+
O
.
``
All
these
kind_of
things
weaken
us
''
,
Perlman
said
.
Board_Chairman_Howard_Simpson
of
the
Baltimore
+
Ohio_Railroad_Co.
,
testified
the
B
+
O
was
in
its
worst
financial_condition
since
the
depression
years
and
badly
needed
the
economic
lift
it
would
get
from
consolidation
with
the
Chesapeake
+
Ohio_Railroad
.
``
The
financial
situation
of
the
Baltimore
+
Ohio
,
has
become
precarious
-
much
worse
than
at_any_time
since
the
depression
of
the
1930
s
''
,
he
told
the
hearing
.
C
+
O
president
Walter_J._Tuohy
was
summoned
back
for
cross-examination
by
New_York
Central
attorneys
before
examiner
John_Bradford
who
is
hearing
the
complex
case
.
The
New_York
Central
also
has
asked
the
ICC
to
permit
it
to
gain
control
of
the
B
+
O
.
Central
was
rebuffed
by
the
other
two
railroads
in
previous
attempts
to
make
it
a
three-way
merger
.
The
proposed
C
+
O
-
B
+
O
railroad
would
make
it
the
hemisphere
's
second
largest
.
The
government
's
short-term
borrowing_costs
rose
with
Tuesday
weekly
offering
of
Treasury_bills
.
On
$
1.1
billion
of
90
-
day
bills
,
the
average
yield
was
2.325
%
.
The
rate
a
week
ago
was
2.295
%
.
``
Consumer
uncertain
about
economic_conditions
''
.
This
was
the
chief
reason
for
a
so-so
sales
outlook
given
by
two-thirds
of
56
builders
polled
by
the
National_Housing_Center
.
Other
reasons
mentioned
by
one-third
or
more
of
the
builders
were
``
resistance
to
high
interest_rates
,
cost
advantage
of
buying
over
renting
has
narrowed
,
shelter
market
nearing
saturation
and
prospects
unable
to
qualify
''
.
The
poll
was
taken
at
the
Center
's
annual
builders
'
intentions
conference
.
It
disclosed
that
the
builders
:
Expect
their
own
production
volume
,
and
presumably
sales
,
to
jump
30
percent
in
1961
.
Look_for
home
building
nationally
to
advance
less_than
10
percent
this
year
from
1960
's
1257700
0
non-farm
housing
starts
.
The
industry
has
said
1960
was
a
poor
year
.
Starts
were
down
20
percent
from
1959
.
Why
the
discrepancy
between
the
builders
'
forecasts
for
themselves
and
for
the
industry
?
The
reason
,
says
the
Housing_Center
,
is
that
the
builders
invited
to
the
intentions
conference
``
are
generally
among
the
more
successful
businessmen
,
and
usually
do
somewhat
better
than
their
fellow
builders
''
.
