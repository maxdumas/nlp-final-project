The_most
positive
element
to
emerge
from
the
Oslo
meeting
of
North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization
Foreign_Ministers
has
been
the
freer
,
franker
,
and
wider
discussions
,
animated
by
much
better
mutual_understanding
than
in
past
meetings
.
This
has
been
a
working
session
of
an
organization
that
,
by
its
very
nature
,
can
only
proceed
along
its
route
step_by_step
and
without
dramatic
changes
.
In
Oslo
,
the
ministers
have
met
in
a
climate
of
candor
,
and
made
a
genuine
attempt
to
get
information
and
understanding
one
another
's
problems
.
This
atmosphere
of
understanding
has
been
particularly
noticeable
where
relations
are
concerned
between
the
``
colonialist
''
powers
and
those
who
have
never
,
or
not
for
a
long_time
,
had
such
problems
.
The
nightmare
of
a
clash
between
those
in_trouble
in
Africa
,
exacerbated
by
the
difficulties
,
changes
,
and
tragedies
facing
them
,
and
other
allies
who
intellectually
and
emotionally
disapprove
of
the
circumstances
that
have
brought
these
troubles
about
,
has
been
conspicious
by
its
absence
.
In
the
case
of
Portugal
,
which
a_few
weeks
ago
was
rumored
ready_to
walk_out_of
the
NATO_Council
should
critics
of
its
Angola
policy
prove
harsh
,
there
has
been
a
noticeable
relaxation
of
tension
.
The
general
,
remarkably
courteous
,
explanation
has
left
basic
positions
unchanged
,
but
there
has
been
no
explosion
in
the
council
.
There
should
even
be
no_more
bitter
surprises
in
the
UN
General_Assembly
as
to
NATO
members
'
votes
,
since
a
new
ad_hoc
NATO
committee
has
been
set_up
so_that
in_the_future
such
topics
as
Angola
will
be
discussed
in_advance
.
Canada
alone
has
been
somewhat
out
of
step
with
the
Oslo
attempt
to
get
all
the
allied
cars
back
on
the
track
behind
the
NATO
locomotive
.
Even
Norway
,
despite
daily
but
limited
manifestations
against
atomic
arms
in
the
heart
of_this
northernmost
capital
of
the
alliance
,
is
today
closer
to
the
NATO
line
.
On_the_negative_side
of
the
balance_sheet
must
be
set
some
disappointment
that
the
United_States
leadership
has
not
been
as
much
in_evidence
as
hoped_for
.
One
diplomat
described
the
tenor
of
Secretary_of_State
Dean_Rusk
's
speeches
as
``
inconclusive
''
.
But
he
hastened
to
add
that
,
if
United_States
policies
were
not
always
clear
,
despite
Mr._Rusk
's
analysis
of
the
various
global
danger
points
and
setbacks
for
the
West
,
this
may
merely
mean
the
new
administration
has
not_yet
firmly
fixed
its
policy
.
A
certain
vagueness
may
also
be
caused
by
tactical
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
the
present
council
meeting
is
a
semipublic
affair
,
with
no_fewer_than
six
Soviet
correspondents
accredited
.
The
impression
has
nevertheless
been
given
during
these
three
days
,
despite
Mr._Rusk
's
personal
popularity
,
that
the
United_States
delegation
came
to
Oslo
in
a
somewhat
tentative
and
exploratory
frame_of_mind
,
more
ready_to
listen
and
learn
than
to
enunciate
firm
policy
on
a
global
scale
with
detailed
application
to
individual
danger
spots
.
The
Secretary_of_State
himself
,
in
his
first
speech
,
gave
some
idea
of
the
tremendous
march
of
events
inside
and
outside
the
United_States
that
has
preoccupied
the
new
administration
in_the_past
four
months
.
But
where
the
core
of
NATO
is
concerned
,
the
Secretary_of_State
has
not_only
reiterated
the
United_States
'
profound
attachment
to
the
alliance
,
``
cornerstone
''
of
its
foreign_policy
,
but
has
announced
that
five
nuclear
submarines
will
eventually
be
at
NATO
's
disposal
in
European
waters
.
The
Secretary_of_State
has
also
solemnly
repeated
a
warning
to
the
Soviet_Union
that
the
United_States
will
not
stand_for
another
setback
in
Berlin
,
an
affirmation
once_again
taken_up
by
the
council
as_a_whole
.
The
secretary
's
greatest
achievement
is
perhaps
the
rekindling
of
NATO
realization
that
East-West
friction
,
wherever
it
take_place
around
the
globe
,
is
in_essence
the
general
conflict
between
two
entirely
different
societies
,
and
must
be
treated
as_such
without
regard_to
geographical
distance
or
lack
of
apparent
connection
.
The
annual
spring
meeting
has
given
an
impetus
in
three
main
directions
:
more
,
deeper
,
and
more
timely
political
consultation
within
the
alliance
,
the
use
of
the
Organization
for
Economic_Cooperation
and
Development
(
when
ratified
)
as
a
method
of
coordinating
aid
to
the
underdeveloped
countries
,
and
the
need
for
strengthening
conventional
forces
as_well
as
the
maintenance
of
the
nuclear
deterrent
.
This
increase
in
the
``
threshold
''
,
as
the
conventional
forces
strengthening
is
called
,
will
prove
one
of
the
alliance
's
most
difficult
problems
in
the
months
to
come
.
Each
ally
will
have
to
carry_out
obligations
long_since
laid_down
,
but
never
completely
fulfilled
.
The
Kennedy
administration
moves
haltingly
toward
a
Geneva
conference
on
Laos
just_as
serious
debate
over
its
foreign_policy
erupts
for_the_first_time
.
There
is
little
optimism
here
that
the
Communists
will
be
any_more
docile
at
the
conference_table
than
they
were
in
military_actions
on_the_ground
in
Laos
.
The
United_States
,
State_Department
officials
explain
,
now
is
mainly
interested
in
setting_up
an
international
inspection
system
which
will
prevent
Laos
from
being
used
as
a
base
for
Communist
attacks
on
neighboring
Thailand
and
South
Viet_Nam
.
They
count_on
the
aid
of
the
neutral
countries
attending
the
Geneva
conference
to
achieve
this
.
The
United_States
hopes
that
any
future
Lao_Cabinet
would
not
become
Communist
dominated
.
But
it
is
apparent
that
no
acceptable
formula
has
been
found
to
prevent
such
a
possibility
.
The
inclination
here
is
to
accept
a
de_facto
cease-fire
in
Laos
,
rather_than
continue
to
insist
on
a
verification
of
the
cease-fire
by
the
international
control
commission
before
participating
in
the
Geneva
conference
.
This
is
another
of
the
modifications
of
policy
on
Laos
that
the
Kennedy
administration
has
felt
compelled
to
make
.
It
excuses
these
actions
as
being
the
chain_reaction
to
basic
errors
made
in
the
previous
administration
.
Its
spokesmen
insist
that
there
has
not
been
time
enough
to
institute
reforms
in
military
and
economic
aid
policies
in
the
critical
areas
.
But
with
the
months
moving_on
-
and
the
immediate
confrontations
with
the
Communists
showing
no
gain
for
the
free_world
-
the
question
arises
:
How
effective
have
Kennedy
administration
first
foreign_policy
decisions
been
in
dealing
with
Communist
aggression
?
Former
Vice-President_Richard_M._Nixon
in
Detroit
called_for
a
firmer
and
tougher
policy
toward
the
Soviet_Union
.
He
was
critical
of_what
he
feels
is
President_Kennedy
's
tendency
to
be
too
conciliatory
.
It
does
not
take
a
Gallup
poll
to
find_out
that
most
Republicans
in
Congress
feel
this
understates
the
situation
as
Republicans
see
it
.
They
can
hardly
restrain
themselves
from
raising
the
question
of
whether
Republicans
,
if
they
had
been
in
power
,
would
have
made
``
amateurish
and
monumental
blunders
''
in
Cuba
.
One
Republican
senator
told
this
correspondent
that
he
was
constantly
being
asked
why
he
did
n't
attack
the
Kennedy
administration
on
this
score
.
His
reply
,
he
said
,
was
that
he
agreed
to
the
need
for
unity
in
the
country
now
.
But
he
further
said
that
it
was
better
politics
to
let
others
question
the
wisdom
of
administration
policies
first
.
The
Republicans
some
weeks
ago
served
notice
through
Senator_Thruston_B._Morton
(
R
)
of
Kentucky
,
chairman
of
the
Republican_National_Committee
,
that
the
Kennedy
administration
would
be
held
responsible
if
the
outcome
in
Laos
was
a
coalition
government
susceptible
of
Communist
domination
.
Kennedy
administration
policies
also
have
been
assailed
now
from
another
direction
by
70
Harvard
,
Boston_University
,
Brandeis
,
and
Massachusetts_Institute
of
Technology
educators
.
This
group
pleads
with
the
administration
to
``
give
no
further
support
for
the
invasion
of
Cuba
by
exile
groups
''
.
It
recommends
that
the
United_States
``
seek
instead
to
detach
the
Castro
regime
from
the
Communist
bloc
by
working
for
a
diplomatic
detente
and
a
resumption
of
trade
relations
;
and
concentrate
its
constructive
efforts
on
eliminating
in
other
parts
of
Latin_America
the
social
conditions
on_which
totalitarian
nationalism
feeds
''
.
Mr._Nixon
,
for
his
part
,
would
oppose
intervention
in
Cuba
without
specific
provocation
.
But
he
did
recommend
that
President_Kennedy
state
clearly
that
if
Communist
countries
shipped
any
further
arms
to
Cuba
that
it
would
not
be
tolerated
.
Until
the
Cuban
fiasco
and
the
Communist
military
victories
in
Laos
,
almost
any
observer
would
have
said
that
President_Kennedy
had
blended
a
program
that
respected
,
generally
,
the
opinions
voiced
both
by
Mr._Nixon
and
the
professors
.
Very
early
in
his
administration
he
informed
the
Kremlin
through
diplomatic
channels
,
a
high
official
source
disclosed
,
that
the
new
administration
would
react
even
tougher
than
the
Eisenhower
administration
would
during
the
formative
period
of
the
administration
.
Strenuous
efforts
were
made
to
remove
pin
pricking
from
administration
statements
.
Policies
on
nuclear
test
ban
negotiations
were
reviewed
and
changed
.
But
thus_far
there
has
been
no
response
in_kind
.
Foreign
aid
programs
were
revamped
to
give
greater
emphasis
to
economic
aid
and
to
encourage
political
reform
in
recipient
nations
.
In
Laos
,
the
administration
looked_at
the
Eisenhower
administration
efforts
to
show
determination
by
sailing
a
naval
fleet
into
Southeast
Asian
waters
as
a
useless
gesture
.
Again_and_again
it
asked
the
Communists
to
``
freeze
''
the
military
situation
in
Laos
.
But
the
Communists
aided
the
Pathet_Lao
at
an
even
faster
rate
.
And
after
several
correspondents
went_into
Pathet_Lao
territory
and
exposed
the
huge
build-up
,
administration
spokesmen
acclaimed
them
for
performing
a
``
great
service
''
and
laid
the_matter
before
the
Southeast_Asia_Treaty_Organization
.
SEATO
was
steamed
up
and
prepared
contingency
plans
for
coping_with
the
military
losses
in
Laos
.
But
the
Communists
never
gave
sufficient
provocation
at
any
one_time
for
the
United_States
to
want
to
risk
a
limited
or
an
all-out
war
over
Laos
.
(
Some
SEATO
nations
disagreed
,
however
.
)
There
was
the
further
complication
that
the
administration
had
very
early
concluded
that
Laos
was
ill_suited
to
be
an
ally
,
unlike
its
more
determined
neighbors
,
Thailand
and
South
Viet_Nam
.
The
administration
declared
itself
in
favor
of
a
neutralized
Laos
.
The
pro-Western
government
,
which
the
United_States
had
helped
in
a
revolt
against
the
Souvanna_Phouma
``
neutralist
''
government
,
never
did
appear
to
spark
much
fighting
spirit
in
the
Royal_Lao_Army
.
There
certainly
was
not_any
more
energy
displayed
after
it
was
clear
the
United_States
would
not
back
the
pro-Western
government
to_the_hilt
.
If
the
administration
ever
had
any
ideas
that
it
could
find
an
acceptable
alternative
to
Prince_Souvanna_Phouma
,
whom
it
felt
was
too
trusting
of
Communists
,
it
gradually
had
to
relinquish
them
.
One
factor
was
the
statement
of
Senator_J._W._Fulbright
(
D
)
of
Arkansas
,
chairman
of
the
Senate_Foreign
Relations
Committee
.
He
declared
on
March_25
that
the
United_States
had
erred
a
year
and
a
half
ago
by
``
encouraging
the
removal
''
of
Prince_Souvanna
.
The
White_House
is
taking
extraordinary
steps
to
check
the
rapid_growth
of
juvenile_delinquency
in
the
United_States
.
The
President
is
deeply
concerned
over
this
problem
and
its
effect
upon
the
``
vitality
of
the
nation
''
.
In
an
important
assertion
of
national
leadership
in_this
field
,
he
has
issued
an
executive
order
establishing
the
President
's
committee
on
Juvenile_Delinquency
and
Crime
,
to
be
supported
and
assisted
by
a
Citizens
Advisory_Council
of
recognized
authorities
on
juvenile
problems
.
The
President
asks
the
support
and
cooperation
of
Congress
in
his
efforts
through
the
enactment
of
legislation
to
provide
federal
grants
to
states
for
specified
efforts
in
combating
this
disturbing
crime
trend
.
The
President
has
also
called_upon
the
Attorney_General
,
the
Secretary
of
Health
,
Education
and
Welfare
,
and
the
Secretary
of
Labor
to
coordinate
their
efforts
``
in
the
development
of
a
program
of
federal
leadership
to
assist
states
and
local
communities
in
their
efforts
to
cope_with
the
problem
.
Simultaneously
the
President
announced
Thursday
the
appointment
of
David_L._Hackett
,
a
special
assistant
ot
the
Attorney_General
,
as
executive_director
of
the
new
Committee
on
Juvenile_Delinquency
and
Youth
Crime
.
His
sense
of
urgency
in_this
matter
stems
from
the
fact
that
court
cases
ond
juvenile
arrests
have
more_than
doubled
since
1948
,
each_year
showing
an
increase
in
offenders
.
Among
arrests
reported
by
the
Federal_Bureau
of
Investigation
in
1959
,
about
half
for
burglary
and
larceny
involved
persons
under
18
years
of_age
.
