How
long
has
it
been
since
you
reviewed
the
objectives
of
your
benefit
and
service
program
?
Have
you
permitted
it
to
become
a
giveaway
program
rather
than
one
that
has
the
goal
of
improved
employee
morale
and
,
consequently
,
increased
productivity
?
What
effort
do
you
make
to
assess
results
of
your
program
?
Do
you
measure
its
relation_to
reduced
absenteeism
,
turnover
,
accidents
,
and
grievances
,
and
to
improved
quality
and
output
?
Have
you
set
specific
objectives
for
your
employee
publication
?
Is
it
reaching
these
goals
?
Is
it
larger
or
fancier
than
you
really
need
?
Are
you
using
the
most
economical
printing
methods
,
paper

.
Are
there
other
,
cheaper

that
could
be
substituted

Has
your
attitude
toward
employee
benefits
encouraged
an
excess
of

''
work
in
your
plant
?
Is
your
purchasing_agent
offering
too_much
free
buying
service
for
employees

When
improvements
are
recommended
in
working
conditions
-
such_as
lighting
,
rest_rooms
,
eating
facilities
,
air-conditioning
-
do
you
try
to
set
a
measure
of
their
effectiveness
on
productivity
?
When
negotiating
with
your
union
,
do
you
make
sure
employees
have
a
choice
between
new
benefits
and
their
cents
per
hour
cost
in
wages
.
Can
you
consider
restricting
any
additional
employee
benefits
to
those
paid
for
by
profit-sharing

,
such_as
was
done
in
the

Do
your
employees
understand
all
the
benefits
to
which
your
insurance
entitles
them
?
Are
they
encouraged
to
take
full
legal
advantage
of
these

Have
you
publicized
the
cents
per

the
company
's

maintain
the
principle

protect
your

have
an
uninterrupted

Are
you
carefully
policing
wash-up
time
and
rest
periods
to
be
certain
that
all
other

is
productive
?
Are
you

so
that
your

minimized
?
Have
you
considered
using
vending
equipment

replace
or
reduce
the
number
of
cafeteria

?
What
are
the
possibilities
for
operating
your

and
relying_upon
vending_machines

for
the
second

Can
staggered

Are
your

?
Could
an

Would
a

How
efficient
and
necessary
are
your
intra
company
vehicles
?
Can
they
be
re-scheduled
?
Can
part-time

be
assigned

Which
is
more
economical
for
your
plant
-
a
vacation
shutdown
or
spaced
vacations
that
require
extra
employees
for
vacation
fill-ins
?
Can
vacations
be
spaced
throughout
the
12
months
to
minimize
the
number
of
employee

?
Do
you
insist
that
unneeded
salary
employees
take
their
vacations
during
plant
shutdowns
?
What
can
your
sales
and
purchasing_departments
do
to
curtail
orders
,
shipments
,
and
receipts
during
vacation
shutdown
periods
?
Is
an
arbitrary
retirement
age
of
65
actually
costing
your
plant
money
?
What
sort
of
effort
do
you
make
to
assure
that
older
or
disabled
workers
are
fully
productive
?
Would
early
retirement
of
non-productive
,
disabled
employees
reduce
the
number
of
make-work
jobs
?
Will
your
union
accept
seniority
concessions
in
assigning
work
for
older
or
disabled
employees
?
Can
you
share
medical
facilities
and
staff
with
neighboring
plants
?
If
you
have
a
full-time
doctor
now
,
can
he
be
replaced
with
a
part-time
doctor
or
one
who
serves
on
a
fee
per
case
basis
only
?
Can
your
plant
nurse
be
replaced
by
a
trained
first-aid
man
who
works
full-time
on
some_other
assignment
?
Do
you
rigidly
distinguish
between
job
-
and
non
job
connected
health_problems
and
avoid
treating
the
latter
?
Are
you
indiscriminantly
offering
unnecessary
medical
services
-
flu
shots
,
sun
lamp
treatments
,
etc.
?
If
you
have
an
annual
or
regular
physical
examination
program
,
is
it
worth
what
it
is
costing
you
?
Consider
what
you
can
afford
to
spend
and
what
your
goals
are
before
setting_up
or
revamping
your
employee
benefit
program
.
Too
many
plant
officials
are
all_too
eager
to
buy
a
package
program
from
an
insurance_company
simply
because
it
works
for
another
plant
.
But
even
if
that
other
plant
employs
the
same
number
of
workers
and
makes
the
same
product
,
there
are
other
facts
to
consider
.
How
old
is
your
working
force
?
What
's
your
profit_margin
?
In
what
section
of
the
country
are
you
located
?
Are
you
in
a
rural
or
urban_area
?
These
factors
can
make
the
difference
between
waste
and
efficiency
in
any
benefit
program
.
Above_all
,
do
n't
set_up
extravagant
fringe_benefits
just
to
buy
employee
good_will
.
Unions
stress
fringe_benefits
,
but
the
individual
hourly
worker
prefers
cash
every
time
.
Aim
to
balance
your
employee
benefit
package
.
Some
plants
go
overboard
on
one
type
of
fringe
-
say
a
liberal
retirement
plan
-
and
find
themselves
vulnerable
elsewhere
.
They
're
asking_for
union
trouble
.
If
you
want
credit
for
your
employee
services
program
,
let
your
workers
know
what
they
're
entitled
to
.
Encourage
them
to
exercise
their
benefits
.
This
can
be
done
by
stories
in
your
house_organs
,
posters
,
special
publications
,
letters
to
workers
'
homes
as_well_as
by_word_of_mouth
through
your
chain
of
command
.
Some
companies
find
a
little
imagination
helpful
.
Hallmark_Cards_,_Inc.
,
Kansas_City
,
Mo.
,
has
a
do-it-yourself
quiz
game
called
``
Benefit_Bafflers
''
,
which
it
distributes
to
employees
.
M_+_R_Dietetic_Laboratories_,_Inc.
,
Columbus
,
gives
all
its
workers
a
facsimile
checkbook
-
each
check
showing
the
amount
the
company
spends
on
a
particular
fringe
.
U._S._Rubber_Company
,
New_York
,
passes
out
a
form
itemizing
the
value
of
benefits
.
The
blue-collar
worker
thus
knows
his
insurance
package
,
for_example
,
costs
$
227.72
.
Have
the
insurance_company
or
your
own
accounting
department
break_down
the
cost
of
your
insurance
package
periodically
.
You
may
find
certain
coverage
costing
much
more_than
is
economically
feasible
,
thereby
alerting
you
to
desirable
revisions
.
Check
to
see
if
some
of
your
benefits
-
such_as
on-the-job
disability
pay
-
can
be
put
on
a
direct
payment
rather
than
an
insured
basis
at
a
savings
to
you
.
Use
deductable
insurance
wherever
feasible
.
It
can
put
an
end
to
marginal
claims
which
play
havoc
with
your
insurance
rates
.
Also
,
beware
of
open_end
policies
,
especially
in
the
medical
field
.
This
will
mean
that
every
time
there
's
an
increase
in
hospital
rates
your
cost
will
go_up
in
like
manner
.
Put
a
dollar
and
cents
limit
on
benefits
.
Do
n't
go
overboard
on
insurance
that
pays
benefits
only
upon
death
.
Generally
,
your
employee
will
greatly
appreciate
benefits
that
protect
him
during
his
working
life
or
during
retirement
.
In
granting
bereavement
leaves
,
specify
the
maximum
time_off
and
list
what
the
worker
's
relation
to
the
deceased
must
be
to
qualify
.
Thus
,
you
avoid
headaches
when
an
employee
wants
off
for
his
fourth
cousin
's
funeral
.
Also
,
reserve
the
right
to
demand
proof
of
death
despite
the
fact
that
you
'll
probably
never
use
it
.
Coffee_breaks
can
be
a
real
headache
if
not
regulated
.
Vending_machines
can
alleviate
the
long
hike
to
the
cafeteria
during
the
break
with
resulting
waste
of
production
time
.
If
coffee
is
sold
at
the
cafeteria
,
let
a_few
workers
in
each
department
get
it
for
the
whole
group
.
Consider
installing
supplemental
serving
lines
in
production
areas
.
Make
sure
milk
for
the
coffee
is
placed
in
dispensers
rather
than
in
containers
,
if
you
are
supplying
the
coffee
.
Otherwise
,
you
may
be
saddled
with
a
good
size
milk
bill
by
milk
drinkers
.
Keep
the
retirement
age
flexible
so
skilled
craftsmen
such_as
tool
and
die
makers
can
be
kept
on_the_job
for
the
convenience
of
the
company
.
And
so
deadheads
on
the
payroll
can
be
eased
out
at
the
earliest
possible
age
.
Make
sure
you
have
minimum
age
and
time
on_the_job
requirements
tied
into
your
pension
plan
.
Younger
men
usually
do
n't
think_of
pensions
as
an
important
job
benefit
factor
anyhow
and
they
're
liable
to
change
jobs
several
times
before
settling_down
.
Choose
carefully
between
contributory
or
non
contributory
pension
plans
.
There
are
two
sides
of
a
coin
for
this
decision
.
Workers
usually
think
more
of
a
plan
they
contribute
to
.
And
they
can
at_least
collect
the
money
they
put_in
,
plus
interest
,
when
they
leave
the
company
.
A
non
contributory
plan
usually
won
n't
pay_off
for
the
worker
until
he
retires
.
Thus
,
there
is
an
added
incentive
to
stay
on_the_job
.
Make
sure
you
do
n't
pay
for
holidays
that
occur
when
an
employee
would
not
otherwise
be
working
.
These
include
:
leaves_of_absences
,
illnesses
,
and
layoffs
.
Consider
adopting
a
system
of
holidays
in
which
time_off
is
granted
with
an
eye
to
minimum
inconvenience
to
the
operation
of
the
plant
.
It
's
usually
not
too
hard
to
sell
workers
on
this
as
it
gives
them
longer
holiday
periods
.
For_example
,
the
Friday
after
Thanksgiving
can
be
substituted
for
Washington
's
birthday
.
This
reduces
the
number
of
expensive
plant
shutdowns
and
startups
.
Require
each
employee
to
work
his
last
shift
both
before
and
after
the
holiday
to
be
eligible
for
pay
.
This
cuts
the
absentee_rate
.
Consider
using
vending_machines
rather
than
subsidized
cafeterias
.
Latest
models
serve
hot
meals
at
reasonable
prices
,
and
at
a
profit
to
you
.
If
a
concessionaire
runs
the
cafeteria
,
keep
an
eye
out
for
quality
and
price
.
If
the
soup
tastes
like
dishwater
,
your
employees
won
n't
blame
the
concessionaire
.
You
'll
take
the
rap
.
Check
your
cafeteria
location
to
make
sure
it
's
convenient
for
most
employees
.
You
may
save
valuable
production
minutes
with
a
change
.
Spread
your
vacation
period
over
the
widest
possible
span
of
time
or
shut
the
plant
down
for
two_weeks
.
This
will
cut
the
expense
of
vacation
replacements
.
And
with
the
shutdown
method
there
will
be
no
argument
as
to
who
gets
the
choice
vacation
dates
.
Also
make
sure
you
have
reasonable
requirements
as
to
hours
worked
before
a
production
employee
is
entitled
to
a
vacation
.
You
might
try
providing
standard
vacation
time_off
but
make
the
vacation
pay
depend_on
the
number
of
hours
worked
in
the
previous
year
.
