I
would
like
to
add
one
more
practical
reform
to
those
mentioned
by
Russell_Kirk
[
Dec.
16
]
.
It
has
to
do
with
teachers
'
salaries
and
tenure
.
Next
September
,
after
receiving
a
degree
from
Yale
's
Master_of_Arts_in_Teaching
Program
,
I
will
be
teaching
somewhere
-
that_much
is
guaranteed
by
the
present
shortage
of
mathematics_teachers
.
I
will
also
be
underpaid
.
The
amazing
thing
is
that
this
too
is
caused
by
the
dearth
of
teachers
.
Teaching
is
at_present
a
sellers
'
market
;
as
a
result
buyers
,
the
public
,
must
be
satisfied
with
second-rate
teachers
.
But
this
is
not
the
real
problem
;
the
rub
arises
from
the
fact
that
teachers
are
usually
paid
on
the
basis
of
time
served
rather_than
quality
.
Hence
all
teachers
,
good
and
bad
,
who
have
been
teaching
for
a
given
number
of
years
are
paid
the
same
salary
.
I
am
firmly
convinced
that
considering
the
average
quality
of
teachers
in_this
country
,
the
profession
is
grossly
overpaid
.
It
follows
that
teachers
as_a_group
cannot
expect
any
marked
salary
increases
;
there
is
a
limit
to
how
much
the
public
will
pay
for
shoddy
performance
.
The
only
hope
which
good
teachers
have
for
being
paid
their
due
is
to
stop
dragging
the
dead
weight
of
poor
teachers
up
the
economic
ladder
with
them
.
The
only
hope
which
the
public
has
for
getting
good
teachers
is
to
pay
teachers
on
the
basis
of
merit
rather_than
tenure
.
Here
,
as
in_all
sectors
of
the
economy
,
quality
and
justice
are
both
dependent_on
the
right
of
the
individual
to
deal
directly
with
his
employer
if
he
so
chooses
.
On
the
eve
of
the
``
great
debate
''
on
the
proposal
to
give
the
President
broad
powers
to
make
across-the-board
tariff
concessions
which
could
practically
bring
us
into
the
Atlantic_Community
,
we
should
face
the
alternatives
on
this
proposition
.
What
we
will
be
sacrificing
in
any
such
arrangement
will
be
our
power
to
be
selective
which
is
contained
in
the
reciprocal
trade
principle
under
which
we
now
operate
.
Without
this
power
we
lay
open
any
American
industry
which
the
Europeans
may
find
it
economically
profitable
to
destroy
to
the
will
of
others
.
It
is
this
loss
of
initiative
in
how
we
conduct
our
economy
which
may
lead
to
the
loss
of
initiative
in
how
we
conduct
our
political
affairs
.
I
disagree
with
Mr._Burnham
's
position
on
the
Common_Market
[
Nov.
18
]
as
a
desirable
organization
for
us
to
join
.
For
him
to
ignore
the
political
consequences
involved
in
an
Atlantic_Union
of_this
kind
is
difficult
to
understand
.
The
pressure
for
our
entry
to
the
Common_Market
is
mounting
and
we
will
proceed
towards
this
amalgamated
trade_union
by
way
of
a
purely
``
economic
thoroughfare
''
,
or
garden
path
,
with
the
political
ramifications
kept
neatly
in
the
background
.
The
appeal
is
going_to
be
to
the
pocketbook
and
may
be
very
convincing
to
those
who
do
not
see
its
relation_to
political
and
legal
,
as_well
as
economic
,
self-rule
.
In
entering
this
union
we
will
be
surrendering
most
,
if_not
all
,
of
our
economic
autonomy
to
international
bodies
such_as
the
Atlantic_Institute
(
recently
set_up
)
or
the
O._E._C._D.
,
I._M._F.
and_others
.
To
think
that
we
can
merely
relinquish
our
economic
autonomy
without
giving_up
our
political
or
legal
autonomy
is
wishful_thinking
.
If
it
is
not
enough
that
all_of
our
internationalist
One
Worlders
are
advocating
that
we
join
this
market
,
I
refer
you
to
an
article
in
the
New_York
Times
'
magazine
section
[
Nov.
12
,
1961
]
,
by
Mr._Eric_Johnston
,
entitled
``
We
Must
Join
the
Common_Market
''
.
He
says
:
``
It
has
swept
aside
petty
nationalisms
,
age-old
rivalries
,
and
worn-out
customs
''
.
Referring
to
Britain
,
he
says
,
``
We
see
a
nation
that
traditionally
values
sovereignty
above_all
else
willing
to
give_up
its
economy
,
placing
this
authority
in
Continental
hands
''
.
Since
the
goal
of
our
international
planners
is
a
World_Government
,
this
Atlantic_Community
would
mark
a
giant
step
in
that
direction
for
,
once
American
economic
autonomy
is
absorbed
,
a
larger
grouping
is
a
question
of
time
.
Frankly
,
it
is
being
very
cleverly
done
for
,
in_a_sense
,
they
have
us
over
a
barrel
.
Listen
to
what
Mr._Johnston
has
to
say
:
``
Consider
the
savage
wounds
that
isolationism
would
inflict
.
We
would
lose
our
export
markets
and
deny
ourselves
the
imports
we
need
.
We
would
be
crippled
by
reduced
output
,
industrial
decline
,
widespread
unemployment
''
.
But
the
solution
to
this
dilemma
is
not
the
incorporation
of
the
United_States
into
an
Atlantic_Community
or
``
economic
empire
''
,
but
merely
what
libertarians
like
Henry_Hazlitt
and
Ludwig_von_Mises
have
been
arguing
for
years
:
an
end
to
government
regulations
,
an
end
to
government
competition
in
industry
,
and
a
realistic
depreciation_allowance
for
industry
.
Create
a
free
market
here
,
give
us
a
sound
,
debt-free
money
system
,
and
we
'll
compete
with
anyone
,
Europe
and
Asia
combined
.
In_short
,
get
this
governmental
monstrosity
off
our
backs
and
we
won
n't
have
to
worry
about
European
competition
or
Communism
either
.
If
we
want
to
preserve
our
sovereignty
,
this
is
the
way
to
do
it
;
not
acquiesce
to
an
international
planning_board
.
If
we
go_into
this
Common_Market
,
we
might
just_as
well
stop
talking_about
Constitutional
guarantees
,
Connally
Amendments
or
,
for_that_matter
,
conservatism
in_general
.
We
welcome
this
able
brief
for
the
negative
as
part
of
a
many-sided
discussion
of
the
Atlantic
Common_Market
which
NR
will
be
continuing
in
our
pages

The
Peiping
Chinese
were
the
only
major
silver
seller
in
the
world
markets
who
stopped
selling
the
metal
on
Monday
morning
,
November
27
,
anticipating
by
two
days
the
announcement
of
the
U._S._Treasury
that
the
pegged
offering
price
will
be
removed
.
In
1954
I
was
drafted
and
after
serving
two
years
honorably
on
Active
Duty
I
was
not
required
to
participate
in
any
further
Army_Reserve
activities
.
Now
,
more_than
five
years
later
,
I
cannot
in
any
realistic
sense
be
called
a
trained
soldier
.
But
,
in_spite_of
this
,
I
,
at_present
a
man
31
years
of_age
and
a
College_Professor
,
have
been
recalled
``
by
direction
of
the
President
''
to
report
on
November
25
th
to
Fort_Devens
,
Massachusetts
,
for
another
twelve
months
of
Active
Duty
as
an
Sp
4
(
the
equivalent
of
a
PFC
)
.
Today
,
seven
years
after
the
date
of
my
initial
induction
as
a
draftee
,
I
am
Assistant_Professor
of
Philosophy
and
Science
at
St._Michael
's
College
.
For
,
after
leaving
the
Army
in
1956
,
I
spent
five
years
in
Graduate_School
first
at
Boston_College
and_then
at
the
University
of
Toronto
.
This
time
,
added_to
that
which
I
had
already
spent
in
school
prior
to
my
induction
in
1954
,
makes
a
total
of
twenty-two
(
22
)
years
of
education
.
The
possibility
of
recall
into
the
Army
is
part
of
the
price
that
a
modern
American
has
to
pay
for
the
enviable
heritage
of
liberty
which
he
enjoys
.
With
this
no
loyal
citizen
can
quarrel
.
However
,
it
seems
axiomatic
that
the
government
has
an
obligation
``
to
exercise
its
mandate
reasonably
,
equitably
and
with
full
regard
for
the
disruptions
which
it
inevitably
causes
''
.
In
my
own
case
,
I
submit
that
such
reasonable
and
fair
exercise
is
woefully
lacking
.
Taken_back
into
the
Army
now
as
an
Sp
4
,
I
am
leaving
110
college_students
whose
teacher
I
am
.
(
A
wry
sidelight
on
this
is
that
most_of
my
students
have
deferments
from
the
draft
in_order_to
attend
my
classes
.
)
At
this
late
date
,
it
is
impossible
for
St._Michael
's
College
to
find
a
suitable
replacement
for
me
.
Even
apart
from
the
fact
that
now
at
the
age
of
31
my
personal
life
is
being
totally
disrupted
for
the
second
time
for
no
very
compelling
reason
-
I
cannot
help
looking_around
at
the
black
leather
jacket
brigades
standing
idly
on
the
street_corners
and
in
the
taverns
of
every
American
city
and
asking
myself
if
our
society
has
gone
mad
.
In
news
broadcasts
I
consistently
hear
the
foreign
volunteers
fighting
in
the
Katanga_Army
referred
to
as
mercenaries
.
This
confuses
me
no_end
.
If
the
Hessian
troops
sent
here
willy-nilly
by
the
Hessian
Government
to
fight
for
England
in
the
1770
's
were
mercenaries
,
what
shall
we
call
the
UN
troops
sent
to
the
Congo
willy-nilly
by
their
governments
to
fight
for
the
United_Nations
?
If
the
UN
troops
are
not
mercenaries
then
the
Hessians
were
not
mercenaries
either
.
And
if
the
foreigners
fighting
in
the
Katanga_Army
are
mercenaries
then
Lafayette
and
von_Steuben
were
mercenaries
too
,
as
were
also
the
members
of
the
Lafayette_Escadrille
in
the
early
part
of
World_War
1
,
and
of
Chennault
's
Flying_Tigers
in
the
early
days
of
World_War
2
,
.
It
does
n't
take
a
Gore_Vidal
to
tell
you
what
's
wrong
with
Cherokee_Textile
's
slogan
[
``
Pitney-Bowes
Objects
''
,
July_1
]
.
It
's
an
eighteenth-century
negative
,
man
!
Suggest
the
following
twenty-first-century
amendment
:
By
moving
the
term
``
Republic
''
to
lower_case
,
substituting
the
modern
phrase
``
move
ahead
''
for
the
stodgy
``
keep
''
,
and
by
using
the
Postmaster
's
name
on
every
envelope
(
in
caps
,
of_course
,
with
the
``
in
spite
''
as
faded
as
possible
)
,
the
slogan
cannot
fail
.
In
the
issue
of
March
5
,
1960
you
had
an
excellent
editorial
which
said
:
``
On
trial
in
Jakarta
for
having
flown
for
the
Indonesian
anti-Communist
insurgents
,
U._S.
pilot
Alan_Lawrence_Pope
boldly
told
the
court
that
in
supporting
the
freedom
fighters
,
he
was
actually
defending
the
sovereignty
and
independence
of
Indonesia
.
Facing
a
prosecution
which
has
demanded
the
death_penalty
,
he
said
:
'
I
have
participated
in
the
war
against
Communism
in
Korea
and
at
Dienbienphu
,
and
I
have
helped
in
the
evacuation
of
North
Vietnamese
to
the
free_world
.
I
have
done
all
this
for
the
freedom
of
the
individuals
concerned
and
also
for
the
states
which
have
been
threatened
by
Communist
domination
'
.
At_least
in
Indonesia
,
Khrushchev
found
an
American
proud
to
be
at
total
war
with
Communism
''
!
Since
then
nothing
has
happened
to
save
the
life
of
Pope
.
I
found
recently
a
very
small
article
in
the
New_York
Times
:
``
U._S.
Flier
loses
Plea
.
Indonesia_Court
Upholds
Pope
's
Death
Sentence
.
-
Indonesia_Military
Supreme_Court
has
confirmed
the
death
sentence
passed
on
Alan_Lawrence_Pope
,
an
American
pilot
.
Pope
was
convicted
last
year
of
having
aided
North
Celebes
rebels
by
flying
bombing
missions
.
He
has
been
in
prison
since
May
,
1958
,
when
his
aircraft
was
shot_down
over
Moluccas
.
He
may
appeal_to

for
clemency
''
.
As
we
see
,
Pope
may
appeal_to
President_Sukarno
,
Khrushchev
's
friend
,
for
clemency
.
This
possibility
is
anything
but
reassuring
.
The
Eleanor_Roosevelt
Tractor_Committee
acts
on
behalf
of
the
Cuban
freedom
fighters
.
But
who
will
act
now
and
immediately
to
save
the
life
of
Alan_Pope
?
Are
tractors
available
for
him
?
Does
anybody
think_of
saving
the
life
of
an
anti-Communist
American
pilot
?
A_few
days
before
I
saw
your
mention
of_what
Texas
Liberals
were
doing
to
promote
``
Louis_Capet
''
[
``
The
Week
''
,
June
3
]
,
another
analogy
had
occurred
to
me
.
Consider
this
table
:
Louis
14
,
-
FDR
.
``
With
no
strong
men
and
no
parliament
to
dispute
his
will
,
he
was
the
government
''
.
Regency
-
Truman
.
``
A
'
dust-settling
'
period
of
decadence
and
decline
''
.
Louis
15
,
-
Eisenhower
.
``
He
opened
his
mouth
,
said
little
,
and
thought
not_at_all
''
.
Louis
16
,
-
Kennedy
.
``
Not
completely
virtuous
,
but
completely
incompetent
''
.
And
Marie_Antoinette
-
Jacqueline_Bouvier
.
``
the
beautiful
and
light-hearted
''
.
French_Revolution
-
Conservative_Revolution
?
Truly
,
that
Liberals
should
choose
Louis
14
,
as
a
bogey-symbol
of
conservatism
is
grotesquely
ironic
,
considering
the
Louis
14
,
character
of
their
Grand
Monarque
,
FDR
:
not_only
in
his
accretion
of
absolute
power
and
personal
deification
,
(
le
roi
gouverne
par
lui
meme
)
,
but
in
the
disastrous
effects
of
his
spending
and
war
policies
.
In
defeating
``
Louis_Capet
''
,
John_Tower
's
victory
in
Texas
signals
,
once_again
,
the
end
of
the
divine
right
of
Liberalism
.
