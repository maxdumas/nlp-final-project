How
,
he
wondered
,
does
one
enjoy
one
's
spare_time
?
He
considered
some
interesting
excursion
but
he
was
on
the
road
every_day
from
dawn
to
dusk
.
Then
there
was
exercise
,
boating
and
hiking
,
which
was
not_only
good_for_you
but
also
made
you
more
virile
:
the
thought
of
strenuous
activity
left
him
exhausted
.
Perhaps
golf
,
with
a
fashionable
companion
-
but
he
'd
lost
his
clubs
,
had
n't
played
in
years
.
There
was
swimming
over
at
the
Riverside_Hotel
,
but
his
skin
was
so
white
he
looked_like
the
bottom
of
a
frog
.
Perhaps
a
packing
trip
into
the
Sierras
,
let
his
beard
grow
-
but
that
was
too
stark
.
I
could
,
he
thought
,
take
a
long
walk
-
but
where
?
The
telephone
rang
.
``
You
missed
it
''
,
Buzz
's
voice
said
,
``
You
should
have
gone
over
to
the
Pagan_Room
with
us
.
Wow
.
Strippers
,
but
scrumptious
,
and
Toodle_Williams
and
her
all-lesbian
band
''
.
``
Hi
,
Buzz
''
,
Owen
said
.
``
I
went
over
to
the
Willows
and
dropped
two
notes
''
.
``
Tough
''
,
Buzz
said
,
``
Listen
,
we
're
having
a
stag
dinner
over
at
the
Pagan_Room
on
Friday
.
Imagine
a
stag
dinner
with
Toodle_Williams
''
.
He
laughed
and
laughed
.
Owen
wanted
to
be
pleasant
because
Buzz
worked
the
territory
next
to
his
,
but
he
had
n't
come
to
Reno
for
stag
dinners
.
``
Thanks
''
,
Owen
said
,
``
but
Friday
is
a
long
way
off
and
anything
can
happen
''
.
Buzz
was
a
tireless
instigator
who
never
let
his
victims
rest
.
When
Owen
was
finally
rid
of
him
,
there
was
a
timid
rap
at
the
door
.
``
Yes
''
,
Owen
called_out
.
``
Yes
''
?
``
I
'm
Mrs._Gertrude_Parker
''
,
a
soft
voice
explained
,
``
And
I
'd
like
to
talk
to
you
for
a_few
minutes
,
please
''
.
Ahah
,
he
thought
,
a
lush
divorcee
at_last
.
Probably
saw
me
in
the
lobby
.
He
was
disappointed
to
find
a
nervous
,
scrawny
woman
with
a
big
hat
standing
at
the
door
.
She
frowned
at
his
green
pajamas
with
the
yellow
moons
.
``
How_do_you_do
''
?
she
said
,
semi-professionally
.
``
Our
church
is
sponsoring
a
group
of
very
courageous
women
up
in
Alaska
.
We
call
them
lay-sisters
and
they
go
among
the
Eskimos
making
friends
and
bringing
the
light
.
They
're
up
there
in_that
freezing
climate
and
all_of
us
have
to
try
and
help
them
''
.
``
Oh
''
?
``
You
see
''
,
she
said
,
looking
past
him
into
the
room
,
where
the
highball
glasses
sparkled
dully
in
the
bright
light
,
``
you
and
I
can
n't
understand
the
many
hardships
they
have
to
undergo
''
.
``
Why
is
that
''
?
She
apparently
was
n't
satisfied
with
his
reaction
.
Smug
,
Owen
thought
,
smug
and
sappy
.
There
was
a
slight
nervous
twitch
in
the
region
of
her
left
eye
.
It
gave
her
a
lewd
,
winking
effect
.
``
Have
you
ever
tried
to
reason
with
an
Eskimo
''
?
she
asked
,
winking
wildly
.
``
They
are
a
very
difficult
group
of
people
''
.
``
I
do
n't
know
much
about
them
''
,
Owen
admitted
,
``
but
I
suppose
they
have
their
own
religion
and
they
probably
resent
outsiders
coming_in
and
telling
them
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
''
.
She
smiled
in
a
sickly-tolerant
fashion
.
``
You
know
,
that
's
very
interesting
.
People
do
n't
know
how
much
they
give_away
about
themselves
by
remarks
like
that
.
The
more
canvassing
I
do
,
the
more
I
note
how
far
most
people
are
from
their
personal
God
''
.
Forebearing
,
Owen
kept
his
peace
.
What
would
happen
next
?
That
she
was
out
for
a
touch
was
certain
,
but
when
did
she
get_to
the
pitch
?
Several
people
passed
in
the
hall
and
stared
as
he
slowly
retreated
,
trying
to
close
the
door
a_little
,
and
she
slowly
leaned
toward
him
and
raised
her
voice
.
``
How
did
you
get_by
the
desk
''
?
he
asked
curiously
.
``
I
'm
sure
the
hotel
does
n't
know
you
're
wandering
around
the
corridors
,
knocking
on
strangers
'
doors
and
talking_down
Eskimos
''
.
``
Oh
,
I
just
come
once
a
week
.
Every_day
I
visit
a
different
hotel
.
I
feel
it
's
my
duty
.
I
do
this
work
all
on
my
own
,
because
I
understand
the
difficulties
and
I
want
to
help
these
lay-sisters
.
Do
you
know
these
women
go
all
through
Alaska
,
and
they
do
n't
have
the
proper
facilities
?
They
travel
in
pairs
as
much_as
a
hundred-and-fifty
miles
a
day
''
.
``
Do
you
have
any
idea
how
far
I
travel
every_day
?
I
have
the
whole
Pacific_Northwest
''
.
Owen
was
aware
he
was
getting
overexcited
but
he
could
n't
help
himself
.
Mrs.
gertrude
Parker
drew_back
.
``
That
's
hardly_a
Christian
approach
''
,
she
remonstrated
.
``
You
're
in
the
secular
world
''
.
``
I
did
n't
say
it
was
Christian
.
I
do
n't
think
you
'll
find
many
active
Christian
salesmen
.
Not
that
religion
is
n't
big
business
;
those
bibles
and
prayer_books
make
a_lot_of
money
for
publishing_houses
,
but
they
do
n't
get
top
personnel
.
Our
key
salesmen
are
in
appliances
and
cosmetics
''
.
``
God
,
I
take
it
,
plays
no
part
in_this
''
,
she
said
waspishly
.
``
God
does
n't
have
any
appliance
or
cosmetics
''
,
he
said
heatedly
before
he
caught
himself
.
It
sounded
silly
;
why
go_on
?
More
people
were
passing
;
he
had_to
find
some
way
to
close
this
impossible
conversation
.
``
And
whiskey
''
,
she
said
,
smiling
and
blinking
at
the
highball
glasses
.
``
Do
n't
forget
whiskey
;
it
's
such
a
big
seller
''
.
``
You
know
''
,
he
said
,
getting
a
grip
on
himself
,
``
I
think
you
're
going_to
have
to
excuse
me
.
I
have
an
appointment
''
.
``
I
can
imagine
''
,
she
said
.
``
Probably
down
at
the
bar
.
But
what
do
you
want
to
do
about
the
lay-sisters
?
They
must
be
freezing
up
there
now
.
Ca
n't
you
help
them
''
?
``
Leave
a
card
or
something
.
I
'll
think
it
over
''
.
``
I
have
no
card
''
,
she
said
bitterly
.
``
You
have
n't
been
listening
to
what
I
've
been
telling
you
.
I
only
hope
my
talking
to
you
has
helped
you
a_little
,
anyway
,
because
you
need
spiritual
bucking-up
''
.
She
looked
crestfallen
,
as
if
he
had
somehow
disappointed
the
whole
human_race
.
She
stood
indecisively
for
a
moment
,
then
walked
down
the
hall
;
he
heard
her
knocking
on
another
door
.
It
took
him
about
fifteen
minutes
to
calm
himself
;
then
he
realized
he
was
hungry
.
He
showered
,
shaved
,
dressed
and
went_down
to
the
dining_room
for
breakfast
.
On_the_way
he
stopped
at
the
desk
to
receive
his
mail
.
There
was
a
check
from
his
company
,
and
the
usual
enthusiastic
bulletins
on
new_lines
they
always
issued
.
His
lawyer
had
sent
him
a
statement
on
his
overdue
alimony
,
and
there
was
a
letter
from
the
Collector_of_Internal_Revenue
asking
him
to
stop
in
his
office
and
explain
last
year
's
exemptions
.
He
ate
breakfast
in
a
sullen
mood
,
but
afterwards
,
when
he
walked
out
onto
Virginia_Street
,
he
felt
braced
.
He
looked
off
to
the
crest
of
the
Sierras
,
still
white-topped
;
the
glisten
of
the
Truckee_River
made
a
wide
spangle
.
He
felt
suddenly
elated
,
adventurous
.
With
any
luck
at_all
he
could
easily
find
a
flowerpot
.
Although
it
was
only
three
o
'
clock
,
he
stopped
in
at
the
Golden_Calf
.
The
tables
were
all
spinning
,
the
dice
rattling
,
the
bar
crowded
.
Just
to
test
himself
,
he
played
roulette
for
quarters
on
his
old
combination
,
five
and
seventeen
,
and
within
an
hour
,
he
had
won
,
surprisingly
,
twenty
dollars
.
The
way
was
opening_up
;
when
the
management
brought
around
champagne
,
the
breakfast
settled
its
whirling_around
in
his
stomach
.
The
Golden_Calf
was
dimly
lit
with
shaded
neon
.
There
were
more
women
than
men
in
the
place
,
but
he
could
n't
find
a
flowerpot
.
They
all
had
the
hard
look
of
gamblers
who
had
stopped
dreaming
,
who
automatically
turned
the
cards
,
hardly
caring
what
showed_up
.
The
mural
around
the
wall
depicted
early
settlers
in
covered_wagons
,
who
appeared
much
more
animated
than
the
gamblers
.
The
women
had
a
bright
shining
expectancy
as
they
leaned
out
from
the
wall
and
gazed
splendidly
into
the
distance
,
while
the
men
were
stern
but
hopeful
.
All
,
of_course
,
except
the
Donner
party
who
were
bent_on
starving
to
death
.
``
I
wonder
if
they
did
eat
each
other
at
the
end
''
,
Owen
mused
.
He
sat_down
next
to
a
heavily-upholstered
blonde
,
but
she
was
cleaned_out
in
twenty
minutes
.
She
sighed
a
dirty
word
and
left
.
Owen
was
surprised
to
see
Mrs._Gertrude_Parker
playing
the
one-arm
bandits
that
were
cunningly
arranged
by
the
entrance
.
She
sat_down
and
played
two
slots
at_once
,
looking
grim
,
as
if
bested
by
mechanical_devices
,
and
Owen
felt
sorry_for
the
lay-sisters
depending_on
her
support
.
A
dried-up
cowboy
sat_down
next
to
him
in
the
blonde
's
place
.
He
was
a_little
more
authentic
than
usual
because
he
smelled
slightly
of
the
stables
.
``
What
you
need
is
a
steady
martingale
''
,
the
cowboy
announced
after
watching
Owen
play
.
``
You
can
n't
build_on
your
hit-and-miss
five-seventeen
''
.
``
What
are
you
playing
''
?
Owen
asked
.
``
I
'm
just
logging
''
,
the
cowboy
explained
.
``
I
keep
all
these
plays
in_this
little
black_book
,
and
I
watch
over
a
twelve-hour
period
to
find_out
what
numbers
are
repeating
.
But
roulette
's
not
my
game
.
I
'm
always
trying
to
find
a
breaking
table
in
blackjack
.
Incidentally
,
I
'm
pretty
famous
in
these
parts
:
I
'm
called
The
Wrangler
''
.
``
Nice
to
know
you
.
Do
n't
you
have
to
spend
any
time
on
your
ranch
''
?
``
Well
,
of_course
I
do
.
I
'm
with
the
Bar
-
H
,
pushing
a
horse
called
Sparky
.
He
's
my
own
horse
,
and
what
I
collect
from
him
I
use
on
blackjack
.
This
Sparky
can
rack
and
single-foot
and
he
's
the
fastest
thing
in
Washoe_County
.
I
figure
if
I
can
get
any
kind_of
publicity
campaign
going
,
I
'll
land
him
on
TV
-
you
know
,
one
of
those
favorite
horses
for
some
Western
hero
.
I
once
trained
a
horse
for
Hoot_Gibson
,
but
nothing
like
Sparky
.
He
's
a
pinto
and
he
photographs
wonderfully
''
.
Five
came_up
while
Owen
was
listening
to
The
Wrangler
and
he
neglected
to
play
,
a
loss
of
ten
dollars
.
This
proved
conclusively
that
The
Wrangler
was
a
jinx
,
so
he
walked
on
down
to
Hurrays
,
an
even
more
glorified
gambling_den
than
the
Golden_Calf
.
When
he
looked
in_the_back
,
Mrs._Gertrude_Parker
was
marking
keno
cards
.
His
adventurous
spirit
had
waned
;
he
studied
the
pistol
exhibition
that
Hurrays
featured
as
an
added
attraction
.
He
ogled
a
long
redhead
with
green
eyes
,
but
she
was
a
shill
with
her
money
in_front
of
her
.
He
had
no
great
prejudice
against
shills
;
it
just
seemed
such
a
dry_run
.
There
was
no
cash
around
;
everyone
was
flipping
silver_dollars
.
The
management
discreetly
withdrew
the
green
stuff
into
the
office
and
gave
the
customers
chips
or
checks
or
premium
points
.
He
read
a
special
announcement
whereby
Hurrays
would
feature
a
special
floorshow
at
three
a.
m.
starring
Adele
(
The
Body
)
Brenner
and
fourteen
glamorous
schoolgirls
.
He
wondered
if
he
might
bag
a
tourist
,
but
they
looked
frightened
of
him
.
He
passed
two
brides
,
both
wearing
orchids
,
and
they
made
him
feel
a_little
sad
.
Owen
found
Buzz
watching
chuck-a-luck
.
Buzz
had_on
a
Hawaiian
shirt
and
was
carrying
some
sun-tan
oil
and
dark_glasses
.
He
was
shorter
and
fatter
than
Owen
,
who
felt
good
standing
next
to
him
.
``
We
're
all
going
over
to
Lake_Tahoe
and
try
our
luck
at
Cal-Neva
''
,
Buzz
explained
,
still
instigating
.
``
We
ran_into
a
guy
at
the
Pagan_Room
who
guarantees
we
can
beat
the
wheel
.
He
started_out
as
a
stickman
,
then
became
a
pit
boss
until
the
Club
found
him
crossroading
.
He
was
knocking_down
checks
at
faro
''
.
``
I
'm
allergic
to
Tahoe
''
,
Owen
explained
.
``
Something
about
the
pollen
''
.
``
Well
,
okay
''
,
Buzz
said
.
``
We
'll
see
you
around
later
''
.
Owen
went
over
to
the
crap
table
and
the
dice
were
hot
,
but
he
could
n't
pyramid
with
any
consecutive
success
.
``
How
's
your
luck
,
honey
''
?
A
short
platinum
blonde
in
a
bursting
sun-suit
addressed
him
.
She
looked
well-fed
and
prosperous
,
but
he
did
n't
get
the
impression
he
was
being
propositioned
the
way
he
'd
been
hoping
.
``
I
have
n't
had
any
luck
since
I
was
a
baby
''
.
``
Stake
me
''
,
she
said
,
``
and
let
me
at
those
dice
.
I
'll
make
them
dance
the
tango
.
We
'll
get_it
in
a
hurry
and
get_it
out
''
.
``
Let
's
have
a
drink
and
discuss
a
merger
''
.
``
If
you
go
broke
''
,
she
said
,
smiling
up
at
him
,
``
I
'll
leave
you
''
.
``
Sounds
like
real
love
''
,
Owen
said
.
``
It
sort_of
brings
a
lump
to
my
throat
''
.
``
My
name
's
Gisele
''
,
the
blonde
said
after
she
ordered
a
Scotch
.
``
Named
after
the
ballet
.
My
mother
wanted
to
call
me
Sylphide
,
but
it
sounded
too
affected
''
.
