There
was
one
fact
which
Rector
could
not
overlook
,
one
truth
which
he
could
not
deny
.
As_long_as
there
were
two
human_beings
working
together
on
the
same
project
,
there
would
be
competition
and
you
could
no_more
escape
it
than
you
could
expect
to
escape
the
grave
.
No_matter
how
devoted
a
man
was
,
no_matter
how
fully
he
gave
his
life
to
the
Lord
,
he
could
never
extinguish
that
one
spark
of
pride
that
gave
him
definition
as
an
individual
.
All_of
the
jobs
in
the
mission
might
be
equal
in
the
eyes
of
the
Lord
,
but
they
were
certainly
not
equal
in
the
eyes
of
the
Lord
's
servants
.
It
was
only
natural
that
Fletcher
would
strive
for
a
position
in
which
he
could
make
the
decisions
.
Even
Rector
himself
was
prey
to
this
spirit
of
competition
and
he
knew
it
,
not
for
a
more
exalted
office
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
church
-
his
ambitions
for
the
bishopry
had
died
very
early
in
his
career
-
but
for
the
one
clear
victory
he
had
talked_about
to
the
colonel
.
He
was
not
sure
how
much
of
this
desire
was_due
to
his
devotion
to
the
church
and
how
much
was
his
own
ego
,
demanding
to
be
satisfied
,
for
the
two
were
intertwined
and
could
not
be
separated
.
He
wanted
desperately
to
see
Kayabashi
defeated
,
the
Communists
in
the
village
rooted_out
,
the
mission
standing
triumphant
,
for
in
the
triumph
of
the
Lord
he
himself
would
be
triumphant
,
too
.
But
perhaps
this
was
a
part
of
the
eternal
plan
,
that
man
's
ambition
when
linked
with
God
would
be
a
driving
,
indefatigable
force
for
good
in
the
world
.
He
sighed
.
How
foolish
it
was
to
try
to
fathom
the
truth
in
an
area
where
only
faith
would
suffice
.
He
would
have_to
work
without
questioning
the
motives
which
made
him
work
and
content
himself
with
the
thought
that
the
eventual
victory
,
however
it
was
brought_about
,
would
be
sweet
indeed
.
His
first
move
was
to
send
Hino
to
the
village
to
spend
a_few
days
.
His
arm
had
been
giving
him
some
trouble
and
Rector
was
not
enough
of
a
medical
expert
to
determine
whether
it
had
healed
improperly
or
whether
Hino
was
simply
rebelling
against
the
tedious
work
in
the
print_shop
,
using
the
stiffness
in
his
arm
as
an
excuse
.
In_any_event
Rector
sent
him
to
the
local
hospital
to
have
it
checked
,
telling
him
to
keep_his_ears_open
while
he
was
in
the
village
to
see
if
he
could
find_out
what
Kayabashi
was
planning
.
Hino
was
elated
at
the
prospect
.
He
was
allowed
to
spend
his
nights
at
an
inn
near
the
hospital
and
he
was
given
some
extra
money
to
go_to
the
pachinko
parlor
-
an
excellent
place
to
make
contact
with
the
enemy
.
He
left
with
all
the
joyous
spirit
of
a
child
going
on
a
holiday
,
nodding
attentively
as
Rector
gave
him
his
final
instructions
.
He
was
to
get
involved
in
no
arguments
;
he
was
to
try
to
make
no
converts
;
he
was
simply
to
listen
and
report
back
what
he
heard
.
It
was
a
ridiculous
situation
and
Rector
knew
it
,
for
Hino
,
frankly
partisan
,
openly
gregarious
,
would
make
a
poor
espionage_agent
.
If
he
wanted
to
know
anything
,
he
would
end_up
asking
about
it
point-blank
,
but
in
this
guileless
manner
he
would
probably
receive
more
truthful
answers
than
if
he
tried
to
get
them
by
indirection
.
In
all
of
his
experience
in
the
mission
field
Rector
had
never
seen
a
convert
quite
like
Hino
.
From
the
moment
that
Hino
had
first
walked
into
the
mission
to
ask
for
a
job
,
any
job
-
his
qualifications
neatly
written
on
a
piece_of_paper
in
a
precise
hand
-
he
had
been
ready
to
become
a
Christian
.
He
had
already
been
studying
the
Bible
;
he
knew
the
fundamentals
,
and
after
studying
with
Fletcher
for
a
time
he
approached
Rector
,
announced
that
he
wanted
to
be
baptized
and
that
was
that
.
Rector
had
never
been
able
to
find_out
much
about
Hino
's
past
.
Hino
talked
very
little
about
himself
except
for
the
infrequent
times
when
he
used
a
personal
illustration
in
connection
with
another
subject
.
Putting
the
pieces
of
this
mosaic
together
,
Rector
had
the
vague
outlines
of
a
biography
.
Hino
was
the
fourth
son
of
an
elderly
farmer
who
lived
on
the
coast
,
in
Chiba
,
and
divided
his
life
between
the
land
and
the
sea
,
supplementing
the
marginal
livelihood
on
his
small
rented
farm
with
seasonal
employment
on
a
fishing_boat
.
Without
exception
Hino
's
brothers
turned_to
either
one
or
both
of
their
father
's
occupations
,
but
Hino
showed
a
talent
for
neither
and
instead
spent
most
of
his
time
on
the
beach
where
he
repaired
nets
and
proved
immensely
popular
as
a
storyteller
.
He
had
gone_into
the
Japanese
navy
,
had
been
trained
as
an
officer
,
had
participated
in
one
or
two
battles
-
he
never
went
into
detail
regarding
his
military
experience
-
and
at
the
age
of
twenty-five
,
quite
as
a
bolt
out_of_the_blue
,
he
had
walked
into
the
mission
as
if
he
belonged
here
and
had
become
a
Christian
.
Rector
was
often
curious
;
often
tempted
to
ask
questions
but
he
never
did
.
If
and
when
Hino
decided
to
tell
him
about
his
experiences
,
he
would
do
so
unasked
.
Rector
had
no
doubt
that
Hino
would
come_back
from
the
village
bursting
with
information
,
ready
to
impart
it
with
his
customary
gusto
,
liberally
embellished
with
his
active
imagnation
.
When
the
telephone
rang
on
the
day
after
Hino
went
down
to
the
village
,
Rector
had
a
hunch
it
would
be
Hino
with
some
morsel
of
information
too
important
to
wait
until
his
return
,
for
there
were
few
telephones
in
the
village
and
the
phone
in
Rector
's
office
rarely
rang
unless
it
was
important
.
He
was
surprised
to
find
Kayabashi
's
secretary
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
.
He
was
even
more
startled
when
he
heard
what
Kayabashi
wanted
.
The
oyabun
was
entertaining
a
group
of
dignitaries
,
the
secretary
said
,
businessmen
from
Tokyo
for_the_most_part
,
and
Kayabashi
wished
to
show
them
the
mission
.
They
had
never
seen
one
before
and
had
expressed
a
curiosity
about
it
.
``
Oh
''
?
Rector
said
.
``
I
guess
it
will
be
all_right
.
When
would
the
oyabun
like
to
bring
his
guests
up_here
''
?
``
This
afternoon
''
,
the
secretary
said
.
``
At
three
o'clock
if
it
will
be
of
convenience
to
you
at
that
time
''
.
``
All_right
''
,
Rector
said
.
``
I
will
be
expecting
them
''
.
He
was
about_to
hang_up
the
phone
,
but
a
note
of
hesitancy
in
the
secretary
's
voice
left
the
conversation
open
.
He
had
something
more
to
say
.
``
I
beg
to
inquire
if
the
back
is
now
safe
for
travelers
''
,
he
said
.
Rector
laughed
despite
himself
.
``
Unless
the
oyabun
has
been
working_on
it
''
,
he
said
,
then
checked
himself
and
added
:
``
You
can
tell
Kayabashi-san
that
the
back
road
is
in
very
good_condition
and
will
be
quite
safe
for
his
party
to
use
''
.
``
Arigato
gosaimasu
''
.
The
secretary
sighed
with
relief
and_then
the
telephone
clicked
in
Rector
's
hand
.
Rector
had
no
idea
why
Kayabashi
wanted
to
visit
the
mission
.
For
the
oyabun
to
make
such
a
trip
was
either
a
sign
of
great
weakness
or
an
indication
of
equally
great
confidence
,
and
from
all
the
available
information
it
was
probably
the
latter
.
Kayabashi
must
feel
fairly
certain
of
his
victory
in_order
to
make
a
visit
like
this
,
a
trip
which
could
be
so
easily
misinterpreted
by
the
people
in
the
village
.
At_the_same_time
,
it
was
unlikely
that
any
businessmen
would
spend
a
day
in
a
Christian
mission
out_of
mere
curiosity
.
No
,
Kayabashi
was
bringing
his
associates
here
for
a
specific
purpose
and
Rector
would
not
be
able
to
fathom
it
until
they
arrived
.
When
he
had
given
the
call
a_few
moments
thought
,
he
went_into
the
kitchen
to
ask
Mrs._Yamata
to
prepare
tea
and
sushi
for
the
visitors
,
using
the
formal
English
china
and
the
silver
tea_service
which
had
been
donated
to
the
mission
,
then
he
went
outside
to
inspect
the
grounds
.
Fujimoto
had
a
pile
of
cuttings
near
one
side
of
the
lawn
.
Rector
asked
him
to
move
it
for_the_time_being
;
he
wanted
the
mission
compound
to
be
effortlessly
spotless
.
A
good
initial
impression
would
be
important
now
.
He
went_into
the
print_shop
,
where
Fletcher
had
just
finished
cleaning
the
press
.
``
How
many
pamphlets
do
we
have
in_stock
''
?
Rector
said
.
``
I
should
say
about
a_hundred_thousand
''
,
Fletcher
said
.
``
Why
''
?
``
I
would
like
to
enact
a
little
tableau
this
afternoon
''
,
Rector
said
,
He
explained
about
the
visit
and
the
effect
he
wished
to
create
,
the
picture
of
a
very
busy
mission
.
He
did
not
wish
to
deceive
Kayabashi
exactly
,
just
to
display
the
mission
activities
in
a
graphic
and
impressive
manner
.
Fletcher
nodded
as
he
listened
to
the
instructions
and
said
he
would
arrange
the
things
Rector
requested
.
Rector
's
next
stop
was
at
the
schoolroom
,
where
Mavis
was
monitoring
a
test
.
He
beckoned
to
her
from
the
door
and
she
slipped
quietly
outside
.
He
told
her
of
the
visitors
and_then
of
his
plans
.
``
How
many
children
do
you
have
present
today
''
?
he
said
.
She
looked_back
toward
the
schoolroom
.
``
Fifteen
''
,
she
said
.
``
No
,
only
fourteen
.
The
little
Ito
girl
had_to
go_home
.
She
has
a
pretty
bad
cold
''
.
``
I
would
like
them
to
appear
very
busy
today
,
not
busy
exactly
,
but
joyous
,
exuberant
,
full_of_life
.
I
want
to
create
the
impression
of
a
compound
full
of
children
.
Do
you
think
you
can
manage
it
''
?
Mavis
smiled
.
``
I
'll
try
''
.
As
Rector
was
walking
back
toward
the
residential
hall
,
Johnson
came_out
of
the
basement
and
bounded
up_to
him
.
The
altercation
in
the
coffee_house
had
done
little
to
dampen
his
spirits
,
but
he
was
still
a_little
wary
around
Rector
for
they
had
not_yet
discussed
the
incident
.
``
I
think
I
've
fixed
the
pump
so
we
won't
have_to
worry
about
it
for
a
long_time
''
,
he
said
.
``
I
've
adjusted
the
gauge
so
that
the
pump
cuts_out
before
the
water
gets
too
low
''
.
``
Fine
''
,
Rector
said
.
He
looked
out
over
the
expanse
of
the
compound
.
It
was
going_to
take
a_lot
of
activity
to
fill
it
.
``
Have
you
ever
operated
a
transit
''
?
he
said
.
``
No
,
sir
''
,
Johnson
said
.
``
You
are
about_to
become
a
first-class
surveyor
''
,
Rector
said
.
``
When
Konishi
gets_back
with
the
jeep
,
I
want
you
to
round_up
two
or
three
Japanese
boys
.
Konishi
can
help
you
.
You
'll
find
an
old
transit
in
the
basement
.
The
glass
is
out_of
it
,
but
that
won't
matter
.
It
looks
pretty
efficient
and
that
's
the
important
thing
''
.
He
went_on
to
explain
what
he
had_in_mind
.
Johnson
nodded
.
He
said
he
could
do
it
.
Rector
was
warming_to
his
over-all
strategy
by
the
time
he
got_back
to
the
residential
hall
.
It
was
rather
a
childish
game
,
all_in_all
,
but
everybody
seemed
to
be
getting_into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
and
he
could
not
remember
when
he
had
enjoyed
planning
anything
quite
so
much
.
He
was
not
sure
what
effect
it
would
have
,
but
that
was
really
beside
the
point
when
you
got
right
down
to_it
.
He
was
not
going_to
lose
the
mission
by
default
,
and
whatever
reason
Kayabashi
had
for
bringing
his
little
sight-seeing
group
to
the
mission
,
he
was
going_to
be
in_for
a
surprise
.
He
found
Elizabeth
in
the
parlor
and
asked
her
to
make
sure
everything
was
in_order
in
the
residential
hall
,
and_then
to
take_charge
of
the
office
while
the
party
was
here
.
When
everything
had
been
done
,
Rector
went_back
to
his
desk
to
occupy
himself
with
his
monthly
report
until
three
o'clock
.
At
two
thirty
he
sent
Fujimoto
to
the
top
of
the
wall
at
the
northeast
corner
of
the
mission
to
keep_an_eye_on
the
ridge
road
and
give
a
signal
when
he
first
glimpsed
the
approach
of
Kayabashi
's
party
.
Then
Rector
,
attired
in
his
best
blue
serge
suit
,
sat
in
a
chair
out
on
the
lawn
,
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
,
smoking
a
cigarette
and
waiting
.
The
air
was
cooler
here
,
and
the
lacy
pattern
of
the
trees
threw
a
dappled
shadow
on
the
grass
,
an
effect
which
he
found
pleasant
.
