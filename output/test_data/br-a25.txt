Vast
spraying
programs
conducted
by
``
technicians
with
narrow
training
and
little
wisdom
''
are
endangering
crops
and
wildlife
,
Carl_W._Buchheister
,
president
of
the
National_Audubon_Society
,
said
today
.
``
It
is
like
handing
a
loaded
.45
automatic
to
an
8
-
year-old
and
telling
him
to
run
out
and
play
''
,
he
commented
.
Buchheister
told
delegates
to
the
West_Coast_Audubon_Convention
that
aerial
spraying
in
Louisiana
failed
to
destroy
its
target
,
the
fire_ant
.
``
But
it
did
destroy
the
natural
controls
of
a
borer
and
released
a
new
plague
that
wrecked
a
sugar_cane
crop
''
,
he
said
.
The
conservation
leader
said
other
mistakes
in
spraying
had
caused
serious
damage
in
Ohio
and
Wyoming
.
There
have
even
been
serious
errors
in
the
U._S._Forest_Service
,
whose
officials
pride
themselves
in
their
scientific
training
,
he
added
.
``
The
news
of
their
experiments
reach
the
farmers
who
,
forgetting
that
birds
are
the_most
efficient
natural
enemies
of
insects
and
rodents
,
are
encouraged
to
try
to
get_rid_of
all
birds
that
occasionally
peck
their
grapes
or
their
blueberries
''
,
Buchheister
told
the
delegates
.
In_addition
to
urging
greater
restrictions
on
aerial
spraying
,
Buchheister
called_for
support
of
the
Wilderness
bill
,
creation
of
national
seashore
parks
,
including
Point_Reyes
;
preservation
of
the
wetlands
where
birds
breed
;
a
pesticides
co-ordination
act
;
stronger
water_pollution
control
programs
,
and
Federal
ratification
of
an
international
convention
to
halt
pollution
of
the
sea
by
oil
.
The
Reed_Rogers_Da_Fonta_Wild_Life_Sanctuary
in
Marin
county
on
Friday
officially
became
the
property
of
the
National_Audubon_Society
.
Mrs._Norman_Livermore
,

the
645
-
acre
tidelands
tract
south
of
Greenwood_Beach
to
Carl_W._Buchheister
,
president
of
the
Society
.
The
presentation
was
made
before
several
hundred
persons
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
League
at
Olney_Hall
,
College
of

Buchheister
pledged
the
land

Seventeen
years
ago
today
,
German
scientist
Willy_Fiedler
climbed
into
a
makeshift
cockpit
installed
in
a
V-1
rocket-bomb
that
was
attached
to
the
underbelly
of
a
Heinkel
bomber
.
The
World_War
2
,
German
bomber
rolled
down
a
runway
and
took_off
.
The
only
way
Fiedler
could
get_back
to
earth
alive
was
to
fly
the
pulse
jet
missile
and
land
it
on
the
airstrip
.
This
had
never
been
done
before
.
Now
a
quiet-spoken
,
middle-aged
man
,
Fiedler
is
an
aeronautical_engineer
for
Lockheed
's
Missiles
and
Space_Division
at
Sunnyvale
,
where
he
played
a
key
role
in
the
development
of
the
Navy
's
Polaris
missile
.
He
sat
in
his
office
yesterday
and
recalled
that
historic
flight
in
1944
.
``
The
first
two
pilots
had
crashed
''
,
he
said
.
``
I
had
developed
the
machines
and
therefore
knew
them
.
It
was
time
to
go_up
myself
''
.
Fiedler
was
then
technical
director
of
Hitler
's
super-secret
``
Reichenberg
project
''
,
which
remained
unknown
to
the
Allies
until
after
the
war
.
About
200
of
the
special
V-1
rocket-bombs
were
to
be
made
ready
for
manned
flight
with
an
explosive
warhead
.
The
target
was
Allied
shipping
-
a
desperate
effort
to
stave_off
the
Allied
invasion
of
Europe
.
The
success
of
the
project
depended_upon
Fiedler
's
flight
.
Squeezed
into
the
few
cubic_feet
normally
filled
by
the
rocket
's
automatic
guidance
mechanism
,
the
scientist
waited
while
the
bomber
gained
altitude
.
At
12000
feet
,
Fiedler
signaled
``
release
''
,
and
started
the
roaring
pulse-jet
engine
-
then
streaked
away
from
beneath
the
Heinkel
.
To
the
German
pilot
in
the
bomber
the
rocket
became
a
faint
black
speck
,
hurtling
through
the
sky
at
the
then
incredible
speed
of
420
m.
p.
h.
.
It
was
probably
man
's
first
successful
flight
in
a
missile
.
``
She
flew
beautifully
''
,
said
Fiedler
.
``
There
was
only
one
power
control
-
a
valve
to
adjust
the
fuel
flow
.
I
had
exactly
20
minutes
to
get
down
to
the
test
strip
''
.
Using
a
steering_system
that
controlled
the
modified
rocket
's
tail
surfaces
and
wings
equipped
with
ailerons
,
Fiedler
was
to
land
the
missile
on
a
skid
especially
bolted
under
the
fuselage
.
He
managed
to
maneuver
the
missile
to
a
landing
speed
of
200
m.
p.
h.
-
fast
even
for
a
modern
jet_plane
touchdown
-
and
banked
into
the
airfield
.
Moments
later
the
V-1
skimmed
across
the
landing_strip
,
edging
closer
and
closer
to
a
touchdown
-
then
in
a
streamer
of
dust
it
landed
.
Fiedler
went_on
to
make
several
other
test
flights
before
German
pilots
took_over
the
Reichenberg
missiles
.
The
missiles
were
to
be
armed
with
an
underwater
bomb
.
Pilots
would
steer
them
in
a
suicide
dive
into
the
water
,
striking
below
the
waterline
of
individual
ships
.
A
crack
corps
of
50
pilots
was
formed
from
the
ranks
of
volunteers
,
but
the
project
was
halted
before
the
end
of
the
war
,
and
the
missiles
later
fell_into
Allied
hands
.
Now
a
family_man
with
three
children
,
Fiedler
lives
in
a
quiet
residential
area
near
the
Lockheed
plant
at
Sunnyvale
.
His
spare_time
is
spent
in
soaring
gliders
.
``
It
's
so
quiet
''
,
he
said
,
``
so
slow
,
serene
-
and
so
challenging
''
.

:
``
Leading
Nations

``
They

A
federal
grand_jury
called
10
witnesses
yesterday
in
an
investigation
of
the
affairs
of
Ben_Stein
,
47
,
who
collected
big
fees
as
a
``
labor
consultant
''
and
operator
of
a
janitors
'
service
.
Before
he
testified
for
20
minutes
,
Stein
,
who
lives
at
3300
Lake_Shore_dr.
,
admitted
to
reporters
that
he
had
a
wide
acquaintance
with
crime
syndicate
hoodlums
.
Among
his
gangland
buddies
,
he
said
,
were
Joseph
[
Joey
]
Glimco
,
a
mob
labor
racketeer
,
and
four
gang
gambling
chiefs
,

[
Slim
]
Alex
,
Ralph_Pierce
,
Joe
[
Caesar
]
DiVarco
,
and
Jimmy

Allegretti
.
Another
hoodlum
,
Louis_Arger
,
drew
$
39000
from
Stein
's
janitor
firm
,
the
National_Maintenance
company
,
in
three
years
ending
in
1959
,
Stein
disclosed
in
an
interview
.
``
I
put
Arger
on
the
payroll
because
he
promised
to
get
my
firm
the
stevedore
account
at
Navy
pier
''
,
Stein
said
.
``
But
Arger
never
was
able
to
produce
it
,
so
I
cut
him
off
my
payroll
''
.
Other
witnesses
,
after
appearances
before
the
jury
,
which
reportedly
is
probing
into
possible
income_tax
violations
,
disclosed
that
government
prosecutors
were
attempting
to
connect
Stein
and
his
company
with
a_number_of
gangsters
,
including
Glimco
and
Alex
.
The
federal
lawyers
,
according
to
their
witnesses
,
also
were
tracing
Stein
's
fees
as
a
labor
consultant
.
Under
scrutiny
,
two
of
the
witnesses
said
,
were
payments
and
loans
to
Stein
's
National_Maintenance
company
at
543
Madison_st.
.
The
company
supplies
janitors
and
workmen
for
McCormick_Place
and
factories
,
liquor
firms
,
and
other
businesses
.
Among
the
witnesses
were
Ed_J._Lee
,

;
Jerome_Leavitt
,
a
partner
in
the
Union_Liquor
company
,
3247
S._Kedzie

operator
of
a
Glimco
dominated
deodorant
firm
,
the
Best
Sanitation
and
Supply
company
,
1215
Blue_Island
av.
.
Lee
said
he
had
told
the
jury
that
he
made
an
agreement
in
April
with
Stein
to
supply
and
supervise
janitors
in
McCormick_Place
.
Stein
's
fee
,
Lee
said
,
was
10
per_cent
of
the
janitors
'
pay
.
Stein
estimated
this
amount
at
``
about
$
1500
or
$
1600
a
month
''
.
Leavitt
,
as
he
entered
the
jury
room
,
said
he
was
prepared
to
answer
questions
about
the
$
12500
his
liquor
firm
paid
to
Stein
for
``
labor
consultant
work
''
with
five
unions
which
organized
Leavitt
's
workers
.
Leavitt
identified
the
unions
as
a
warehouseman
's
local
,
the
teamsters
union
,
a
salesman
's
union
,
the
janitors
'
union
,
and
a
bottling
workers
'
union
.
Government
attorneys
,
Leavitt
said
,
have
questioned
him
closely
about
``
five
or
six
loans
''
totaling
about
$
40000
which
the
liquor
company
made
to
Stein
in
the
last
year
.
All_of
the
loans
,
in
amounts
up_to
$
5000
each
,
have
been
repaid
by
Stein
,
according
to
Leavitt
.
Stein
said
he
needed
the
money
,
Leavitt
said
,
to
``
meet
the
payroll
''
at
National_Maintenance
company
.

The
radiation
station
of
the
Chicago
board
of
health
recorded
a
reading
of
1
micro-microcurie
of
radiation
per
cubic_meter
of
air
over
Chicago
yesterday
.
The
reading
,
which
has
been
watched
with
interest
since
Russia
's
detonation
of
a
super
bomb
Monday
,
was
4
on
Tuesday
and
7
last
Saturday
,
a_level
far
below
the
danger
point
,
according
to
the
board
of
health
.
The
weather_bureau
has
estimated
that
radioactive
fallout
from
the
test
might
arrive
here
next
week
.
A
board
of
health
spokesman
said
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
an
increase
in
the
level
here
will
occur
as
a
result
of
the
detonation

Curtis_Allen_Huff
,
41
,
of
1630
Lake
av.
,
Wilmette
,
was
arrested
yesterday
on
a
suppressed
federal
warrant
charging
him
with
embezzling
an
undetermined
amount_of_money
from
the
First_Federal
Savings_and_Loan_association
,
1
S._Dearborn_st.
,
where
he
formerly
was
employed
as
an
attorney
.
Federal
prosecutors
estimated
that
the
amount
may
total
$
20000
,
altho
a
spokesman
for
the
association
estimated
its
loss
at
approximately
$
10000
.
Huff
's
attorney
,
Antone_F._Gregorio
,
quoted
his
client
as
saying
that
part
of
the
embezzlement
represented
money
paid
to
Huff
,
as
attorney
for
the
loan
association
,
in
satisfaction
of
mechanic
's
liens
on
property
on_which
the
association
held
mortgages
.
Huff
told
Gregorio
that
he
took
the
money
to
pay
``
the
ordinary
bills
and
expenses
of
suburban
living
''
.
Huff
,
who
received
a
salary
of
$
109
a
week
from
the
loan
association
from
October
of
1955
until
September
of_this
year
,
said
that
his
private
practice
was
not
lucrative
.
Huff
lives
with
his
wife
,
Sue
,
and
their
four
children
,
6
to
10
years
old
,
in
a
$
25000
home
with
a
$
17000
mortgage
.
The
complaint
on_which
the
warrant
was
issued
was
filed
by
Leo_Blaber
,
an
attorney
for
the
association
.
The
shortage
was
discovered
after
Huff
failed
to
report
for
work
on
Sept.
18
.
On_that
date
,
according
to
Gregorio
,
Huff
left
his
home
and
took
a
room
in
the
New_Lawrence
hotel
at
1020
Lawrence
av.
.
There
,
Gregorio
said
,
Huff
wrote
a
complete
statement
of
his
offense
.
Later
,
Huff
cashed
three
checks
for
$
100
each
at
the
Sherman_House
,
using
a
credit_card
.
All
bounced
.
When
Huff
attempted
to
cash
another
$
100
check
there
Monday
,
hotel
officials
called
police
.
Greece
