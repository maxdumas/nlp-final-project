There
were
thirty-eight
patients
on
the
bus
the
morning
I
left
for
Hanover
,
most_of
them
disturbed
and
hallucinating
.
An
interne
,
a
nurse
and
two
attendants
were
in
charge
of
us
.
I
felt
lonely
and
depressed
as
I
stared
out
the
bus
window
at
Chicago
's
grim
,
dirty
West_Side
.
It
seemed
incredible
,
as
I
listened
to
the
monotonous
drone
of
voices
and
smelled
the
fetid
odors
coming
from
the
patients
,
that
technically
I
was
a
ward
of
the
state
of
Illinois
,
going_to
a
hospital
for
the
mentally_ill
.
I
suddenly
thought_of
Mary_Jane
Brennan
,
the
way
her
pretty
eyes
could
flash
with_anger
,
her
quiet
competence
,
the
gentleness
and
sweetness
that
lay
just
beneath
the
surface
of
her
defenses
.
We
had
become
good
friends
during
my
stay
at
Cook_County_Hospital
.
I
had
told
her
enough
about
myself
to
offset
somewhat
the
damaging
stories
that
had
appeared
in
local
newspapers
after
my
little
adventure
in
Marshall_Field
+
Co.
.
She
knew
that
I
lived
at
a
good
address
on
the
Gold_Coast
,
that
I
had
once
been
a
medical_student
and
was
thinking_of
returning
to
the
university
to
finish
my
medical
studies
.
She
knew
also
that
I
was
unmarried
and
without
a
single
known
relative
.
She
was
n't
quite
sure
that
I
felt
enough
remorse
about
my
drinking
,
or
that
I
would
not
return
to
it
once
I
was
out
and
on
my
own
again
.
This
had
worried
her
.
``
I
read
those
newspaper
stories
about
you
''
,
she
had
said
.
``
You
must
have
loved
that
girl
very_much
,
but
you
could
n't
have
meant
it
when
you
said
that
you
wanted
to
kill
her
''
.
``
Why
do
you
say
that
''
?
I
asked
.
``
I
was
full
of
booze
and
,
well
,
a
drunk
is
apt
to
do
anything
he
says
he
'll
do
''
.
Nonsense
!
I
grew_up
in
an
Irish
neighborhood
on
Chicago
's
West_Side
.
Do
n't
tell
me
about
drunks
.
You
're
not
the
kind
to
go
violent
.
Were
you
in_love
with_that
girl
``
?
``
Would
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
I
were
,
Mary_Jane
''
?
She
met
my
eyes
,
suddenly
angry
.
``
I
would
n't
have
gone
into
nursing
if
I
did
n't
care
about
people
.
I
'm
interested
in
every
patient
I
've
helped
take
care
of
.
When
I
think_of
people
like
you
,
well
,
I

-
``
You
what
,
Mary_Jane
''
?
``
You
are
young
,
intelligent
,
have
a
whole
lifetime
before
you
to
make
something
worth
while
of
yourself
,
but
you
mess
it
up
with
whiskey
,
indifference
,
self-destructive
attitudes
.
I
do
n't
blame
that
girl
for
breaking
her
engagement
with
you
.
Was
she
pretty
''
?
``
Oh
,
yes
''
,
I
said
,
feeling
annoyed
,
``
she
was
very
pretty
.
You
do
n't
believe
that
I
'm
going_back
to
medical_school
and
finish
,
do
you
''
?
``
Why
should
I
?
I
've
worked
this
ward
for
three
months
now
.
We
keep
getting
the
same
ones
back
again_and_again
.
They
all
mean
well
,
have
great
promises
to
make
when
they
are
about
to
go_home
,
but
drinking
is
their
sickness
.
You
've
not
seemed
like
them
,
but
maybe
you
are
.
You
've
treated
your
stay
here
like
a
big
joke
.
It
's
not
a
joke
to
be
sent
to
a
place
like
this
or
to
Hanover
.
I
wanted
to
go_to
college
,
to

-
``
Why
did
n't
you
''
?
I
asked
.
``
Chicago
has
some
of
the
best
''
-
Her
eyes
flashed
angrily
.
``
That
's
what
I
mean
about
you
,
Anderson
''
,
she
said
.
``
You
do
n't
seem
to
know
much
about
reality
.
I
'll
tell
you
why
I
did
n't
go_to
college
;
I
'm
the
oldest
of
six
children
.
My
father
's
a
policeman
and
makes
less_than
seven
thousand
dollars
a
year
.
There
was
no
money
for
tuition
,
for
clothes
,
for
all
the
things
you
apparently
take_for_granted
.
Nurses
'
training
here
does
n't
cost
anything
.
They
even
pay
me
six
dollars
a
month
.
I
think
it
's
a
good_deal
.
I
'm
going_to
become
a
good
nurse
,
and
I
've
got
two
baby
brothers
that
are
going_to
have
college
if
I
have
to
work_at
my
profession
until
I
'm
an
old_maid
to
give
it
to
them
''
.
``
Do
you
have
a
boy
friend
''
?
I
asked
.
``
That
's
none
of
your
business
''
,
she
said
,
then
changed
the
subject
.
``
What
about
your
father
and
mother
,
do
n't
you
think_of
them
when
you
're
in
a
place
like
this
''
?
``
My
father
and
mother
died
when
I
was
two
years
old
''
,
I
said
.
``
My
aunt
raised
me
.
Aunt_Mary
died
when
I
was
doing
my
military_service
.
I
have
no
one
but
myself
to
worry
about
''
.
Something
in
my
voice
must
have
touched
her
deeply
because
her
anger
passed
quickly
,
and
she
turned_away
to
keep
me
from
seeing
her
face
.
``
I
'm
sorry
''
,
she
said
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'd
do
without
my
family
.
We
've
always
been
so
close
''
.
``
Tell
me
more
about
them
''
.
Her
eyes
became
bright
as
she
talked_about
her
father
and
mother
,
aunts
and
uncles
,
cousins
.
Listening
,
I
felt
cheated
and
lonely
as
only
an
orphan
can
.
When
she
had
finished
I
said
:
``
Your
dad
sounds
like
a
good
father
and
a
good
policeman
.
I
'll
bet
he
would
n't
be
pleased
if
a
rumdum
like
me
were
to
ask
his
daughter
for
a
date
-
I
mean
,
after
I
'm
out
of
the
hospital
,
a
month
or_so
from
now
''
.
``
My
father
is
a
sergeant
of
detectives
and
has
been
attached
to
Homicide
for
five
years
.
He
's
a
pretty
good
judge
of
character
,
Anderson
.
I
do
n't
think
he
'd
mind
too_much
if
he
were
sure
you
'd
decided
not
to
be
a
rumdum
in_the_future
''
.
``
What
about
you
?
How
would
you
feel
about
it
if
I
were
to
ask
you
for
a
date
when
I
get_through
at
Hanover
''
?
``
If
I
thought
you
were
serious
about
going_back
to
school
,
that
you
'd
learned
something
from
your
experiences
here
and
at
Hanover
-
well
,
I
might
consider
such
an
offer
.
What
about
your
&
&
&
that
girl
you
were
going_to
kill
''
?
It
suddenly
seemed
very
important
to
me
that
Mary_Jane
Brennan
should
know
the
truth
about
me
-
that
I
was
not
the
confused
,
sick
,
irresponsible
person
she
believed
me
to
be
.
``
There
are
things
about
me
that
I
can
n't
tell
you
now
,
Mary_Jane
''
,
I
said
,
``
but
if
you
'll
go_out
to
dinner
with
me
when
I
get_out
of
Hanover
,
I
'd
like
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
.
I
can
say
this
:
I
'm
dead
serious
about
going_back
to
school
.
As
for
that
other
girl
,
let
's
just
say
that
I
never
want
to
see
her
again
.
You
will
get
to
come
home
on
long
weekends
from
Hanover
,
won
n't
you
''
?
``
Yes
,
I
'll
get
one
overnight
a
month
''
.
``
We
'll
go_up
to
the
Edgewater_Beach_Hotel
for
dinner
''
,
I
said
.
``
Do
you
like
to
dance
?
They
always
have
a
good
orchestra
''
.
``
I
like
to
dance
''
,
she
said
,
then
turned
and
walked
away
.
There
had
n't
been
anything
really
personal
in
her
interest
in
me
.
I
knew
that
.
It
was
just
that
she
felt
deeply
about
every
patient
on
the
ward
and
wanted
to
believe
that
they
might
benefit
from
their
treatment
there
.
Now
,
riding
this
hospital
bus
,
feeling
isolated
and
utterly
alone
,
I
knew
that
she
was
genuine
and
unique
,
quite
unlike
any
girl
I
had
known
before
.
It
seemed
the_most
important
thing
in
my
life
at
this
moment
that
she
should
know
the
real
truth
about
me
.
It
was
a
fantastic
story
.
Only
two
people
in
the
state
of
Illinois
knew
that
I
was
entering
Hanover_State_Hospital
under
an
assumed_name
,
or
why
.
It
was
unlikely
that
any
girl
as
sharp
as
Mary_Jane
Brennan
would
believe
it
without
proof
.
But
I
had
the
proof
,
all
documented
in
a
legal
agreement
which
I
would
show
her
the
moment
I
was
free
to
do
so
.
As
the
bus
turned
into
the
main
highway
and
headed
toward
Hanover
I
settled
back
in
my
seat
and
closed
my
eyes
,
thinking_over
the
events
of
the
past
two_weeks
,
trying
to
put
the
pieces
in_order
.
I
wondered
suddenly
as
I
listened
to
the
disconnected
jabberings
coming
from
the
patient
behind
me
,
if
I
had
not
perhaps
imagined
it
all
.
Perhaps
this
was
reality
and
Dale_Nelson
,
the
actor
,
was
delusion
;
a
figment
of
Carl_Anderson
's
imagination
.
I
had
come
to
Chicago
from
New_York
early
in
September
with
a
dramatic_production
called
Ask_Tony
.
It
was
a
bad
play
,
real
grade-A
turkey
,
which
only
a
prevalence
of
angels
with
grandiose
dreams
of
capital_gain
and
tax
money
to
burn
could
have
put
into
rehearsal
.
No
one
,
not
even
the
producer
,
had
any
real
hope
of
getting
it
back
to
Broadway
.
But
because
it
was
a
suspense
gangster
story
of
the
Capone
era
,
many_of
us
felt
that
it
might
catch_on
for
a
run
in
Chicago
,
continue
as
a
road
company
,
and
eventually
become
a
movie
.
Such
optimism
was
completely
unjustified
.
The
critics
literally
screamed
their
indignation
.
Ask_Tony
was
doomed
from
the
moment
Kupcinet
leveled
on_it
in
his
Sun-Times
column
.
We
opened
on
Friday
and
closed
the
following
Monday
.
Out
of
the
entire
cast
I
alone
received
good
notices
for
my
portrayal
of
a
psychopathic
killer
.
This
let
me
in_for
a_lot_of
kidding
from
the
rest
of
the
company
,
two
members
of_which
were
native
Chicagoans
.
We
were
paid_off
Tuesday
morning
and
given
tickets
back
to
New_York
.
I
felt
lonely
and
depressed
as
I
packed
my
bags
at
the
Croydon_Hotel
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
my
life
was
destined
to
be
one
brilliant
failure
after
another
.
I
had
been
among
the
top
third
in
my
class
at
N._Y._U.
,
had
wanted
desperately
to
go_to
medical_school
,
but
I
'd
run_out
of
money
and
energy
at_the_same_time
.
Then
later
I
had
quit
my
safe
,
secure
five-a-week
spot
on
a
network
soap_opera
to
take
a
part
in_this
play
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
I
was
not_only
unlucky
but
quite
stupid
as_well
.
I
knew
that
I
'd
soon
be
back
working
as
an
orderly
at
the
hospital
or
as
a
counterman
at
Union_News
or
Schraffts
while
waiting
for
another
acting
job
to
open
.
It
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
I
did
not
particularly
like
acting
,
that
I
was
at
some
sort_of
crossroads
and
would
have
to
decide
soon
what
I
was
going_to
do
with
my
life
.
I
closed
the
last
bag
and
stood
all
three
at
the
door
for
the
bellboy
to
pick_up
,
then
went_to
the
bathroom
for
a
drink
of
water
.
The
telephone
rang
.
When
I
answered
it
a
voice
too
dignified
and
British
to
be
real
said
,
``
Is
this
Mr._Dale_Nelson
,
the
actor
''
?
``
All_right
''
,
I
said
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
bastards
lay_off
for_a_while
''
?
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
''
?
``
All_right
.
This
is
Dale_Nelson
,
the
actor
''
.
``
Good
.
I
'm
calling
you
,
Mr._Nelson
,
at
the
request
of
Mr._Phillip_Wycoff
.
Could
you
possibly
have
lunch
with
him
today
?
His
car
could
pick
you
up
at
your
hotel
at
twelve
''
.
I
smiled
.
``
You
'll
send
the
Rolls-Royce
,
of_course
''
?
``
Yes
,
of_course
,
Mr._Nelson
''
.
I
started
to
say
something
else
appropriate
,
but
the
man
had
hung_up
.
I
finally
went
downstairs
to
the
bar
off
the
main
lobby
where
most_of
the
cast
were
drowning
their
sorrows
over
the
untimely
passing
of
Ask_Tony
.
They
all
bowed
low
as
I
approached
them
.
``
All_right
,
you
bastards
''
,
I
said
,
``
the
great
actor
is_about
to
buy
a
drink
''
.
I
laid
a
tenspot
on
the
bar
and
motioned
to
the
bartender
to
serve
a
round
.
He
had
just
returned
my
change
when
the
doorman
came_in
off
the
street
to
page
me
.
I
walked
over
to
him
.
``
You
Mr._Nelson
''
?
he
asked
.
``
That
's
right
''
.
``
Mr.
Wycoff
's
car
is
waiting
for
you
at
the
east
entrance
''
.
I
followed
him
out
through
the
lobby
to
the
street
.
An
ancient
Rolls-Royce
,
as
shiningly
impressive
as
the
day
it
came
off
the
ship
,
was
parked
at
the
curb
.
The
elderly
chauffeur
,
immaculate
in
a
dark
uniform
,
stood
stiffly
at
attention
holding
open
the
door
of
the
town
car
.
