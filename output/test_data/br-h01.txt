series
of
SBA
publications
.
These
publications
,
written
especially
for
the
managers
or
owners
of
small

,
indirectly
aid
in
community
development
programs
.
They
are
written
by
specialists
in
numerous
types
of
business_enterprises
,
cover
a
wide
range
of
subjects
,
and
are
directed
to
the
needs
and
interests
of
the
small
firm
.
SBA
offers
Administrative_Management_Courses
,
which
are
designed
to
improve
the
management
efficiency
and
``

''
of
small

community
.
SBA
cosponsors
these
courses
with

groups
.
Through
the
SBA
's
Management_Counseling_Program
,
practical
,
personalized
advice
on
sound
management
principles
is
available

part
of
the
continuing
activities
of
the
Small_Business_Administration
,
aid
community
economic
development
programs
.
These

,
``

meetings
usually
are
sponsored
by
local
banks
,
Chambers_of_Commerce
,
trade
associations
,
or

Production
specialists

SBA
serves
also
as
a
clearing_house
for
information
on
products
and
processes
particularly
adaptable
for
exploitation
by
small
firms
.
This
may
be
helpful
in
improving
the
competitive
position
of
established
firms
through
diversification
and
expansion
or
through
more
economical
utilization
of
plant
capacity
.
Production
specialists
are_available
in
SBA
regional
offices
to
help
individual
small
business_concerns
with
technical
production
problems
.
These
problems
frequently
arise
where
a
firm
is
making
items
for
the
Government
not
directly
along
the
lines
of
its
normal
civilian
business
or
where
the
Government
specifications
require
operations
that
the
firm
did
not
understand
when
it
undertook
the
contract
.
Production
assistance
often
takes
the
form
of
locating
tools
or
materials
which
are
urgently
needed
.
Advice
is
given
also
on
problems
of
plant
location
and
plant
space
.
The
property
sales
assistance
program
is
designed
to
assist
small
business_concerns
that
may
wish
to
buy
property
offered
for
sale
by
the
Federal_Government
.
Under
this
program
,
property
sales
specialists
in
the
Small_Business_Administration
regional
offices
help
small
business_concerns
to
locate
Federal
property
for_sale
and
insure
that
small
firms
have
the
opportunity
to
bid
competitively
for
surplus
personal
and
real_property
and
certain
natural_resources
,
including
timber
from
the
national
forests
.
SBA
works
closely
with
the
principal
property
disposal
installations
of
the
Federal_Government
in
reviewing
proposed
sales
programs
and
identifying
those
types
of
property
that
small
business_concerns
are
most
likely
to
be
interested
in
purchasing
.
Proposed
property
sales
of
general
interest
to
small
business_concerns
are
publicized
through
SBA
regional
news
releases
,
and
by
``
flyers
''
directed
to
the
small
business_concerns
.
Each
SBA
regional
office
also
maintains
a
``
want
''
list
of
surplus
property
,
principally
machinery
and
equipment
,
desired
by
small
business_concerns
in
its
area
.
When
suitable
equipment
is_located
by
the
SBA
representative
,
the
small
business_concern
is
contacted
and
advised
on
when
,
where
,
and
how
to
bid
on
such
property
.
Section
8
(
b
)
(
2
)
of
the
Small_Business_Act
,
as
amended
,
authorizes
the
SBA
to
make
a
complete
inventory
of
the
productive
facilities
of
small
business_concerns
.
The
Administration
maintains
a
productive
facilities
inventory
of
small
business
industrial
concerns
that
have
voluntarily
registered
.
It
is
kept
in
each
Regional
office
for
the
small
firms
within
the
region
.
Purpose
of
this
inventory
is
to
include
all
eligible
productive
facilities
in
SBA
's
facilities
register
so
that
the
small
business_concerns
may
have
an
opportunity
to
avail
themselves
of
the
services
authorized
by
the
Congress
in
establishing
the
Small_Business_Administration
.
These
services
include
procurement
and
technical
assistance
and
notice
of
surplus
sales
and
invitations
to
bid
on
Government
contracts
for
products
and
services
within
the
registrants
'
field_of_operations
.
SBA
can
make
complete
facilities
inventories
of
all
small

surplus
areas
within
budgetary
and

SBA
makes
loans
to
individual
small
business_firms
,
providing
them
with
financing
when
it
is
not
otherwise
available
through
private
lending
sources
on
reasonable
terms
.
Many
such
loans
have
been
made
to
establish
small
concerns
or
to
aid
in
their
growth
,
thereby
contributing
substantially
to
community
development
programs
.
SBA
loans
,
which
may
be
made
to
small
manufacturers
,
small
business
pools
,
wholesalers
,
retailers
,
service
establishments
and
other
small
businesses
(
when
financing
is
not
otherwise
available
to
them
on
reasonable
terms
)
,
are
to
finance
business
construction
,
conversion
,
or
expansion
;
the
purchase
of
equipment
,
facilities
,
machinery
,
supplies
,
or
materials
;
or
to
supply
working_capital
.
Evidence
that
other
sources
of
financing
are
unavailable
must
be
provided
.
SBA
business
loans
are
of
two
types
:
``
participation
''
and
``
direct
''
.
Participation_loans
are
those
made
jointly
by
the
SBA
and
banks
or
other
private
lending_institutions
.
Direct_loans
are
those
made
by
SBA
alone
.
To
qualify
for
either
type
of
loan
,
an
applicant
must
be
a
small
business
or
approved
small
business
``
pool
''
and
must
meet
certain
credit
requirements
.
A
small
business
is
defined
as
one
which
is
independently
owned
and
operated
and
which
is
not
dominant
in
its
field
.
In_addition
,
the
SBA
uses
such
criteria
as
number
of
employees
and
dollar_volume
of
the
business
.
The
credit
requirements
stipulate
that
the
applicant
must
have
the
ability
to
operate
the
business
successfully
and
have
enough
capital
in
the
business
so
that
,
with
loan
assistance
from
the
SBA
,
it
will
be
able
to
operate
on
a
sound
financial
basis
.
A
proposed
loan
must
be
for
sound
purposes
or
sufficiently
secured
so_as
to
assure
a
reasonable
chance
of
repayment
.
The
record
of
past
earnings
and
prospects
for
the
future
must
indicate
it
has
the
ability
to
repay
the
loan
out
of
current
and
anticipated
income
.
The
amount
which
may
be
borrowed
from
the
SBA
depends_on
how
much
is
required
to
carry_out
the
intended
purpose
of
the
loan
.
The
maximum
loan
which
SBA
may
make
to
any
one
borrower
is
$
350000
.
Business
loans
generally
are
repayable
in
regular
installments
-
usually
monthly
,
including
interest
at
the
rate
of
5
-
1/2
percent
per_annum
on
the
unpaid
balance
-
and
have
a
maximum
maturity
of
10
years
;
the
term
of
loans
for
working_capital
is
6
years
.

To
encourage
exploration
for
domestic
sources
of
minerals
,
the
Office_of_Minerals_Exploration
(
OME
)
of
the
U.S._Department_of_the_Interior
offers
financial
assistance
to
firms
and
individuals
who
desire
to
explore
their
properties
or
claims
for
1
or
more
of
the
32
mineral
commodities
listed
in
the
OME
regulations
.
This
help
is
offered
to
applicants
who
ordinarily
would
not
undertake
the
exploration
under
present
conditions
or
circumstances
at
their
sole
expense
and
who
are
unable
to
obtain
funds
from
commercial
sources
on
reasonable
terms
.
Each
applicant
is
required
to
own
or
have
sufficient
interest
in
the
property
to
be
explored
.
The
Government
will
contract
with
an
eligible
applicant
to
pay
up_to
one-half
of
the
cost
of
approved
exploration
work
as
it
progresses
.
The
applicant
pays
the
rest
of
the
cost
,
but
his
own
time
spent
on
the
work
and
charges
for
the
use
of
equipment
which
he
owns
may
be
applied
toward
his
share
of
the
cost
.
Funds
contributed
by
the
Government
are
repaid
by
a
royalty
on
production
from
the
property
.
If
nothing
is
produced
,
there
is
no
obligation
to
repay
.
A
5
-
percent
royalty
is
paid
on
any
production
during
the
period
the
contract
is
in_effect
;
if
the
Government
certifies
that
production
may
be
possible
from
the
property
,
the
royalty
obligation
continues
for
the
10
-
year
period
usually
specified
in
the
contract
or
until
the
Government
's
contribution
is
repaid
with
interest
.
The
royalty
applies
to
both
principal
and
interest
,
but
it
never
exceeds
5
percent
.
