For_the_first_time
in
history
the
entire
world
is
dominated_by
two
large
,
powerful
nations
armed
with
murderous
nuclear_weapons
that
make
conventional
warfare
of
the
past
a
nullity
.
The
United_States
and
Soviet_Russia
have
enough
nuclear_weapons
to
destroy
all
nations
.
Recent
statements
by
well-known
scientists
regarding
the
destructive
power
of
the
newest
nuclear
bombs
and
the
deadly
fall-outs
should
be
sufficient
to
still
the
voices
of
those
who
advocate
nuclear
warfare
instead
of
negotiations
.
President_Kennedy
was
right
when
he
said
,
``
We
shall
never
negotiate
out
of
fear
and
we
never
shall
fear
to
negotiate
''
.
I
have
just
returned
from
a
seven-week
trip
to
Europe
and
the
Far_East
.
It
is
quite
evident
that
the
people
of
Western
Europe
are
overwhelmingly
opposed
to
participation
in
a
nuclear
war
.
The
fact
is
that
the
Italians
,
French
and
British
know
that
they
have
no
defense
against
nuclear
bombs
.
We
have
no
right
to
criticize
them
,
as
they
realize
they
would
be
sitting_ducks
in
a
nuclear
war
.
We
should
stand
firmly
and
courageously
for
our
right
to
free
access
into
Berlin
.
It
would
be
criminal
folly
if
the
Communists
tried
to
prevent
us
.
But
there
is
nothing
we
can
do
to
stop
Soviet_Russia
from
granting
de_facto
recognition
to
East_Germany
.
Soviet_Russia
has
been
invaded
twice
by
German
troops
in
a
generation
.
In
the
last
war
Russia
lost
more_than
ten
million
killed
and
its
lands
and
factories
were
devastated
.
The
truth
is
that
Communist_Russia
fears
the
resurgence
of
German
militarism
.
Berlin
is
merely
being
used
by
Moscow
as
a
stalking_horse
.
Actually
,
the
Communists
,
out
of
fear
of
a
united
and
armed
Germany
,
would
probably
be
willing
to
agree
to
a
disarmed
Germany
that
would
be
united
and
neutral
and
have
its
independence
guaranteed
by
the
U._N.
.
If
the
Communists
are
sincere
in
wanting
a
united
,
neutral
and
disarmed
Germany
,
it
might
well
be
advantageous
for
the
German
people
in_this
nuclear
age
.
It
could
provide
security
without
cost
of
armaments
and
increase
German
prosperity
and
lessen
taxation
.
France
and
other
Western
European_nations
likewise
fear
a
rearmed
Germany
.
If
the
German
people
favor
such
a
settlement
we
should
not
oppose
Germany
following
the
example
of
Austria
.
President_Kennedy
has
urged
a
peace
race
on
disarmament
that
might
be
called
``
Operation_Survival
''
which
has
many
facets
.
Why
not
make
a
beginning
with
a
united
and
disarmed
Germany
whose
neutrality
and
immunity
from
nuclear
bombing
would
be
guaranteed
by
the
Big
Four
powers
and
the
United_States
?
A
united
Germany
,
freed
of
militarism
,
might
be
the
first
step
toward
disarmament
and
peace
in
a
terrorized
and
tortured
world
.
In
your
editorial
of
Sept.
30
``
The
Smoldering
Congo
''
you
make
the
following
comment
:
``
Far
too
many
states
are
following
the
Russian
example
in
refusing
to
pay
their
assessments
.
It
is
up_to
the
Assembly
to
take
action
against
them
.
They
are
violating
their
Charter
obligation
,
the
prescribed
penalty
for
which
is
suspension
of
membership
or
expulsion
''
.
I
would
like
to
quote
from
the
Charter
of
the
United_Nations
:
``
Article
17
,
Section
1
:
The
General_Assembly
shall
consider
and
approve
the
budget
of
the
Organization
.
``
Section
2
:
The
expenses
of
the
Organization
shall
be
borne
by
the
Members
as
apportioned
by
the
General_Assembly
.
``
Article
19
:
A
Member
of
the
United_Nations
which
is
in_arrears
in
the
payment
of
its
financial
contributions
to
the
Organization
shall
have
no
vote
in
the
General_Assembly
if
the
amount
of
its
arrears
equals
or
exceeds
the
amount
of
the
contributions
due
from_it
for
the
preceding
two
full
years
''
.
The
U._S._S._R.
and
her
followers
are
careful
in
paying
their
obligations
to
the
regular
budget
.
But
they
refuse
,
as
do
the
Arab
states
,
to
support
the
United_Nations
'
expenses
of
maintaining
the
United_Nations
Emergency_Force
in_the_Middle
East
as
a
buffer
between
Egypt
and
Israel
,
and
the
U._N.
troops
in
the
Congo
,
which
expenses
are
not
covered
by
the
regular
budget
of
the
United_Nations
,
but
by
a
special
budget
.
According
to
the
official
interpretation
of
the
Charter
,
a
member
cannot
be
penalized
by
not
having
the
right_to_vote
in
the
General_Assembly
for
nonpayment
of
financial_obligations
to
the
``
special
''
United_Nations
'
budgets
,
and
of_course
cannot
be
expelled
from
the
Organization
(
which
you
suggested
in
your
editorial
)
,
due_to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
Charter
for
expulsion
.
In
your
Sept.
27
editorial
appraisal
of
the
work
of
the
First
Session
of
the
Eighty-seventh_Congress
you
referred
to
the
lack
of
``
consciousness
of
destiny
in
a
time
of
acute
national
and
world
peril
''
.
Yet
your
list
of
things
left
undone
did
not
include
repeal
of
the
Connally
amendment
to
this
country
's
domestic
jurisdiction
reservation
to
its
Adherence
to
the
Statute
of
the
International_Court_of_Justice
.
The
Connally
amendment
says
that
the
United_States
,
rather_than
the
court
,
shall
determine
whether
a
matter
is
essentially
within
the
domestic
jurisdiction
of
the
United_States
in
a
case
before
the
World_Court
to_which
the
United_States
is
a
party
.
If
the
case
is
thus
determined
by
us
to
be
domestic
,
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
.
Since
the
Connally
amendment
has
the
effect
of
giving
the
same
right
to
the
other
party
to
a
dispute
with
the
United_States
,
it
also
prevents
us
from
using
the
court
effectively
.
Yet
although
the
Kennedy_Administration
,
and
the
Eisenhower_Administration
before
it
,
have
both
declared
themselves
solidly
for
repeal
of
the
Connally
amendment
,
as
contrary
to
our
best
interests
,
no
action
has
yet
been
taken
.
Our
``
destiny
''
in
these
perilous
times
should
be
to
lead
strongly
in
the
pursuit
of
peace
,
with
justice
,
under
law
.
To
achieve
this
destiny
,
acts
as
well
as
words
are
needed
-
not_only
acts
that
lead
to
physical
strength
but
also
acts
that
lead
to
strength
based
on
right
doing
and
respect
.
What
better
affirmative
step
could
be
taken
to
this
end
than
repeal
of
the
Connally
amendment
-
an
act
which
could
expose
the
United_States
to
no
practical
risk
yet
would
put
an
end
to
our
self-judging
attitude
toward
the
court
,
enable
us
to
utilize
it
,
and
advance
in
a
tangible
way
the
cause
of
international_law
and
order
?
We
believe
that
the
list
of
vital
things
left
undone
to_date
by
the
Eighty-seventh_Congress
should
have
included
repeal
by
the
Senate
of
the
Connally
amendment
.
Many
home-bound
subway
riders
utilizing
the
Flushing-Main_Street
express
are
daily
confronted
with
the
sight
of
the
local
departing
from
the
Woodside
station
as
their
express
comes_to
a
stop
,
leaving
them
stranded
and
strained
.
To
the
tens
of
thousands
who
must
transfer
to
ride
to
Seventy-fourth_Street
and
change
for
the
IND
,
this
takes
a
daily
toll
of
time
and
temper
.
The
Transit_Authority
has
recently
placed
in_operation
``
hold
''
lights
at
BMT_Thirty-ninth
and
Fifty-ninth_Street
stations
in
Brooklyn
.
This
``
holds
''
the
local
until
the
express
passengers
change
trains
.
Without
question
,
this
time
and
temper
saver
should
be
immediately
installed
at
the
Woodside
station
.
As
a
business
man
I
have
to
use
the
telephone
constantly
,
from
three
to
four
hours
a
day
.
In
the
last
few
years
the
telephone_company
has
managed
to
automate
many
areas
of
their
service
.
It
has
not
been
any
great
mental
effort
on
my
part
to
keep_up
with
this
mechanization
which
has
brought_about
new
ways
of
dialing
.
However
,
there
are
still
several
types
of
calls
that
necessitate
the
use
of
telephone_operators
.
I
have
been
absolutely
shocked
at
the
ineptness
of
the
young_ladies
who
are
servicing
person-to-person
calls
,
special
long-distance_calls
,
etc.
.
Either
it
is
lack
of
training
,
lack
of
proper
screening
when
hiring
,
lack
of
management
or
possibly
lack
of
interest
on
the
part
of
the
telephone_company
,
which
does
have
a
Government-blessed
monopoly
.
I
disagree
with
the
writer
who
says
funeral
services
should
be
government-controlled
.
The
funeral
for
my
husband
was
just
what
I
wanted
and
I
paid
a
fair
price
,
far
less_than
I
had
expected
to
pay
.
But
the
hospitals
and
doctors
should
be
.
Recently
I
visited
the
very
remarkable
Pilgrim_School
for
retarded
children
.
Hazel_Park
donates
its
recreation
center
,
five
days
a
week
,
to
the
school
.
There
is
no
charge
and
no
state
aid
.
Kiwanis
,
American_Legion
and
other
groups
donate
small
sums
and
the
mothers
do
what
they
can
to
bring_in
dollars
for
its
support
.
There
are
70
children
there
and
the
mothers
donate
one_day
a
week
to
the
school
.
Reading
,
writing
and
simple
arithmetic
are
taught
along
with
such
crafts
as
working
in
brass
.
They
make
beautiful
objects
.
Enough
trading_stamps
were
collected
to
buy
a
12
-
passenger
station_wagon
.
Southfield
schools
furnish
an
old
45
-
passenger
bus
(
the
heater
in_which
needs
repair
since
some
of
the
children
ride
a
long
distance
and
need
the
heat
)
.
The
school
is
located
at
9
-
1
2
Mile
road
,
Woodward_Heights
.
Visitors
are
welcome
to
come
see
what
these
dedicated
mothers
can
do
.
I
was
surprised
at
Mayor_Miriani
's
defeat
,
but
perhaps
Mayor-elect_Cavanagh
can
accomplish
some
things
that
should
have
been
done
years
ago
.
Maybe
he
can
clean_out
the
white_elephants
in
some
of
the
city
departments
such_as
welfare
,
DPW
and
sanitation
.
Negligence
in
garbage
and
rubbish
collections
and
alley
cleaning
is
great
.
He
should
put
the
police
back
to
patrolling
and
walking
the
streets
at
night
.
There
should
be
better
bus_service
and
all_of
our
city
departments
and
their
various
branches
need
a
general
and
complete
overhauling
.
Our
litterbug
ordinances
are
not
enforced
and
I
have
yet
to
read
of
a
conviction
in
a
littering
case
.
Drunken
truck_drivers
in
the
city
departments
should
be
weeded_out
.
Educate
the
city
employes
to
give
real
service
to
the
public
.
After_all
,
they
are
paid
by
the
public
,
they
should
be
examples
.
At
a
recent
meeting
of
the
Women
's
Association
of
the
Trumbull_Ave._United
Presbyterian_Church
,
considerable
use
was
made
of
material
from
The
Detroit_News
on
the
King_James_version
of
the
New_Testament
versus
the
New_English_Bible
.
Some
members
of
the
organization
called
attention
also
to
the
article
on
hymns
of
inspiration
,
the
Daily_Prayer
and
Three
Minutes
a
Day
,
as
being
very
helpful
.
We
feel
that
The
Detroit_News
is
to
be
complimented
upon
arranging
for
articles
on
these
subjects
and
we
hope
that
it
will
continue
to
provide
material
along
wholesome
lines
.
Thank_you
for
the
article
by
George_Sokolsky
on
the
public
apathy
to
impudence
.
How
old
do
you
have
to
be
to
remember
when
Americans
,
especially
children
,
were
encouraged
to
be
polite
?
Why
has
this
form
of
gentility
gone_out
of
American
life
?
How
can
we
old-fashioned
parents
,
who
still
feel
that
adults
are
due
some
respect
from
children
,
battle
the
new
type
of
advertising
that
appears
on
TV
without
denying
the
children
the
use
of
television
entirely
?
Writers
of
ads
must
get
their
inspiration
from
the
attitude
of
``
modern
''
parents
they
have
observed
.
From
necessity
,
they
are
also
inspired
by
the
``
hard-sell
''
attitude
of
the
sponsor
,
so
,
finally
,
it
is
the
sponsor
who
must
take
the
responsibility
for
the
good
or
bad
taste
of
his
advertising
.
I
commend
Senator_Hart
for
his
brave
fight
to
establish
a
national_park
in
the
dunes
area
.
