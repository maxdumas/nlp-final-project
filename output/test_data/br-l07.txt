He
put_in
a
call
to
Cunningham
from
his
hotel_room
.
The
maid
answered
and
he
decided
Nancy
must
be
at_work
.
Jeb
cautioned
him
not
to
be
too
hopeful
and_then
,
ignoring
his
own
advice
,
said
excitedly
,
``
But
it
does
sound
good
.
A
woman
named
Lisa
who
tells
nobody
anything
about
herself
.
That
courtyard
picture
with
the
same
initials
''
.
``
I
'm
not
exactly
jumping
up
and
down
with_enthusiasm
.
I
'll
call
you
in
a
day
or_so
''
.
On
the
highway
he
relaxed
and
enjoyed
the
drive
over
Lake_Pontchartrain
and
along
the
coast
.
Gulf_Springs
was
ten
miles
inland
-
more
of
a
quaint
old
coast
town
than
those
along
the
beach
made
garish
by
tourist
attractions
.
He
checked_into
a
motel
and
drove
downtown
.
The
courthouse
was
a
white-stucco
building
minus
the
customary
dome
.
Instead
of
the
usual
straggling
privet
hedges
and
patches
of
bare
dirt
in
most
small-town
squares
,
the
building
was
hemmed_in
by
a
semitropical
growth
of
camellias
and
azaleas
and
a
smooth
lawn
the
improbably
bright-green
shade
of
florist
's
grass
.
He
figured
his
best
bet
was
a
call
on
the
sheriff
.
A
clerk
in
the
outer
office
took
him
in
to
Sheriff_Carruthers
,
a
big
,
paunchy
man
with
thick
,
white
hair
and
a
voice
with
a
senatorial
resonance
which
suggested
he
should
be
running
for
higher
office
.
Seated
in_front
of
the
desk
,
Hank
said
,
``
I
'm
looking_for
some
information
with
very
little
to
go_on
,
Sheriff
''
.
He
explained
the
background
of
the
case
,
ending
with
the
tenuous
clue
which
had
brought
him
to
Gulf_Springs
.
The
sheriff
's
swivel_chair
tilted
back
.
``
So
you
're
looking_for
a
woman
who
married
a
man
who
might
have
lived
here
a
year
ago
and
might
have
been
poisoned
.
If
there
was
such
a
person
,
I
'm
afraid
she
got_away
with_it
.
Pity
we
do
n't
know
more
about
him
.
I
think
the
best
bet
is
to
go_through
the
society
columns
of
last
year
and
see
if
any
of
the
grooms
match
with
the
obituaries
a_little
later
.
It
'll
be
a
tedious
job
,
but
if
you
want
to
try
it
,
the
old
newspaper
files
are
in
the
basement
here
in
the
county
supervisor
's
office
''
.
``
Maybe
the
society
editor
would
remember
a
good-looking
out-of-town
bride
''
.
``
That
's
an
idea
.
Mrs._Calhoun
has
been
society
editor
here
for
twenty-five
years
.
The
editor
says
that
marriages
may
be
made
in
heaven
,
but
weddings
are
made
in
Mrs._Calhoun
's
columns
.
She
's
the
one
who
decides
which
wedding
is
to
get
the
lead
space
in
the
Sunday
paper
and
all
that
''
.
He
smiled
.
``
Once
,
when
the
editor
was
just
out
of
the
hospital
from
a
gallstone
operation
,
Mrs._Calhoun
and
the
mother
of
the
bride
went_out
to
his
house
and
fought
it
out
beside
his
bed
.
She
'd
be
sure
to
remember
any
bride
who
was
vague
about
background
.
She
'd
have
made
a
great
scientist
dedicated_to
tracking_down
heredity
and
environment
.
She
'd
also
remember
if
the
groom
died
later
''
.
He
stood_up
.
``
I
wish
you
good_luck
,
but
please
do
n't
dig_up
too
tough
a
case
for
me
this
close_to
election
.
If
you
find_out
anything
,
come
on
back
here
and
we
'll
get_started
on_it
''
.
Tracking_down
Mrs._Calhoun
was
like
trying
to
catch_up_with
Paul_Revere
between
Lexington
and
Concord
.
It
turned_out
that
she
also
sold
real_estate
,
cosmetics
,
and
hospital
insurance
.
The
wearying
trek
stretched
into
the
afternoon
-
from
newspaper
plant
to
insurance
office
to
her
house
and
back
to
the
newspaper
,
where
he
found
her
at
five
o
'
clock
.
She
was
a
large
woman
with
a
frizzled
gray
poodle
cut
and
a
pencil
clamped
like
a_bit
between
her
teeth
while
she
hunted
and
pecked
on
an
old
typewriter
.
It
took
a_couple_of
minutes
to
run_through
her
various
businesses
and
get
down
to
the
one
he
wanted
.
``
Last
year
?
Well
,
I
do
remember
one
.
From
Baton_Rouge
.
Married
a
man
named
Vincent_Black
.
I
remember
her
because
she
did
n't
want
her
picture
in
the
paper
.
First
bride
like
that
I
've
seen
in
twenty-five
years
''
.
``
What
reason
did
she
give
''
?
``
Said
she
had
a
breaking-out
on
her
face
-
some
sort_of
allergy
-
and
none
of
her
old
pictures
was
good
enough
.
I
did
n't
see
her
till
several
days
later
at
the
wedding
,
and
her
face
looked
like
it
had
never
had
a
blemish
on_it
.
But
,
of_course
,
you
could
n't
see
too
well
through
the
veil
''
.
``
Was
her
name
Lisa_Carmody
''
?
``
Now
how
in
hell
would
I
remember
that
''
?
``
Never_mind
.
I
can
look
it
up
.
Do
they
still
live
here
''
?
``
I
think
they
moved
away
shortly
after
they
were
married
.
He
was
a
salesman
for
something
or
other
and
must
have
been
transferred
.
I
'm
sure
it
'll
be
in
the
files
.
We
usually
run
a
social
note
when
somebody
moves
away
''
.
He
stood_up
and
thanked
her
.
``
Have
they
inherited
some
money
or
something
''
?
she
asked
with
a
reportorial
gleam
in
her
eye
.
He
said
vaguely
,
``
Well
,
it
is
a_little
legal
matter
,
but
nothing
like
that
''
.
He
hurried
across
to
the
courthouse
and
caught
the
sheriff
just_as
he
was
leaving
.
``
Sounds
like
what
you
're
after
''
,
he
said
when
Hank
had
finished
.
``
Come_on
,
let
's
hurry
down
before
they
lock_up
for
the
day
''
.
In
the
basement
the
sheriff
took
him
to
a
small
,
dingy
office
occupied
by
a
tall
,
thin
man
informal
in
rolled-up
shirt
sleeves
.
``
Mr.
Ferrell
&
&
&
Hirey_Lindsay
,
chairman_of_the_board
of
supervisors
.
Mr._Ferrell
is
a
private_detective
,
Hirey
.
Wants
to
look_up
something
in
the
newspaper
files
,
so
do
n't
lock
him
in
here
''
.
``
Sure
''
,
said
Hirey
.
``
I
'll
just
leave
the
door
open
.
It
latches
when
you
close
it
,
so
stay
as
long
as
you
like
''
.
Carruthers
crossed
the
room
to
a
metal
door
with
an
open
grillework
in
the
top
half
.
He
pulled
it
open
.
``
Now
do
n't
shut
this
door
.
It
won't
open
from
inside
.
Before
we
built
the
new
jail
,
we
used_to
keep
prisoners
in
here
overnight
sometimes
when
the
old
jail
got
too
crowded
.
Hirey
treats
himself
a_lot
better
than
we
do
prisoners
.
They
were
a
sight
more
comfortable
than
the
ones
in
the
jail
with
the
cold
air
from
Hirey
's
air
conditioner
coming_through
the
grille
''
.
He
walked
past
the
sheriff
into
a
windowless
room
with
shelves
full_of
big
,
leather-bound
volumes
from
floor
to
ceiling
all_around
the
walls
.
A
metal
table
and
four
chairs
stood
in
the
center
.
``
They
're
all
here
,
back
to
1865
''
,
Carruthers
told
him
.
``
It
's
all_right
to
smoke
,
but
make
sure
your
cigarettes
are
out
before
you
leave
.
And
,
of_course
,
you
know
not
to
take
clippings
''
.
``
I
'll
leave
the
air
conditioner
on
for
you
,
Mr._Ferrell
''
,
said
Hirey
.
``
Do
n't
forget
to
turn
it
off
and
close
the
door
good
so
it
'll
latch
''
.
Hank
thanked
them
and
promised
to
observe
the
rules
.
When
they
had
gone
,
he
stood
for
a
minute
breathing_in
the
mustiness
of
old
paper
and
leather
which
the
busily
thrumming
air
conditioner
could
n't
quite
dispel
.
In
a
tour
around
the
stacks
,
he
found
that
the
earliest
volumes
began
on_the_left
and
progressed
clockwise
around
the
room
.
An
old
weakness
for
burrowing
in
records
rose_up
to
tempt
him
.
It
was
,
indeed
,
all
here
-
almost
a
century
.
From
reconstruction
to
moon
rockets
.
But
he
pulled_away
from
the
irrelevant
old
volumes
and
walked
around
to
the
newer
ones
.
Last
year
's
volume
was
at
the
top
a_couple_of
inches
below
the
ceiling
.
Near
it
was
a
metal
ladder
on
casters
attached
to
the
top
shelf
.
He
pulled
it
over
,
climbed_up
,
and
lifted_out
the
big
volume
,
almost
losing
his
balance
from
the
weight
of_it
.
He
staggered
over
and
dropped
it
on
the
table
.
Since
Mrs._Calhoun
remembered
only
that
the
marriage
had
been
in
the
spring
,
he
started
to
plod
through
several
months
.
He
tried
to
turn
right
to
the
society
page
in
each
one
,
but
interesting
stories
kept
cropping_up
to
distract
him
.
At_last
he
found
it
in
the
paper
of
April
2
.
It
told
him
little
more_than
Mrs._Calhoun
had
remembered
,
stating
that
it
had
been
a
small
,
modest
wedding
compared
to
some
of
the
others
.
There
was
a
marked
contrast
in
the
amount
of
information
on
bride
and
groom
.
Mr._Black
's
life
was
an
open
book
,
so_to_speak
,
from
his
birth
in
Jackson
,
Mississippi
,
through
his
basketball-playing
days
at
L._S._U.
and
his
attainment
of
a
B._A.
degree
,
which
had
presumably
prepared
him
for
his
career
as
district
sales
manager
for
Peerless_Business
Machines
.
The
one
line
on
the
bride
said
she
was
Miss_Lisa_Carmody
from
Baton_Rouge
.
No
mention
of
New_Orleans
.
Hank
was
beginning
to
feel
sharp
concern
for
Mr._Black
.
If
Mrs._Black
was
who
he
thought
she
was
,
Mr._Black
's
Peerless
selling
days
might
well
be
over
.
Now
for
their
exodus
from
Gulf_Springs
.
This
time
the
search
took
twice_as
long
,
cutting_down
on
his
extra
reading
,
for
he
had
to
pick
through
several
columns
of
one
-
and
two-line
social
notes
in
each
issue
.
He
found
it
in
the
edition
of
May
15
.
The
item
said
Mr.
and
Mrs._Black
had
moved
to
Jackson
,
his
home
town
-
so
the
lovely
Lisa
had
been
with
him
a
year
ago
.
Next
on
his
program
was
a
call
to
the
Jackson
office
of
Peerless_Business
Machines
to
find_out
if
Vincent_Black
was
still
with
them
-
or
,
more
specifically
,
still
with
us
.
He
glanced
at
his
watch
,
saw
it
was
only
seven
,
and
decided
to
indulge
his
weakness
now
.
For
the
next
hour
he
scrambled
happily
up_and_down
the
ladder
,
sharing
the
excitement
of
reporters
who
had
seen
McKinley
's
assassination
,
the
Iroquois_Theater
fire
in
Chicago
,
and
the
Hall-Mills
trial
.
In_the_middle
of
the
stock_market
crash
,
he
heard
a
slight
noise
in
the
outer
office
.
He
turned_around
,
saw
nothing
,
and
decided
it
must
be
a
mouse
.
Something
else
distracted
him
,
yet
there
was
no
sound
,
only
tomblike
silence
.
Then
he
knew
it
was
not
sound
,
but
lack
of_it
.
The
air
conditioner
was
no_longer
running
.
He
jumped
up
and
turned_around
to
see
the
metal
door
closing
.
It
clanged
shut
as
he
sprang
toward
it
.
He
pressed
his
face
against
the
grille
.
``
Who
's
there
''
?
The
light
shining
through
the
grille
dimly
illumined
the
office
beyond
-
enough
for
him
to
see
there
was
no
one
there
.
Then
he
heard
the
outer
door
closing
.
``
Hey
,
come_back
''
,
he
shouted
.
He
thought
it
must
be
some
damn
janitor
or
cleaning_woman
puttering_around
,
figuring
that
Hirey
had
gone
off
and
forgotten
to
turn_off
everything
and
lock_up
.
Then
the
faint
beginnings
of
fear
stirred
in
his
mind
.
Unless
he
was
stone-blind
,
the
person
who
'd
just
left
could
n't
have
missed
seeing
Hank
through
the
open_door
of
the
brightly
lighted
room
.
And
even
if
he
'd
somehow
missed
seeing
him
,
he
would
n't
have
gone
off
and
left
the
light
on
and
door
open
in
the
file
room
.
Whoever
it
was
had
meant
to
shut
him
up
in
here
,
had
followed
him
and
waited
till
the
courthouse
and
square
were
deserted
.
But
why
?
To
search
his
room
at
the
motel
?
To
come_back
later
and
kill
him
after
the
stores
had
closed
around
the
square
and
everybody
had
left
?
No
,
they
could
kill
him
just_as
easy
right_now
.
Nobody
could
hear
what
was
going_on
in_this
underground
vault
.
Then
he
heard
it
and
smelled
it
-
the
steady
hissing
,
the
dread
,
familiar
pungency
of
gas
escaping
.
It
must
be
coming
from
an
upright
heater
against
the
far
wall
in
the
supervisors
'
office
.
Until_now
,
Lilac_Gaylor
and
Lila_Kingsley
had
been
like
an
anagram
which
he
could
unscramble
at
his
own
pace
and
choosing
.
Except
for
those
minutes
in
her
room
,
he
had
lost
touch
with
her
as
a
reality
.
Gaylor
's
obsession
and
Cunningham
's
chimera-chasing
reminiscences
had
mesmerized
him
into
thinking_of
Lila
and
Lilac
,
separately
or
together
,
as
a
legend
.
They
kept
drifting
apart
and
merging
again
in
his
mind
like
some
minute
form
of
life
on
a
microscope
slide
.
