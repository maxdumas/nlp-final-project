George_Kennan
's
account
of
relations
between
Russia
and
the
West
from
the
fall
of
Tsarism
to
the
end
of
World_War
2
,
is
the
finest
piece
of
diplomatic
history
that
has
appeared
in
many
years
.
It
combines
qualities
that
are
seldom
found
in
one
work
:
Scrupulous
scholarship
,
a
fund
of
personal
experience
,
a
sense
of
drama
and
characterization
and
a
broad
grasp
of
the
era
's
great
historical
issues
.
In_short
,
the
book
,
based
largely
on
lectures
delivered
at
Harvard_University
,
is
both
reliable
and
readable
;
the
author
possesses
an
uncommonly
fine
English
style
,
and
he
is
dealing
with
subjects
of
vast
importance
that
are
highly
topical
for
our
time
.
If
Mr._Kennan
is
sometimes
a_little
somber
in
his
appraisals
,
if
his
analysis
of
how
Western
diplomacy
met
the
challenge
of
an
era
of
great_wars
and
social
revolutions
is
often
critical
and
pessimistic
-
well
,
the
record
itself
is
not
too
encouraging
.
Mr._Kennan
takes
careful
account
of
every
mitigating
circumstance
in
recalling
the
historical
atmosphere
in_which
mistaken
decisions
were
taken
.
But
he
rejects
,
perhaps
a_little
too
sweepingly
,
the
theory
that
disloyal
and
pro-Communist
influences
may
have
contributed
to
the
policy
of
appeasing
Stalin
which
persisted
until
after
the
end
of
the
war
and
reached
its
high
point
at
the
Yalta_Conference
in
February
,
1945
.
After_all
,
Alger_Hiss
,
subsequently
convicted
of
perjury
in
denying
that
he
gave
secret
State_Department
documents
to
Soviet
agents
,
was
at
Yalta
.
And
Harry_Dexter_White
,
implicated
in
F._B._I.
reports
in
Communist
associations
,
was
one
of
the
architects
of
the
Morgenthau_Plan
,
which
had
it
ever
been
put
into
full
operation
,
would
have
simply
handed
Germany
to
Stalin
.
One
item
in_this
unhappy
scheme
was
to
have
Germany
policed
exclusively
by
its
continental
neighbors
,
among
whom
only
the
Soviet_Union
possessed
real
military
strength
.
It
is
quite
probable
,
however
,
that
stupidity
,
inexperience
and
childish
adherence
to
slogans
like
``
unconditional
surrender
''
had
more
to
do
with
the
unsatisfactory
settlements
at
the
end
of
the
war
than
treason
or
sympathy
with
Communism
.
Mr._Kennan
sums_up
his
judgment
of_what
went_wrong
this
way
.
``
You
see
,
first_of_all
and
in_a_sense
as
the
source
of
all
other
ills
,
the
unshakeable
American
commitment
to
the
principle
of
unconditional
surrender
:
The
tendency
to
view
any
war
in_which
we
might
be
involved
not
as
a
means
of
achieving
limited
objectives
in
the
way
of
changes
in
a
given
status_quo
,
but
as
a
struggle
to
the
death
between
total
virtue
and
total
evil
,
with
the
result
that
the
war
had
absolutely
to
be
fought
to
the
complete
destruction
of
the
enemy
's
power
,
no_matter
what
disadvantages
or
complications
this
might
involve
for
the
more
distant
future
''
.
Recognizing
that
there
could
have
been
no
effective
negotiated
peace
with
Hitler
,
he
points_out
the
shocking
failure
to
give
support
to
the
anti-Nazi
underground
,
which
very_nearly
eliminated
Hitler
in
1944
.
A
veteran
diplomat
with
an
extraordinary
knowledge
of
Russian
language
,
history
and
literature
,
Kennan
recalls
how
,
at_the_time
of
Hitler
's
attack
on
the
Soviet_Union
in
1941
,
he
penned
a
private
note
to
a
State_Department
official
,
expressing
the
hope
that
``
never
would
we
associate
ourselves
with
Russian
purposes
in
the
areas
of
eastern
Europe
beyond
her
own
boundaries
''
.
The
hope
was
vain
.
With
justified
bitterness
the
author
speaks
of
``
what
seems
to
me
to
have
been
an
inexcusable
body
of
ignorance
about
the
nature
of
the
Russian_Communist
movement
,
about
the
history
of
its
diplomacy
,
about
what
had
happened
in
the
purges
,
and
about
what
had
been
going_on
in
Poland
and
the
Baltic_States
''
.
He
also
speaks
of
Franklin_D._Roosevelt
's
``
puerile
''
assumption
that
``
if
only
he
(
Stalin
)
could
be
exposed
to
the
persuasive
charm
of
someone
like
F._D._R.
himself
,
ideological
preconceptions
would
melt
and
Russia
's
co-operation
with
the
West
could
be
easily
arranged
''
.
No
wonder
Khrushchev
's
first
message
to
President_Kennedy
was
a
wistful
desire
for
the
return
of
the
``
good
old
days
''
of
Roosevelt
.
This
fascinating
story
begins
with
a
sketch
,
rich_in
personal
detail
,
of
the
glancing
mutual
impact
of
World_War
1
,
and
the
two
instalments
of
the
Russian_Revolution
.
The
first
of
these
involved
the
replacement
of
the
Tsar
by
a
liberal
Provisional_Government
in
March
,
1917
;
the
second
,
the
seizure
of
power
by
the
Bolsheviks
(
who
later
called
themselves
Communists
)
in
November
of
the
same
year
.
As
Kennan
shows
,
the
judgment
of
the
Allied
governments
about
what
was
happening
in
Russia
was
warped
by
the
obsession
of
defeating
Germany
.
They
were
blind_to
the
evidence
that
nothing
could
keep
the
Russian
people
fighting
.
They
attributed
everything
that
went_wrong
in
Russia
to
German
influence
and
intrigue
.
This
,
more_than
any
other
factor
,
led
to
the
fiasco
of
Allied
intervention
.
As
the
author
very
justly
says
:
``
Had
a
world_war
not
been
in_progress
,
there
would
never
,
under
any
conceivable
stretch
of
the
imagination
,
have
been
an
Allied
intervention
in
North_Russia
''
.
The
scope
and
significance
of_this
intervention
have
been
grossly
exaggerated
by
Communist
propaganda
;
here
Kennan
,
operating
with
precise
facts
and
figures
,
performs
an
excellent
job
of
debunking
.
Of
many
passages
in
the
book
that
exemplify
the
author
's
vivid
style
,
the
characterizations
of
the
two
plebeian
dictators
whose
crimes
make
those
of
crowned
autocrats
pale
by
comparison
may
be
selected
.
On
Stalin
:
``
This
was
a
man
of
incredible
criminality
,
of
a
criminality
effectively
without
limits
;
a
man
apparently
foreign
to
the
very
experience
of
love
,
without
mercy
or
pity
;
a
man
in
whose
entourage
none
was
ever
safe
;
a
man
whose
hand
was
set
against
all
that
could
not
be
useful
to
him
at
the
moment
;
a
man
who
was
most
dangerous
of
all
to
those
who
were
his
closest
collaborators
in
crime
''
.
And
here
is
Kennan
's
image
of
Hitler
,
Stalin
's
temporary
collaborator
in
the
subjugation
and
oppression
of
weaker
peoples
,
and
his
later
enemy
:
``
Behind
that
Charlie_Chaplin
moustache
and
that
truant
lock
of
hair
that
always
covered
his
forehead
,
behind
the
tirades
and
the
sulky
silences
,
the
passionate
orations
and
the
occasional
dull
evasive
stare
,
behind
the
prejudices
,
the
cynicism
,
the
total
amorality
of
behavior
,
behind
even
the
tendency
to
great
strategic
mistakes
,
there
lay
a
statesman
of
no
mean
qualities
:
Shrewd
,
calculating
,
in
many
ways
realistic
,
endowed
-
like
Stalin
-
with
considerable
powers
of
dissimulation
,
capable_of
playing
his
cards
very
close_to
his
chest
when
he
so
desired
,
yet
bold
and
resolute
in
his
decisions
,
and
possessing
one
gift
Stalin
did
not
possess
:
The
ability
to
rouse
men
to
fever
pitch
of
personal
devotion
and
enthusiasm
by
the
power
of
the
spoken_word
''
.
Two
criticisms
of_this
generally
admirable
and
fascinating
book
involve
the
treatment
of
wartime
diplomacy
which
is
jagged
at
the
edges
-
there
is
no
mention
of
the
Potsdam_Conference
or
the
Morgenthau_Plan
.
And
in
a
concluding
chapter
about
America
's
stance
in
the
contemporary_world
,
one
senses
certain
misplacements
of
emphasis
and
a
failure
to
come_to_grips
with
the
baffling
riddle
of
our
time
:
How
to
deal
with
a
wily
and
aggressive
enemy
without
appeasement
and
without
war
.
But
one
should
not
ask
for
everything
.
Mr._Kennan
,
who
has
recently
abandoned
authorship
for
a
new
round
of
diplomacy
as
the
recently
appointed
American
ambassador
to
Yugoslavia
,
is
not
the
only
man
who
finds
it
easier
to
portray
the
past
than
to
prescribe
for
the
future
.
The
story
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
of
Soviet-Western
relations
is
vitally
important
,
and
it
is
told
with
the
fire
of
a
first-rate
historical
narrator
.
The
Ireland
we
usually
hear
about
in
the
theater
is
a
place
of
bitter
political
or
domestic
unrest
,
lightened
occasionally
with
flashes
of
native
wit
and
charm
.
In
``
Donnybrook
''
,
there
is
quite
a
different
Eire
,
a
rural
land
where
singing
,
dancing
,
fist-fighting
and
romancing
are
the
thing
.
There
is
plenty
of
violence
,
to_be_sure
,
but
it
is
a
nice
violence
and
no
one
gets
killed
.
By_and_large
,
Robert_McEnroe
's
adaptation
of
Maurice_Walsh
's
film
,
``
The
Quiet
Man
''
,
provides
the
entertainment
it
set_out
to
,
and
we
have
a
lively
musical
show
if_not
a
superlative
one
.
This
is
the
tale
of
one
John_Enright
,
an
American
who
has
accidentally
killed
a
man
in
the
prize_ring
and
is
now
trying
to
forget
about
it
in
a
quiet
place
where
he
may
become
a
quiet
man
.
But
Innesfree
,
where
Ellen_Roe_Danaher
and
her
bullying
brother
,
Will
,
live
,
is
no
place
for
a
man
who
will
not
use
his
fists
.
So
Enright
's
courting
of
the
mettlesome
Ellen
is
impeded
considerably
,
thereby
providing
the
tale
which
is
told
.
You
may
be
sure
he
marries
her
in_the_end
and
has
a
fine
old
knockdown
fight
with
the
brother
,
and
that
there
are
plenty
of
minor
scraps
along
the
way
to
ensure
that
you
understand
what
the
word
Donnybrook
means
.
Then
there
is
a
matchmaker
,
one
Mikeen_Flynn
,
a
role
for
which
Eddie_Foy
was
happily
selected
.
Now
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
a
matchmaker
in
Ireland
should
happen
also
to
be
a
talented
soft-shoe
dancer
and
gifted
improviser
of
movements
of
the
limbs
,
torso
and
neck
,
except
that
these
talents
add
immensely
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
play
.
Mr._Foy
is
a
joy
,
having
learned
his
dancing
by
practicing
it
until
he
is
practically
perfect
.
His
matchmaking
is
,
naturally
,
incidental
,
and
it
only
serves
Flynn
right
when
a
determined
widow
takes
him
by
the
ear
and
leads
him
off
to
matrimony
.
Art_Lund
,
a
fine
big
actor
with
a
great
head
of
blond
hair
and
a
good
voice
,
impersonates
Enright
.
Although
he
is
not
graced
with
the
subtleties
of
romantic
technique
,
that
's
not
what
an
ex-prize
fighter
is
supposed
to
have
,
anyway
.
Joan_Fagan
,
a
fiery
redhead
who
can
impress
you
that
she
has
a
temper
whether
she
really
has
one
or
not
,
plays
Ellen
,
and
sings
the
role
very_well
,
too
.
If
the
mettle
which
Ellen
exhibits
has
a_bit
of
theatrical
dross
in
it
,
never
mind
;
she
fits
into
the
general
scheme
well
enough
.
Susan_Johnson
,
as
the
widow
,
spends
the
first_half
of
the
play
running
a
bar
and
singing
about
the
unlamented
death
of
her
late
husband
and
the
second_half
trying
to
acquire
a
new
one
.
She
has
a
good
,
firm
delivery
of
songs
and
adds
to
the
solid
virtues
of
the
evening
.
Then
there
are
a
pair
of
old
biddies
played
by
Grace_Carney
and
Sibly_Bowan
who
may
be
right
off
the
shelf
of
stock
Irish
characters
,
but
they
put
such
a
combination
of
good_will
and
malevolence
into
their
parts
that
they
're
quite
entertaining
.
And
in
the
role
of
Will
Danaher
,
Philip_Bosco
roars
and
sneers
sufficiently
to
intimidate
not_only
one
American
but
the
whole
British
army
,
if
he
chose
.
``
Donnybrook
''
is
no
``
Brigadoon
''
,
but
it
does
have
some
very
nice
romantic
background
touches
and
some
excellent
dancing
.
The
ballads
are
sweet
and
sad
,
and
the
music
generally
competent
.
It
sometimes
threatens
to
linger
in
the
memory
after
the
final
curtain
,
and
some
of_it
,
such_as
the
catchy
``
Sez
I
''
,
does
.
``
A
Toast
To
The
Bride
''
,
sung
by
Clarence_Nordstrom
,
playing
a
character
called
Old_Man
Toomey
,
is
quite
simple
,
direct
and
touching
.
The
men
of
Innesfree
are
got_up
authentically
in
cloth_caps
and
sweaters
,
and
their
dancing
and
singing
is
fine
.
So
is
that
of
the
limber
company
of
lasses
who
whirl
and
glide
and
quickstep
under
Jack_Cole
's
expert
choreographic
direction
.
The
male
dancers
sometimes
wear
kilts
and
their
performance
in
them
is
spirited
and
stimulating
.
Rouben_Ter-Arutunian
,
in
his
stage_settings
,
often
uses
the
scrim
curtain
behind
which
Mr._Cole
has
placed
couples
or
groups
who
sing
and
set
the
mood
for
the
scenes
which
are
to
follow
.
There
is
no
reason
why
most
theatergoers
should
not
have
a
pretty
good
time
at
``
Donnybrook
''
,
unless
they
are
permanently
in
the
mood
of
Enright
when
he
sings
about
how
easily
he
could
hate
the
lovable
Irish
.
We
can
all
breathe
more
easily
this
morning
-
more
easily
and
joyously
,
too
-
because
Joshua_Logan
has
turned
the
stage
show
,
``
Fanny
''
,
into
a
delightful
and
heart-warming
film
.
The
task
of
taking
the
raw_material
of
Marcel_Pagnol
's
original
trio
of
French
films
about
people
of
the
waterfront
in
Marseilles
and
putting
them
again
on
the
screen
,
after
their
passage
through
the
Broadway
musical
idiom
,
was
a
delicate
and
perilous
one
,
indeed
.
More_than
the
fans
of
Pagnol
's
old
films
and
of
their
heroic
star
,
the
great
Raimu
,
were
looking
askance
at
the
project
.
The
fans
of
the
musical
were
,
too
.
But
now
the
task
is
completed
and
the
uncertainty
resolved
with
the
opening
of
the
English-dialogue
picture
at
the
Music_Hall
yesterday
.
Whether
fan
of
the
Pagnol
films
or
stage
show
,
whether
partial_to
music
or
no
,
you
can
n't
help
but
derive
joy
from
this
picture
if
you
have
a
sense_of_humor
and
a
heart
.
