The
Orioles
tonight
retained
the
distinction
of
being
the
only
winless
team
among
the
eighteen
Major-League_clubs
as
they
dropped
their
sixth
straight
spring
exhibition
decision
,
this
one
to
the
Kansas_City
Athletics
by
a
score
of
5
to
3
.
Indications
as_late_as
the
top
of
the
sixth
were
that
the
Birds
were
to
end
their
victory
drought
as
they
coasted
along
with
a
3
-
to-o
advantage
.
Over
the
first
five
frames
,
Jack_Fisher
,
the
big
righthander
who
figures
to
be
in_the_middle
of
Oriole
plans
for
a
drive
on
the
1961
American_League
pennant
,
held
the
A
's
scoreless
while
yielding
three
scattered
hits
.
Then
Dick_Hyde
,
submarine_ball
hurler
,
entered
the
contest
and
only
five
batters
needed
to
face
him
before
there
existed
a
3
-
to
3
deadlock
.
A
two
run
homer
by
Norm_Siebern
and
a
solo_blast
by
Bill_Tuttle
tied
the
game
,
and
single
runs
in
the
eighth
and
ninth
gave
the
Athletics
their
fifth
victory
in
eight
starts
.
With
one
down
in
the
eighth
,
Marv_Throneberry
drew
a
walk
and
stole
second
as
Hyde
fanned
Tuttle
.
Catcher
Frank_House
's
throw
in
an
effort
to
nab
Throneberry
was
wide
and
in
the
dirt
.
Then
Heywood_Sullivan
,
Kansas_City
catcher
,
singled
up
the
middle
and
Throneberry
was
across
with
what
proved
to
be
the
winning
run
.
Rookie
southpaw
George_Stepanovich
relieved
Hyde
at_the_start
of
the
ninth
and
gave_up
the
A
's
fifth
tally
on
a
walk
to
second_baseman
Dick_Howser
,
a
wild_pitch
,
and
Frank_Cipriani
's
single
under
Shortstop
Jerry_Adair
's
glove
into
center
.
The
Orioles
once_again
performed
at
the
plate
in
powderpuff
fashion
,
gathering
only
seven
blows
off
the
offerings
of
three
Kansas_City
pitchers
.
Three
were
doubles
,
Brooks_Robinson
getting
a
pair
and
Marv_Breeding
one
.
Bill_Kunkel
,
Bob_Hartman
and
Ed_Keegan
did
the
mound
chores
for
the
club
down
from
West_Palm_Beach
to
play
the
game
before
767
paying
customers
in
Miami_Stadium
.
The
Birds
got
five
hits
and
all
three
of
their
runs
off
Kunkel
before
Hartman
took_over
in
the
top
of
the
fourth
.
Hartman
,
purchased
by
the
A
's
from
the
Milwaukee_Braves
last
fall
,
allowed
no
hits
in
his
scoreless
three
inning
appearance
,
and
merited
the
triumph
.
Keegan
,
a
6
-
foot
-
3
-
inch
158
-
pounder
,
gave_up
the
Orioles
'
last
two
safeties
over
the
final
three
frames
,
escaping
a
load
of
trouble
in
the
ninth
when
the
Birds
threatened
but
failed
to
tally
.
In
the
ninth
,
Robinson
led
off
with
his
second
double
of
the
night
,
a
blast
off
the
fence
375
feet
deep
into
left
.
Whitey_Herzog
,
performing
in
right
as
the
Orioles
fielded
possibly
their
strongest
team
of
the
spring
,
worked
Keegan
for
a
base_on_balls
.
Then
three
consecutive
pinch_hitters
failed
to
produce
.
Pete_Ward
was
sent
in_for
House
and
,
after
failing
in
a
bunt
attempt
,
popped
to
Howser
on
the
grass
back
of
short
.
John_Powell
,
batting
for
Adair
,
fanned
after
fouling
off
two
2
-
and
2
pitches
,
and
Buddy_Barker
,
up
for
Stepanovich
,
bounced_out
sharply
to
Jerry_Lumpe
at
second
to
end
the
2
-
hour
and
-
27
-
minute
contest
.
The
Orioles
got
a
run
in
the
first
inning
when
Breeding
,
along
with
Robinson
,
the
two
Birds
who
got
a
pair
of
hits
,
doubled
to
right
center
,
moved
to
third
on
Russ_Snyder
's
single
to
right
and
crossed
on
Kunkel
's
wild_pitch
into
the
dirt
in_front
of
the
plate
.
The
Flock
added
a
pair
of
tallies
in
the
third
on
three
straight
hits
after
two
were
out
.
Jackie_Brandt
singled
deep
into
the
hole
at
short
to
start
the
rally
.
Jim_Gentile
bounced
a
hard
shot
off
Kunkel
's
glove
and
beat
it
out
for
a
single
,
and
when
Lumpe
grabbed
the
ball
and
threw
it
over
first_baseman
Throneberry
's
head
Brandt
took
third
and
Gentile
second
on
the
error
.
Then
Robinson
slammed
a
long
double
to
left
center
to
score
both
runners
.
When
Robinson
tried
to
stretch
his
blow
into
a
triple
,
he
was
cut_down
in
a
close
play
at
third
,
Tuttle
to
Andy_Carey
.
The
detailed
rundown
on
the
Kansas_City
scoring
in
the
sixth
went
like
this
:
Lumpe
worked
a
walk
as
the
first
batter
to
face
Hyde
and
romped
around
as
Siebern
blasted
Hyde
's
next
toss
415
feet
over
the
scoreboard
in
right
center
.
Carey
singled
on
a
slow
bouncing
ball
to
short
which
Robinson
cut_across
to
field
and
threw
wide
to
first
.
It
was
ruled
a
difficult
chance
and
a
hit
.
Then
Throneberry
rapped
into
a
fast
double_play
.
Breeding
to
Adair
to
Gentile
,
setting_up
Tuttle
's
390
-
foot
homer
over
the
wall
in
left
center
.
If
the
Orioles
are
to
break
their
losing_streak
within
the
next
two
days
,
it
will
have
to
be
at_the_expense_of
the
American_League
champion
New_York
Yankees
,
who
come
in
here
tomorrow
for
a
night_game
and
a
single
test
Sunday
afternoon
.
The
flavor
of
Baltimore
's
Florida_Grapefruit_League
news
ripened
considerably
late
today
when
the
Orioles
were
advised
that
Ron_Hansen
has
fulfilled
his
obligations
under
the
Army
's
military
training_program
and
is
ready
for
belated
spring_training
.
Hansen

He

before

When
he
was
inducted
into
the
Army
at
Fort_Knox_,
Ky.
,
Hansen
's
weight
had
dropped
to
180
-
``
too
light
for
me
to
be
at
my
best
''
he
said
.
``
I
feel
good
physically
''
,
Hansen
added
,
``
but
I

I
'll

better

I'm

``
I
think
I
can
do
a
better
job
with

now
that
I
know
the

around

a_little

``
Take

Brooks_Robinson
greeted
Hansen
as
the
Bird

grabbed
a
bat
,
headed
for
the
plate
and
bounced
a
third
inning
two
run
double
off
the
left

wall
tonight
.
It
was
the
first
of
two

by
Robinson
,
who
was
in
a
mood
to
celebrate
.
Just
before

time
,
Robinson
's
pretty
wife
,
Connie
informed
him
that
an
addition
to
the
family
can
be
expected
late
next
summer
.
Unfortunately
,
Brooks

were
not
in
such
festive
mood
as
the

expired
before
the

of
