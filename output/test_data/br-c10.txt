Only
once
in
a
very
long
while
comes
a
book
that
gives
the
reader
a
magic
sense
of
sharing
a
rare
experience
.
``
Ring
of
Bright_Water
''
by
Gavin_Maxwell
is
just
that
-
a
haunting
,
warmly
personal
chronicle
of
a
man
,
an
otter
,
and
a
remote
cottage
in
the
Scottish_West_Highlands
.
``
He
has
married
me
with
a
ring
of
bright
water
''
,
begins
the
Kathleen_Raine
poem
from
which
Maxwell
takes
his
title
,
and
it
is
this
mystic
bond
between
the
human
and
natural
world
that
the
author
conveys
.
The
place
is
Camusfearna
,
the
site
of
a
long-vanished
sea-village
opposite
the
isle
of
Skye
.
It
is
a
land
of
long
fjords
,
few
people
,
a
single-lane
road
miles
away
-
and
of
wild
stags
,
Greylag_geese
,
wild
swans
,
dolphins
and
porpoises
playing
in
the
waters
.
How
Maxwell
recounts
his
first
coming
to
Camusfearna
,
his
furnishing
the
empty
house
with
beach-drift
,
the
subtle
changes
in
season
over
ten
years
,
is
a
moving
experience
.
Just
the
evocations
of
time
and
place
,
of
passionate
encounter
between
man
and
a
natural
world
which
today
seems
almost
lost
,
would
be
enough
.
But
it
is
n't
.
There
is
Mijbil
,
an
otter
who
travelled
with
Maxwell
-
and
gave
Maxwell
's
name
to
a
new
species
-
from
the
Tigris
marshes
to
his
London
flat
.
It
may
sound
extravagant
to
say
that
there
has
never
been
a
more
engaging
animal
in_all
literature
.
This
is
not_only
a
compliment
to
Mijbil
,
of
whom
there
are
a
fine
series
of
photographs
and
drawings
in
the
book
,
but
to
the
author
who
has
catalogued
the
saga
of
a
frightened
otter
cub
's
journey
by
plane
from
Iraq
to
London
,
then
by
train
(
where
he
lay
curled
in
the
wash
basin
playing
with
the
water
tap
)
to
Camusfearna
,
with
affectionate
detail
.
Mij
,
as
his
owner
was
soon
to
learn
,
had
strange
,
inexplicable
habits
.
He
liked
to
nip
ear
lobes
of
unsuspecting
visitors
with
his
needle-sharp
teeth
.
He
preferred
sleeping
in
bed
with
his
head
on
a
pillow
.
Systematically
he
would
open
and
ransack
drawers
.
Given
a
small
ball
or
marbles
,
he
would
invent
games
and
play
by
himself
for
hours
.
With
curiosity
and
elan
,
he
explored
every_inch
of
glen
,
beach
and
burn
,
once
stranding
himself
for
hours
on
a
ledge
high_up
a
sheer
seventy-foot
cliff
and
waiting
with
calm
faith
to
be
rescued
by
Maxwell
,
who
nearly
lost
his
life
in
doing
so
.
A
year
and
a
day
of_this
idyll
is
described
for
the
reader
,
one
in_which
not_only
discovery
of
a
new_world
of
personality
is
charted
,
but
self-discovery
as_well
.
In
the
solitude
of
Camusfearna
there
had
been
no
loneliness
.
``
To
be
quite
alone
where
there
are
no
other
human_beings
is
sharply
exhilarating
;
it
is
as
though
some
pressure
had
suddenly
been_lifted
,
allowing
an
intense
awareness
&
&
&
a
sharpening
of
the
senses
''
.
Now
,
with
the
increasing
interdependence
between
himself
and
Mij
came
a
knowledge
of
an
obscure
need
,
that
of
being
trusted
implicitly
by
some
creature
.
Two
other
people
in_time
shared
Mijbil
's
love
:
``
it
remained
around
us
three
that
his
orb
revolved
when
he
was
not
away
in
his
own
imponderable
world
of
wave
and
water
;
we
were
his
Trinity
,
and
he
behaved
towards
us
with
a
mixture
of
trust
and
abuse
,
passion
and
irritation
.
In_turn
each
of
us
in
our
own
way
depended
,
as
gods
do
,
upon
his
worship
''
.
Yet
the
idyll
ended
.
The
brief
details
of
Mijbil
's
death
lend
depth
to
the
story
,
give
it
an
edge
of
ironic
tragedy
.
Man
,
to
whom
Mij
gave
endless
affection
and
fealty
,
was
responsible
in
the
form
of
a
road
worker
with
a
pickaxe
who
somehow
becomes
an
abstract
symbol
of
the
savage
in
man
.
But
then
,
through
a
strange
coincidence
,
Maxwell
manages
to
acquire
Idal
,
a
female
otter
,
and
the
fascinating
story
starts
once_more
.
One
is
not
sure
who
emerges
as
the
main
personality
of_this
book
-
Mijbil
,
with
his
rollicking
ways
,
or
Maxwell
himself
,
poet
,
portrait_painter
,
writer
,
journalist
,
traveller
and
zoologist
,
sensitive
but
never
sentimental
recorder
of
an
unusual
way_of_life
,
in
a
language
at_once
lyrical
and
forceful
,
vivid
and
unabashed
.
This
reviewer
read
the
book
when
it
was
first
brought_out
in
England
with
a
sense
of
discovery
and
excitement
.
Now
Gavin_Maxwell
's
ring
of
bright
water
has
widened
to
enchant
the
world
.
The
performances
of
the
Comedie_Francaise
are
the_most
important
recent
events
in
the
New_York
theater
.
They
serve
to
contradict
a
popular
notion
that
the
Comedie
merely
repeats
,
as
accurately
as
possible
,
the
techniques
of
acting
the
classics
that
prevailed
in
the
17
th
century
.
On_the_contrary
,
the
old
plays
are
continually
being
reinterpreted
,
and
each
new
production
of
a
classic
has
only
a
brief
history
at
the
Comedie
.
Of_course
,
the
well-received
revivals
last
longer
than
the
others
,
and
that
further
reminds
us
that
the
Comedie
is
not
insensitive
to
criticism
.
The
directors
of
the
Comedie
do
not
respond
to
adverse
notices
in
as
docile
and
subservient
a
manner
as
the
Broadway
producers
who
,
in
two
instances
this
season
,
closed
their
plays
after
one
performance
.
But
they
are
aware_of
the
world
outside
,
they
court
public
approval
,
they
delight
in
full
houses
,
and
they
occasionally
dare
to
experiment
in
interpreting
a
dramatic
classic
.
In
France
,
novel
approaches
to
the
classic
French
plays
are
frequently
attempted
.
The
government
pays
a
subsidy
for
revival
of
the
classics
,
and
this
policy
attracts
experimenters
who
sometimes
put
Moliere
's
characters
in
modern
dress
and
often
achieve
interesting
results
.
So_far
as
I
know
,
the
Comedie
has
never
put
Moliere
's
people
in
the
costumes
of
the
20
th
century
,
but
they
do
reinterpret
plays
and
characters
.
Last
season
,
the
Comedie
's
two
principal
experiments
came
to
grief
,
and
,
in
consequence
,
we
can
expect
fairly
soon
to
see
still
newer
productions
of
Racine
's
``
Phedre
''
and
Moliere
's
``
School
for
Wives
''
.
The
new
``
Phedre
''
was
done
in
17
th
century
setting
,
instead
of
ancient_Greek
;
perhaps
that
is
the
Comedie
's
equivalent
for
thrusting
this
play
's
characters
into
our
own
time
.
The
speaking
of
the
lines
seemed
excessively
slow
and
stately
,
possibly
in
an
effort
to
capture
the
spirit
of
17
th
century
elegance
.
A_few
literary
men
defended
what
they
took_to_be
an
emphasis
on
the
poetry
at
the
expense
of
the
drama
,
but
the
response
was
mainly
hostile
and
quite
violent
.
The
new
``
School
for
Wives
''
was
interpreted
according
to
a
principle
that_is
becoming
increasingly
common
in
the
playing
of
classic
comedy
-
the
idea
of
turning
some
obviously
ludicrous
figure
into
a
tragic
character
.
Among
the
Moliere
specialists
of
some
years
ago
,
Louis_Jouvet
tried
to
humanize
some
of
the
clowns
,
while
Fernand_Ledoux
,
often
performing
at
the
Comedie
,
made
them
more
gross
than
Moliere
may
have
intended
.
Apparently
,
Jouvet
and
Ledoux
attempted
just
these
dissimilar
approaches
in
the
role
of
Arnolphe
in
``
The
School
for
Wives
''
.
I
say
``
apparently
''
although
I
saw
Jouvet
as
Arnolphe
when
he
visited
this
country
shortly
before
his
death
;
by
that
time
,
he
seemed
to
have
dropped
the
tragic
playing
of
the
last
moments
of
the
comedy
.
Arnolphe
,
it
will
be
recalled
,
is
a
man
of
mature
years
who
tries
to
preserve
the
innocence
of
his
youthful
wife-to-be
.
The
part
can
lend
itself
to
serious
treatment
;
one
influential
French
critic
remarked
:
``
Pity
for
Arnolphe
comes_with
age
''
.
Accordingly
,
at
the
Comedie
last
year
,
Jean_Meyer
played
a
sympathetic
Arnolphe
and
drew
criticism
for
turning
the
comedy
into
a
tragedy
.
But
the
stuff
of
tragedy
was
not
truly
present
and
the
play
became
only
comedy
acted
rather
slowly
.
Wisely
,
the
Comedie
has
brought
Moliere
's
``
Tartuffe
''
on
its
tour
and
has_left
``
The
School
for
Wives
''
at_home
.
Tartuffe
is
the
religious
hypocrite
who
courts
his
benefactor
's
wife
.
Jouvet
played
him
as
a
sincere
zealot
,
and
Ledoux
,
at
the
Comedie
,
made
him
a
gross
buffoon
,
or_so
the
historians
tell
us
.
Louis_Seigner
,
who
formerly
played
the
deluded
benefactor
opposite
Ledoux
,
is
the
Tartuffe
of
the
present
production
,
which
he
himself
directed
.
His
Tartuffe
observes
the
golden_mean
.
His
red
face
,
his
coarse
gestures
,
and
his
lustful
stares
bespeak
his
sensuality
.
But
his
heavenward
glances
and
his
pious
speeches
are
not
merely
perfunctory
;
of_course
,
they
do
not
reflect
sincerity
,
but
they
exhibit
a
concern
to
make
a
good
job
out
of
his
pious
impersonation
.
Occasionally
,
Seigner
draws
some
justly
deserved
laughs
by
his
quick
shifts
from
one
personality
to
another
.
The
whole
role
,
by_the_way
,
is
a
considerable
transformation
for
anyone
who
has
seen
Seigner
in
his
other
parts
.
His
normal
specialty
is
playing
the
good-natured
old_man
,
frequently
stupid
or
deluded
but
never
mean
or
sly
.
Here
,
he
is
,
quite
persuasively
,
the
very
embodiment
of
meanness
and
slyness
.
Seigner
is
the
dean
of
the
company
,
the
oldest
actor
in
point
of
continuous
service
.
In_that
function
,
he
helps
to
rebut
another
legend
about
the
Comedie
.
We
are
often
told
that
the
Comedie
has
,
unfortunately
,
life-contracts
with
old
actors
who
are
both
mediocre
and
lazy
,
drawing
their
pay
without
much
acting
but
probably
doing
real
service
to
the
Comedie
by
staying
off_the_stage
.
Seigner
,
however
,
is
a
fine
actor
and
probably
the
busiest
man
in
the
company
;
among
his
other
parts
are
the
leads
in
``
The
Bourgeois
Gentleman
''
and
``
The
Imaginary_Invalid
''
.
In
Moliere
's
farce
,
``
The
Tricks
of
Scapin
''
,
Robert_Hirsch
undertakes
another
of
the
great
roles
.
Here
some
innovation
is
attempted
.
To_begin_with
,
Scapin
is
a
trickster
in
the
old
tradition
of
the
clever
servant
who
plots
the
strategy
of
courtship
for
his
master
.
Hirsch
's
Scapin
is
healthy
,
cheerful
,
energetic
,
revelling
in
his
physical
agility
and
his
obvious
superiority
to
the
young
gentlemen
whom
he
serves
.
Hirsch
says
that
he
has
given
the
role
certain
qualities
he
has
observed
in
the
city
toughs
of
the
real_world
.
And
surely
his
Scapin
has
a
fresh
directness
,
a
no-nonsense
quality
that
seems
to
make
him
his
own
master
and
nobody
's
servant
.
Django_Reinhardt
,
the
ill-fated
gypsy
,
was
a
true
artist
,
one
who
demonstrated
conclusively
the
power
of
art
to
renew
itself
and
flow
into
many
channels
.
There
is
hardly_a
jazz
guitarist
in
the
business
today
who
does
n't
owe
something
to
Django
.
And
Django
owed
much
to
Louis_Armstrong
.
He
told
once
of
how
he
switched
his
style
of
playing
to
jazz
after
listening
to
two
old
Armstrong
records
he
bought
in
the
Flea_Market
in
Paris
.
It
was
the
first
jazz
he
had
heard
.
Django
,
who
was_born
Jean_Baptiste_Reinhardt
in
Belgium
and
who
died
in
1953
in
France
,
was
an
extraordinary
man
.
Most_of
the
fingers
on
his
left_hand
were
burned_off
when
he
fell_asleep
with
a
cigarette
.
And
this
was
before
he
began
to
play
his
startlingly
beautiful
jazz
.
You
can
catch_up_with
him
-
if
you
have
n't
already
-
on
RCA-Victor
's
album
.
``
Djangology
''
,
made_up
of
tracks
he
recorded
with
Stephane_Grappelly
and
the
Quintet
of
the
Hot_Club
of
France
.
This
is
a
choice
item
and
Grappely
deserves
mention
too
,
of_course
.
He
is
one
of
the
few
men
in
history
who
plays
jazz
on
a
violin
.
They
play
:
``
Minor_Swing
''
,
``
Honeysuckle_Rose
''
,
``
Beyond_the_Sea
''
,
``
Bricktop
''
,
``
Heavy
Artillery
''
,
``
Djangology

,
``

``
I
Saw
Stars
''
,
``
Lover
Man
''
,
``
Menilmontant
''
and
``
Swing
42
''
.
All
this
is
great
proceedings
-
get
the
minutes
.
Kid_Ory
,
the
trombonist
chicken
farmer
,
is
also
one
of
the
solid
anchor
points
of
jazz
.
He
dates_back
to
the
days
before
the
first
sailing_ship
pulled
into
New_Orleans
.
His
horn
has
blown
loud
and
clear
across
the
land
for
more
years
than
he
cares
to
remember
.
Good
Time_Jazz
has
released
a
nice
two-record
album
which
he
made
.
He
is
starred
against
Alvin_Alcorn
,
trumpet

;
Cedric_Haywood
,

All
this
will
serve
to

the
Ory
style
in
fine
fashion
and
is
a
must
for
those
who
want
to
