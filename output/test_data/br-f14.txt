Everyone
with
a
personal
or
group
tragedy
to
relate
had_to
be
given
his
day
in
court
as
in
some
vast
collective
dirge
.
For
almost
two
months
,
the
defendant
and
the
world
heard
from
individuals
escaped
from
the
grave
about
fathers
and
mothers
,
graybeards
,
adolescents
,
babies
,
starved
,
beaten
to
death
,
strangled
,
machine-gunned
,
gassed
,
burned
.
One
who
had
been
a
boy
in
Auschwitz
had_to
tell
how
children
had
been
selected
by
height
for
the
gas_chambers
.
The
gruesome
humor
of
the
Nazis
was
not
forgotten
-
the
gas_chamber
with
a
sign
on
it
with
the
name
of
a
Jewish
foundation
and
bearing
a
copper
Star_of_David
-
nor
the
gratuitous
sadism
of
SS
officers
.
Public_relations
strategists
everywhere
,
watching
the
reaction
of
the
German
press
,
the
liberal
press
,
the
lunatic
fringe
press
,
listening
to
their
neighbors
,
studying
interviews
with
men
and
women
on
the
street
,
cried_out
:
Too_much
,
too_much
-
the
mind
of
the
audience
is
becoming
dulled
,
the
horrors
are
losing
their
effect
.
And
still
another
witness
,
one
who
had
crawled
out
from
under
a
heap
of
corpses
,
had_to
tell
how
the
victims
had
been
forced
to
lay
themselves
head
to
foot
one
on
top
of
the
other
before
being
shot
.
Most_of
this
testimony
may
have
been
legally
admissible
as
bearing_on
the
corpus_delicti
of
the
total
Nazi
crime
but
seemed
subject_to
question
when
not
tied
to
the
part
in
it
of
the
defendant
's
Department_of_Jewish_Affairs
.
Counsel
for
the
defense
,
however
,
shrewdly
allowing
himself
to
be
swept
by
the
current
of
dreadful
recollections
,
rarely
raised
an
objection
.
Would
not
the
emotional
catharsis
eventually
brought_on
by
this
awfulness
have
a
calming
,
if
not
exhausting
,
effect
likely
to
improve
his
client
's
chances
?
Those
who
feared
``
emotionalism
''
at
the
Trial
showed
less
understanding
than
Dr._Servatius
of
the
route
by
which
man
achieves
the
distance
necessary
for
fairness
toward
enemies
.
Interruptions
came
largely
from
the
bench
,
which
numerous
times
rebuked
the
Attorney_General
for
letting
his
witnesses
run
on
,
though
it
,
too
,
made
no
serious
effort
to
choke_off
the
flow
.
But
there
was
a
contrast
even
more
decisive
than
a
hunger
for
fact
between
the
Trial
in
Jerusalem
and
those
in
Moscow
and
New_York
.
In
each
of
the
last
,
the
trial
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
course
:
in
Moscow
the
liquidation
of
the
Old
Bolsheviks
and
the
tightening
of
Stalin
's
dictatorship
;
in
the
United_States
the
initiation
of
militant
anti
Communism
,
with
the
repentant
ex
Communist
in
the
vanguard
.
These
trials
were
properly
termed
``
political
cases
''
in_that
the
trial
itself
was
a
political
act
producing
political
consequences
.
But
what
could
the
Eichmann
Trial
initiate
?
Of
what
new
course
could
it
mark
the
beginning
?
The
Eichmann
case
looked_to
the
past
,
not
to
the
future
.
It
was
the
conclusion
of
the
first
phase
of
a
process
of
tragic
recollection
,
and
of
refining
the
recollection
,
that
will
last
as_long_as
there
are
Jews
.
As_such
,
it
was
beyond
politics
and
had
no
need
of
justification
by
a
``
message
''
.
``
It
is
not
an
individual
that
is
in
the
dock
at
this
historical
trial
''
-
said
Ben_Gurion
,
``
and
not
the
Nazi
regime
alone
-
but
anti-Semitism
throughout
history
''
.
How
could
supplying
Eichmann
with
a
platform
on
which
to
maintain
that
one
could
collaborate
in
the
murder
of
millions
of
Jews
without
being
an
anti-Semite
contribute
to
a
verdict
against
anti-Semitism
?
And
if
it
was
not
an
individual
who
was
in
the
dock
,
why
was
the
Trial
,
as
we
shall
observe
later
,
all_but
scuttled
in
the
attempt
to
prove
Eichmann
a
``
fiend
''
?
These
questions
touch
the
root
of
confusion
in
the
prosecution
's
case
.
It
might
be
contended
,
of_course
,
that
Eichmann
in
stubbornly
denying
anti-Semitic
feelings
was
lying
or
insisting
on
a
private
definition
of
anti-Semitism
.
But
in
either
event
he
was
the
wrong
man
for
the
kind
of
case
outlined
by
Ben_Gurion
and
set_forth
in
the
indictment
.
In
such
a
case
the
defendant
should
serve
as
a
clear
example
and
not
have_to
be
tied
to
the
issue
by
argument
.
One
who
could
be
linked
to
anti-Semitism
only
by
overcoming
his
objections
is
scarcely
a
good
specimen
of
the
Jew-baiter
throughout
the
ages
.
Shout
at
Eichmann
though
he
might
,
the
Prosecutor
could
not
establish
that
the
defendant
was
falsifying
the
way
he
felt
about
Jews
or
that
what
he
did
feel
fell_into
the
generally
recognized
category
of
anti-Semitism
.
Yes
,
he
believed
that
the
Jews
were
``
enemies
of
the
Reich
''
,
and
such
a
belief
is
,
of_course
,
typical
of
``
patriotic
''
anti-Semites
;
but
he
believed
in
the
Jew
as
enemy
in
a
kind
of
abstract
,
theological
way
,
like
a
member
of
a
cult
speculating
on
the
nature
of
things
.
The
real
question
was
how
one
passed
from
anti-Semitism
of_this
sort
to
murder
,
and
the
answer
to
this
question
is
not
to
be
found
in
anti-Semitism
itself
.
In
regard_to
Eichmann
,
it
was
to
be
found
in
the
Nazi
outlook
,
which
contained
a
principle
separate
from
and
far
worse
than
anti-Semitism
,
a
principle
by
which
the
poison
of
anti-Semitism
itself
was
made
more
virulent
.
Perhaps
under
the
guidance
of_this
Nazi
principle
one
could
,
as
Eichmann
declared
,
feel
personally
friendly
toward
the
Jews
and
still
be
their
murderer
.
Not
through
fear
of
disobeying
orders
,
as
Eichmann
kept
trying
to
explain
,
but
through
a
peculiar
giddiness
that
began
in
a
half
acceptance
of
the
vicious
absurdities
contained
in
the
Nazi
interpretation
of
history
and
grew
with
each
of
Hitler
's
victories
into
a
permanent
light_mindedness
and
sense
of
magical
rightness
that
was
able
to
respond
to
any
proposal
,
and
the
more
outrageous
the
better
,
``
Well
,
let
's
try
it
''
.
At_any_rate
,
the
substance
of
Eichmann
's
testimony
was
that
all
his
actions
flowed_from
his
membership
in
the
party
and
the
SS
,
and
though
the
Prosecutor
did
his
utmost
to
prove
actual
personal
hatred
of
Jews
,
his
success
on
this
score
was
doubtful
and
the
anti-Semitic
lesson
weakened
to_that_extent
.
But
if
the
Trial
did
not
expose
the
special
Nazi
mania
so
deadly
to
Jews
as_well_as
to
anyone
upon
whom
it
happened
to
light
,
neither
did
it
warn
very
effectively
against
the
ordinary
anti-Semitism
of
which
the
Nazis
made
such
effective
use
in
Germany
and
wherever
else
they
could
find
it
.
If
anti-Semitism
was
on_trial
in
Jerusalem
,
why
was
it
not
identified
,
and
with
enough
emphasis
to
capture
the
notice
of
the
world
press
,
in
its
connection
with
the
activities
of
Eichmann
's
Department_of_Jewish_Affairs
,
as
exemplified
by
the
betrayal
and
murder
of
Jews
by
non
police
and
non-party
anti-Semites
in
Germany
,
as_well_as
in
Poland
,
Czechoslovakia
,
Hungary
?
The
infamous
Wansee_Conference
called
by
Heydrich
in
January
1942
,
to
organize
the
material
and
technical
means
to
put_to_death
the
eleven
million
Jews
spread
throughout
the
nations
of
Europe
,
was
attended
by
representatives
of
major
organs
of
the
German
state
,
including
the
Reich_Minister_of_the_Interior
,
the
State_Secretary
in_charge
of
the
Four_Year_Plan
,
the
Reich_Minister_of_Justice
,
the
Under_Secretary_of_Foreign_Affairs
.
The
measures
for
annihilation
proposed
and
accepted
at
the
Conference
affected
industry
,
transportation
,
civilian
agencies
of
government
.
Heydrich
,
in
opening
the
Conference
,
followed
the
reasoning
and
even
the
phraseology
of
the
order
issued
earlier
by
Goering
which
authorized
the
Final_Solution
as
``
a
complement
to
''
previous
``
solutions
''
for
eliminating
the
Jews
from
German
living_space
through
violence
,
economic_strangulation
,
forced
emigration
,
and
evacuation
.
In_other_words
,
the
promulgators
of
the
murder
plan
made
clear
that
physically
exterminating
the
Jews
was
but
an
extension
of
the
anti-Semitic
measures
already
operating
in
every
phase
of
German
life
,
and
that
the
new
conspiracy
counted_on
the
general
anti-Semitism
that
had
made
those
measures
effective
,
as
a
readiness
for
murder
.
This
,
in_fact
,
it
turned_out
to
be
.
Since
the
magnitude
of
the
plan
made
secrecy
impossible
,
once
the
wheels
had
began
to
turn
,
persons
controlling
German
industries
,
social
institutions
,
and
armed_forces
became
,
through
their
anti-Semitism
or
their
tolerance
of_it
,
conscious
accomplices
of
Hitler
's
crimes
;
whether
in
the
last
degree
or
a
lesser
one
was
a
matter
to
be
determined
individually
.
What
more
could
be
asked
for
a
Trial
intended
to
warn
the
world
against
anti-Semitism
than
this
opportunity
to
expose
the
exact
link
between
the
respectable
anti-Semite
and
the
concentration-camp
brute
?
Not
in
Eichmann
's
anti-Semitism
but
in
the
anti-Semitism
of
the
sober
German
man_of_affairs
lay
the
potential
warning
of
the
Trial
.
No_doubt
many_of
the
citizens
of
the
Third_Reich
had
conceived
their
anti-Semitism
as
an
``
innocent
''
dislike
of
Jews
,
as
do
others
like
them
today
.
The
Final_Solution
proved
that
the
Jew-baiter
of
any
variety
exposes
himself
as
being
implicated
in
the
criminality
and
madness
of
others
.
Ought
not
an
edifying
Trial
have
made
every
effort
to
demonstrate
this
once_and_for_all
by
showing
how
representative
types
of
``
mere
''
anti-Semites
were
drawn
step_by_step
into
the
program
of
skull
bashings
and
gassings
?
The
Prosecutor
in
his
opening
remarks
did
refer
to
``
the
germ
of
anti-Semitism
''
among
the
Germans
which
Hitler
``
stimulated
and
transformed
''
.
But
if
there
was
evidence
at
the
Trial
that
aimed
over
Eichmann
's
head
at
his
collaborators
in
the
societies
where
he
functioned
,
the
press
seems
to
have
missed
it
.
Nor
did
the
Trial
devote
much
attention
to
exposing
the
usefulness
of
anti-Semitism
to
the
Nazis
,
both
in
building
their
own
power
and
in
destroying
that
of
rival
organizations
and
states
.
Certainly
,
one
of
the
best
ways
of
warning
the
world
against
anti-Semitism
is
to
demonstrate
its
workings
as
a
dangerous
weapon
.
Eichmann
himself
is
a
model
of
how
the
myth
of
the
enemy
Jew
can
be
used
to
transform
the
ordinary
man
of
present-day
society
into
a
menace
to
all
his
neighbors
.
Do
patriots
everywhere
know
enough
about
how
the
persecution
of
the
Jews
in
Germany
and
later
in
the
occupied
countries
contributed
to
terrorizing
the
populations
,
splitting
apart
individuals
and
groups
,
arousing
the
meanest
and
most
dishonest
impulses
,
pulverizing
trust
and
personal
dignity
,
and
finally
forcing
people
to
follow
their
masters
into
the
abyss
by
making
them
partners
in
unspeakable
crimes
?
The
career
of
Eichmann
made
the
Trial
a
potential
showcase
for
anti-Semitic
demoralization
:
fearful
of
being
mistaken
for
a
Jew
,
he
seeks
protection
in
his
Nazi
uniform
;
clinging
to
the
enemy
Jew
idea
,
he
is
forced
to
overcome
habits
of
politeness
and
neighborliness
;
once
in
power
he
begins
to
give_vent
to
a
criminal
opportunism
that
causes
him
to
alternate
between
megalomania
and
envy
of
those
above
him
.
``
Is
this
the
type
of
citizen
you
desire
''
?
the
Trial
should
have
asked
the
nations
.
But
though
this
characterization
in_no_way
diminished
Eichmann
's
guilt
,
the
Prosecutor
,
more
deeply
involved
in
the
tactics
of
a
criminal
case
than
a
political
one
,
would
have
none
of_it
.
Finally
,
if
the
mission
of
the
Trial
was
to
convict
anti-Semitism
,
how
could
it
have
failed
to
post
before
the
world
the
contrasting
fates
of
the
countries
in
which
the
Final_Solution
was
aided
by
native
Jew
haters
-
i.e.
,
Germany
,
Poland
,
Hungary
,
Czechoslovakia
-
and
those
in
which
it
met
the
obstacle
of
human
solidarity
-
Denmark
,
Holland
,
Italy
,
Bulgaria
,
France
?
Should
not
everyone
have
been
awakened
to_it
as
an
outstanding
fact
of
our
time
that
the
nations
poisoned
by
anti-Semitism
proved
less
fortunate
in
regard_to
their
own
freedom
than
those
whose
citizens
saved
their
Jewish
compatriots
from
the
transports
?
Was
n't
this
meaning
of
Eichmann
's
experience
in
various
countries
worth
highlighting
?
As
the
first
collective
confrontation
of
the
Nazi
outrage
,
the
Trial
of
Eichmann
represents
a
recovery
of
the
Jews
from
the
shock
of
the
death
camps
,
a
recovery
that
took
fifteen
years
and
which
is
still
by_no_means
complete
(
though
let
no
one
believe
that
it
could
be
hastened
by
silence
)
.
Only
across
a
distance
of
time
could
the
epic
accounting
begin
.
It
is
already
difficult
to
recall
how
little
we
knew
before
the
Trial
of
what
had
been
done
to
the
Jews
of
Europe
.
It
is
not
that
the
facts
of
the
persecution
were
unavailable
;
most_of
the
information
elicited
in
Jerusalem
had
been
brought
to
the
surface
by
the
numerous
War_Crimes
tribunals
and
investigating
commissions
,
and
by
reports
,
memoirs
,
and
survivors
'
accounts
.
