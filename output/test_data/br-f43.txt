Color
was
delayed
until
1935
,
the
wide_screen
until
the
early
fifties
.
Movement
itself
was
the
chief
and
often
the
only
attraction
of
the
primitive
movies
of
the
nineties
.
Each
film
consisted_of
fifty
feet
,
which
gives
a
running_time
of
about
one
minute
on
the
screen
.
As_long_as
audiences
came
to
see
the
movement
,
there
seemed
little
reason
to
adventure
further
.
Motion-picture
exhibitions
took_place
in
stores
in
a
general
atmosphere
like
that
of
the
penny_arcade
which
can
still
be
found
in
such
urban_areas
as
Times_Square
.
Brief
snips
of
actual
events
were
shown
:
parades
,
dances
,
street
scenes
.
The
sensational
and
frightening
enjoyed
popularity
:
a
train
rushes
straight
at
the
audience
,
or
a
great
wave
threatens
to
break
over
the
seats
.
An
early
Edison
production
was
The_Execution_of_Mary_Queen_of_Scotts
.
The
unfortunate
queen
mounted
the
scaffold
;
the
headsman
swung
his
axe
;
the
head
dropped
off
;
end
of
film
.
An
early
film
by
a
competitor
of
the
Wizard
of
Menlo_Park
simply
showed
a
long
kiss
performed
by
two
actors
of
the
contemporary
stage
.
In
the
field
of
entertainment
there
is
no
spur
to
financial
daring
so
effective
as
audience
boredom
,
and
the
first
decade
of
the
new
device
was
not
over
before
audiences
began
staying
away
in
large_numbers
from
the
simple-minded
,
one
minute
shows
.
In
response
,
the
industry
allowed
the
discovery
of
the
motion_picture
as
a
form
of
fiction
and
thus
gave
the
movies
the
essential
form
they
have
had
to
this
day
.
Despite
the
sheer
beauty
and
spectacle
of
numerous
documentaries
,
art
films
,
and
travelogues
,
despite
the
impressive
financial
success
of
such
a
recent
development
as
Cinerama
,
the
movies
are
at_heart
a
form
of
fiction
,
like
the
play
,
the
novel
,
or
the
short_story
.
Moreover
,
the
most
artistically
successful
of
the
nonfiction
films
have
invariably
borrowed
the
narrative
form
from
the
fiction
feature
.
Thus
such
great
American
documentaries
as
The_River
and
The_Plow_That_Broke_the_Plains
were
composed
as
visual
stories
rather_than
as
illustrated
lectures
.
The
discovery
that
movies
are
a
form
of
fiction
was
made
in
the
early
years
of
this
century
and
it
was
made
chiefly
by
two
men
,
a
French
magician
,
Georges_Melies
,
and
an
American
employee
of
Edison
,
Edwin_S._Porter
.
Of
the
two
,
Porter
is
justly
the
better_known
,
for
he
went
far
beyond
the
vital
finding
of
fiction
for
films
to
take
the
first_step
toward
fashioning
a
language
of
film
,
toward
making
the
motion_picture
the
intricate
,
efficient
time_machine
that
it
has
remained
since
,
even
in
the
most
inept
hands
.
Melies
,
however
,
out
of
his
professional
instincts
as
a
magician
,
discovered
and
made
use
of
a
number
of
illusionary
techniques
that
remain
part
of
the
vocabulary
of
film
.
One
of
these
is
the
``
dissolve
''
,
which
makes
possible
a
visually
smooth
transition
from
scene
to
scene
.
As
the
first
scene
begins
to
fade
,
the
succeeding
scene
begins
to
appear
.
For
a
moment
or
two
,
both
scenes
are
present
simultaneously
,
one
growing
weaker
,
one
growing
stronger
.
In
a
series
of
fairy_tales
and
fantasies
,
Melies
demonstrated
that
the
film
is
superbly
equipped
to
tell
a
straightforward
story
,
with
beginning
,
middle
and
end
,
complications
,
resolutions
,
climaxes
,
and
conclusions
.
Immediately
,
the
film
improved
and
it
improved
because
in
narrative
it
found
a
content
based
on
time
to
complement
its
own
unbreakable
connection
with
time
.
Physically
,
a
movie
is
possible
because
a
series
of
images
is
projected
one
at_a_time
at
such
a
speed
that
the
eye
``
remembers
''
the
one
that
has
gone
before
even
as
it
registers
the
one
now
appearing
.
Linking
the
smoothly
changing
images
together
,
the
eye
itself
endows
them
with
the
illusion
of
movement
.
The
``
projection
''
time
of
painting
and
sculpture
is
highly
subjective
,
varying
from
person
to
person
and
even
varying
for
a
given
person
on
different
occasions
.
So
is
the
time
of
the
novel
.
The
drama
in
the
theater
and
the
concert
in
the
hall
both
have
a
fixed
time
,
but
the
time
is
fixed
by
the
director
and
the
players
,
the
conductor
and
the
instrumentalists
,
subject
,
therefore
,
to
much
variation
,
as
record
collectors
well
know
.
The
time
of
the
motion_picture
is
fixed
absolutely
.
The
film
consists_of
a
series
of
still
,
transparent
photographs
,
or
``
frames
''
,
35
-
mm.
-
wide
.
Each
frame
comes
between
the
light
and
the
lens
and
is
individually
projected
on
the
screen
,
at
the
rate
,
for
silent_movies
,
of
16
frames
per
second
,
and
,
for
sound
films
,
24
frames
per
second
.
This
is
the
rate
of
projection
;
it
is
also
the
rate
of
photographing
.
Time
is
built
into
the
motion_picture
,
which
cannot
exist
without
time
.
Now
time
is
also
the
concern
of
the
fictional
narrative
,
which
is
,
at
its
simplest
,
the
story
of
an
action
with
,
usually
,
a
beginning
,
a
middle
,
and
an
end
-
elements
which
demand
time
as
the
first
condition
for
their
existence
.
The
``
moving
''
picture
of
the
train
or
the
wave
coming
at
the
audience
is
,
to_be_sure
,
more
intense
than
a
still
picture
of
the
same
subject
,
but
the
difference
is
really
one
of
degree
;
the
cinematic
element
of
time
is
merely
used
to
increase
the
realism
of
an
object
which
would
still
be
reasonably
realistic
in
a
still
photo
.
In
narrative
,
time
is
essential
,
as
it
is
in
film
.
Almost
everything
about
the
movies
that
is
peculiarly
of
the
movies
derives
from
a
tension
created
and
maintained
between
narrative
time
and
film
time
.
This
discovery
of
Melies
was
vastly
more
important
than
his
sometimes
dazzling
,
magician
's
tricks
produced
on
film
.
It
was
Porter
,
however
,
who
produced
the
very
first
movie
whose
name
has
lived
on
through
the
half
century
of
film
history
that
has
since
ensued
.
The
movie
was
The
Great_Train_Robbery
and
its
effects
on
the
young
industry
and
art
were
all_but
incalculable
.
Overnight
,
for_one_thing
,
Porter
's
film
multiplied
the
standard
running_time
of
movies
by
ten
.
The
Great_Train_Robbery
is
a
one
reel
film
.
One
reel
-
from
eight
to
twelve
minutes
-
became
the
standard
length
from
the
year
of
Robbery
,
1903
,
until
Griffith
shattered
that
limit
forever
with
Birth_of_a_Nation
in
1915
.
The
reel
itself
became
and
still
is
the
standard
of
measure
for
the
movies
.
The
material
of
the
Porter
film
is
simplicity
itself
;
much
of_it
has
continued
to
be
used
over
the
years
and
the
heart
of_it
-
good_guys
and
bad_guys
in
the
old
West
-
pretty
well
dominated
television
toward
the
end
of
the
1950's
.
A
band
of
robbers
enters
a
railroad_station
,
overpowers
and
ties_up
the
telegraph_operator
,
holds_up
the
train
and
escapes
.
A
posse
is
formed
and
pursues
the
robbers
,
who
,
having
made
their
escape
,
are
whooping_it_up
with
some
wild
,
wild
women
in
a
honky-tonk
hide-out
.
The
robbers
run
from
the
hide-out
,
take
cover
in
a
wooded
declivity
,
and
are
shot
dead
by
the
posse
.
As
a
finale
is
appended
a
close-up
of
one
of
the
band
taking_aim
and
firing
his
revolver
straight
at
the
audience
.
All
this
is
simple
enough
,
but
in
telling
the
story
Porter
did
two
important
things
that
had
not
been
done
before
.
Each
scene
is
shot
straight
through
,
as
had
been
the
universal
custom
,
from
a
camera
fixed
in
a
single
position
,
but
in
the
outdoor
scenes
,
especially
in
the
capture
and
destruction
of
the
outlaws
,
Porter
's
camera
position
breaks
,
necessarily
,
with
the
camera
position
standard
until
then
,
which
had
been
,
roughly
,
that
of
a
spectator
in
a
center
orchestra
seat
at
a
play
.
The
plane
of
the
action
in
the
scene
is
not
parallel
with
the
plane
of
the
film
in
the
camera
or
on
the
screen
.
If
the
change
,
at_first_sight
,
seems
minor
,
we
may
recall
that
it
took
the
Italian
painters
about
two
hundred
years
to
make
an
analogous
change
,
and
the
Italian
painters
,
by
universal
consent
,
were
the
most
brilliant
group
of
geniuses
any
art
has
seen
.
In
that
apparently
simple
shift
Porter
opened
the
way
to
the
sensitive
use
of
the
camera
as
an
instrument
of
art
as_well_as
a
mechanical
recording
device
.
He
did
more
than
that
.
He
revealed
the
potential
value
of
the
``
cut
''
as
the
basic
technique
in
the
art
of
the
film
.
Cutting
,
of_course
,
takes_place
automatically
in
the
creation
of
a
film
.
The
meaning
of
the
word
is
quite
physical
,
to_begin_with
.
The
physical
film
is
cut
with
a
knife
at
the
end
of
one
complete
sequence
,
and
the
cut
edge
is
joined
physically
,
by
cement
,
to
the
cut
edge
of
the
beginning
of
the
next
sequence
.
If
,
as
a
home_movie
maker
,
you
shoot
the
inevitable
footage
of
your
child
taking
its
first
steps
,
you
have
merely
recorded
an
historical
event
.
If
,
in
preparing
that
shot
for
the
inevitable
showing
to
your
friends
,
you
interrupt
the
sequence
to
paste
in
a_few
frames
of
the
child
's
grandmother
watching
this
event
,
you
have
begun
to
be
an
artist
in
film
;
you
are
employing
the
basic
technique
of
film
;
you
are
cutting
.
This
is
what
Porter
did
.
As
the
robbers
leave
the
looted
train
,
the
film
suddenly
cuts_back
to
the
station
,
where
the
telegrapher
's
little
daughter
arrives
with
her
father
's
dinner_pail
only
to
find
him
bound
on
the
floor
.
She
dashes
around
in
alarm
.
The
two
events
are
taking_place
at_the_same_time
.
Time
and
space
have
both
become
cinematic
.
We
leap
from
event
to
event
-
including
the
formation
of
the
posse
-
even
though
the
events
,
in
``
reality
''
are
taking_place
not
in
sequence
but
simultaneously
,
and
not
near
each
other
but
at
a
considerable
distance
.
The
``
chase
''
as
a
standard
film
device
probably
dates_from
The_Great_Train_Robbery
,
and
there
is
a
reason
for
the
continued
popularity
of
the
device
.
The
chase
in
itself
is
a
narrative
;
it
presumes
both
speed
and
urgency
and
it
demands
cutting
-
both
from
pursued
to
pursuer
and
from
stage
to
stage
of
the
journey
of
both
.
The
simple
,
naked
idea
of
one
man
chasing
another
is
of
its
nature
better
fitted
for
the
film
than
it
is
for
any
other
form
of
fiction
.
The
cowboy
films
,
the
cops
and
robbers
films
,
and
the
slapstick
comedy
films
culminating
in
an
insane
chase
are
not_only
catering
to
what
critics
may
assume
to
be
a
vulgar
taste
for
violence
;
these
films
and
these
sequences
are
also
seeking_out
-
instinctively
or
by_design
-
the
peculiarly
cinematic
elements
of
narrative
.
There
still
remained
the
need
for
one
great
film
artist
to
explore
the
full
potential
of
the
new
form
and
to
make
it
an
art
.
The
man
was
D.W._Griffith
.
When
he
came
to
the
movies
-
more_or_less
by
accident
-
they
were
still
cheap
entertainment
capable
of
enthralling
the
unthinking
for
an
idle
few
minutes
.
In
about
seven
years
Griffith
either
invented
or
first
realized
the
possibilities
of
virtually
every
resource
at
the
disposal
of
the
film_maker
.
Before
he
was
forty
Griffith
had
created
the
art
of
the
film
.
Not
that
there
had
not
been
attempts
,
mostly
European
,
to
do
exactly
that
.
But
in_general
the
European
efforts
to
make
an
art
of
the
entertainment
had
ignored
the
slowly
emerging
language
of
the
film
itself
.
Staggeringly
condensed
versions
of
famous
novels
and
famous
plays
were
presented
.
Great
actors
and
actresses
-
the
most
notable
being
Sarah_Bernhardt
-
were
hired
to
repeat
their
stage
performances
before
the
camera
.
In
all_of
this
extensive
and
expensive
effort
,
the
camera
was
downgraded
to
the
status
of
recording
instrument
for
art_work
produced
elsewhere
by
the
actor
or
by
the
author
.
The
phonograph
today
,
for
all
its
high_fidelity
and
stereophonic
sound
,
is
precisely
what
the
early
art
purveyors
in
the
movies
wished
to
make
of
the
camera
.
Not
surprisingly
,
this
approach
did
not
work
.
The
effort
produced
a
valuable
record
of
stage
techniques
in
the
early
years
of
the
century
and
some
interesting
records
of
great
theater
figures
who
would
otherwise
be
only
names
.
But
no
art
at_all
was_born
of
the
art
effort
in
the
early
movies
.
