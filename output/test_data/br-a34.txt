One
of
the
initial
questions
put
to
President_Kennedy
at
his
first
news_conference
last
January
was
about
his
attitude
toward
a
meeting
with
Premier_Khrushchev
.
Mr._Kennedy
replied
:
``
I
'm
hopeful
that
from
more
traditional
exchanges
we
can
perhaps
find
greater
common
ground
''
.
The
President
knew
that
a
confrontation
with
Mr._Khrushchev
sooner_or_later
probably
was
inevitable
and
even
desirable
.
But
he
was
convinced
that
the
realities
of
power
-
military
,
economic
and
ideological
-
were
the
decisive_factors
in
the
struggle
with
the
Communists
and
that
these
could
not
be
talked
away
at
a
heads
of
government
meeting
.
He
wanted
to
buy_time
to
strengthen
the
U._S.
and
its
allies
and
to
define
and
begin
to
implement
his
foreign_policy
.
Last
Friday
the
White_House
announced
:
President_Kennedy
will
meet
with
Soviet
Premier_Nikita_S._Khrushchev
in
Vienna_June
3
and
4
.
The
announcement
came_after
a
period
of
sharp
deterioration
in
East-West
relations
.
The
heightened
tension
,
in_fact
,
had
been
a
major
factor
in
the
President
's
change
of
view
about
the
urgency
of
a
meeting
with
the
Soviet
leader
.
He
was
not
going_to
Vienna
to
negotiate
-
the
simultaneous
announcements
in
Washington
and
Moscow
last
week
stressed
that
no
formal
negotiations
were
planned
.
But
Mr._Kennedy
had
become
convinced
that
a
personal
confrontation
with
Mr._Khrushchev
might
be
the
only
way
to
prevent
catastrophe
.
That
objective
set
the
high
stakes
and
drama
of
the
Vienna
meeting
.
Despite
efforts
by
Washington
last
week
to
play_down
the
significance
of
the
meeting
,
it
clearly
was
going
to
be
one
of
the
crucial
encounters
of
the
cold_war
.
The
U._S.
and
Soviet
heads
of
Government
have
met
three_times
since
Sir_Winston_Churchill
in
1953
introduced
a
new
word
into
international
diplomacy
with
his
call_for
a
fresh
approach
to
the
problem
of
peace
``
at
the
summit
of
the
nations
''
.
The
first
time
was
in
1955
when
a
full-dress
Big
Four
summit_meeting
produced
the
``
spirit
of
Geneva
''
.
The
spirit
served
chiefly
to
lull
the
West
while
Moscow
made
inroads
into
the
Middle_East
.
In
1959
President_Eisenhower
and
Premier_Khrushchev
held
an
informal
session
in
the
U._S.
.
That
meeting
produced
the
``
spirit
of
Camp_David
''
-
a
spirit
,
it
later
turned_out
,
that
masked
a
basic
misunderstanding
about
progress
toward
a
Berlin
settlement
.
On
the
third
occasion
-
another
Big
Four
summit
session
at
Paris
a
year
ago
-
there
was
no
problem
of
an
illusory
``
spirit
''
.
Premier_Khrushchev
wrecked
the
conference
at
its
initial
session
with
a
bitter
denunciation
of
the
U._S.
for
the
U-2
incident
.
The
episode
tended
to
confirm
the
U._S.
belief
that
propaganda
,
the
hope
of
one-sided
concessions
,
and
the
chance
to
split
the
Allies
,
rather_than
genuine
negotiation
,
were
the
Soviet
leader
's
real
aims
in
summitry
.
Thus
when
Premier_Khrushchev
intimated
even
before
inauguration
that
he
hoped
for
an
early
meeting
with
the
new
President
,
Mr._Kennedy
was
confronted
with
a
delicate
problem
.
Shortly
before
his
nomination
he
had
set_forth
his
basic
view
about
the
problem
of
negotiations
with
the
Soviet
leader
in
these
words
:
``
As
long
as
Mr._Khrushchev
is
convinced
that
the
balance
of
world_power
is
shifting
his
way
,
no
amount
of
either
smiles
or
toughness
,
neither
Camp_David
talks
nor
kitchen
debates
,
can
compel
him
to
enter
fruitful
negotiations
''
.
The
President
had
set
for
himself
the
task
,
which
he
believed
vital
,
of
awakening
the
U._S.
and
its
allies
to
the
hard
and
complex
effort
necessary
to
shift
that
balance
.
He
did
not
want
the
effort
weakened
by
any
illusion
that
summit
magic
might
make
it
unnecessary
.
He
wanted
time
,
too
,
to
review
the
United_States
'
global
commitments
and
to
test
both
the
policies
he
had
inherited
and
new
ones
he
was
formulating
.
Above_all
,
he
did
not
want
to
appear
to
be
running
hat
in_hand
to
Premier_Khrushchev
's
doorstep
.
At_the_same_time
the
President
took_pains
not
to
rule_out
an
eventual
meeting
with
the
Soviet
leader
.
Ideally
,
he
knew
,
it
should
be
preceded
by
concrete
progress
at
lower
levels
.
But
Mr._Kennedy
saw
value
even
in
an
informal
meeting
,
provided
that
undue
hopes
were
not
raised
in
connection
with_it
.
It
would
give
him
an
opportunity
to
take
the
measure
of
his
chief
adversary
in
the
cold_war
,
to
try
to
probe
Mr._Khrushchev
's
intentions
and
to
make
clear
his
own
views
.
Moreover
,
an
eventual
meeting
was
desirable
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
satisfy
world
opinion
that
the
U._S.
was
not
inflexible
and
was
sparing
no
effort
to
ease
international
tensions
.
Both
elements
-
the
caution
about
a
meeting
,
the
willingness
eventually
to
hold
one
-
were
reflected
in
a
letter
from
the
President
which
Ambassador_Llewellyn_E._Thompson
brought
back
to
Russia
late
in
February
.
The
letter
,
dated
Feb.
22
,
was
delivered
to
Premier_Khrushchev
in
Novosibirsk
,
Siberia
,
on
March
9
.
It
dealt
mainly
with
a
broad
range
of
East-West
issues
.
But
it
also
briefly
suggested
the
possibility
of
a
meeting
with
Mr._Khrushchev
before
the
end
of
the
year
if
the
international
climate
were
favorable
and
schedules
permitted
.
Developments
over
the
next
two
months
,
however
,
caused
the
President
to
reconsider
the
question
of
the
timing
.
There
were
intense
discussions
in
the
inner
councils
of
the
White_House
about
the
advisability
of
an
early
meeting
,
not
because
the
international
climate
was
improving
,
but
precisely
because
it
was
deteriorating
alarmingly
.
The
President
was
especially
concerned
about
the
deadlock
in
the
nuclear
test
ban
negotiations
at
Geneva
.
The
deadlock
has
been
caused
by
the
Russians
'
new
demand
for
a
three-man
(
East
,
West
and
neutral
)
directorate
,
and
thus
a
veto
,
over
the
control
machinery
.
In
the
U._S.
,
strong
pressures
have
been
building_up
for
a
resumption
of
tests
on
grounds
that
the
Russians
may
be
secretly
testing
.
Mr._Kennedy
was
less
troubled
by
that
possibility
than
by
the
belief
that
a
Geneva
breakdown
,
or
even
continued
stalemate
,
would
mean
an
unchecked
spread
of
nuclear_weapons
to
other
countries
as_well
as
a
fatal
blow
to
any
hope
for
disarmament
.
There
was
reason
to
believe
that
Premier_Khrushchev
was
also
concerned
about
a
possible
spread
of
nuclear_weapons
,
particularly
to
Communist_China
.
The
question
arose
as
to
whether
a
frank
discussion
of_that
danger
with
the
Soviet
leader
had
not
become
urgent
.
Moreover
,
Moscow
appeared
determined
to
apply
the
tripartite
veto
principle
to
the
executive
organs
of
all
international
bodies
,
including
the
U._N._Secretariat
and
the
International_Control_Commission
for
Laos
.
Mr._Kennedy
was
convinced
that
insistence
on
the
demand
would
make
international
agreements
,
or
even
negotiations
,
impossible
.
Developments
in
Cuba
and
Laos
also
suggested
the
advisability
of
an
early
summit_meeting
.
Initially
the
White_House
reaction
was
that
the
bitter
exchanges
with
Moscow
over
Cuba
and
the
conflict
in
Laos
had
dampened
prospects
for
a
meeting
.
At_the_same_time
,
there
was
increased
reason
for
a
quick
meeting
lest
the
Soviet
leader
,
as
a
result
of
those
episodes
,
come_to
a
dangerously
erroneous
conclusion
about
the
West
's
ability
and
determination
to
resist
Communist
pressure
.
In
Cuba
,
the
U._S.
had
blundered
badly
and
created
the
impression
of
impotency
against
Communist
penetration
even
on
its
own
doorstep
.
In
Laos
,
the
picture
was
almost
equally
bad
.
U._S.
willingness
to
accept
a
neutral
Laos
may
have
led
Premier_Khrushchev
to
believe
that
other
areas
could
be
``
neutralized
''
on
Soviet
terms
.
Beyond
that
,
Allied
disagreement
about
military
intervention
in
Laos
-
despite
warnings
that
they
might
do
so
-
allowed
Moscow
to
carry_out
with
impunity
a
series
of
military
and
diplomatic
moves
that
greatly
strengthened
the
pro-Communist
forces
.
As
a
result
,
the
West
is
in
a
poor
bargaining
position
at
the
current
Geneva
negotiations
on
Laos
,
and
South_Vietnam
and
other
nations
in
Southeast_Asia
are
under
increased
pressure
.
In
the
light
of
those
events
,
there
appeared
to
be
a
real
danger
that
Premier_Khrushchev
might
overreach
himself
.
Ambassador_Thompson
reported
from
Moscow
that
the
Soviet
leader
's
mood
was
cocky
and
aggressive
.
He
has
indicated
that
he
plans
new
moves
on
Berlin
before
the
year
is
out
.
The
President
and
his
advisers
felt
that
the
time
might
have
come
to
warn
Premier_Khrushchev
against
a
grave
miscalculation
in
areas
such_as
Berlin
,
Iran
or
Latin_America
from
which
there
would
be
no
turning_back
.
It
was
in_the_midst
of
such
White_House
deliberations
that
Premier_Khrushchev
on
May
4
made
new
inquiries
through
the
U._S._Embassy
in
Moscow
about
a
meeting
with
the
President
in
the
near
future
.
Mr._Kennedy
told
Moscow
he
would
give
his
answer
by
May
20
after
consultation
with
the
Allies
.
The
response
from
London
,
Paris
and
Bonn
was
favorable
.
Firm
arrangements
for
the
meeting
in
Vienna
were
worked_out
in
a
final
exchange
between
Moscow
and
Washington
last
week
.
Apparently
at
the
insistence
of
the
U._S.
,
the
simultaneous
announcements
issued
in
Washington
and
Moscow
last
Friday
emphasized
the
``
informal
''
nature
of
the
meeting
.
The
Washington
announcement
said
:
``
The
President
and
Chairman_Khrushchev
understand
that
this
meeting
is
not
for_the_purpose_of
negotiating
or
reaching
agreement
on
the
major
international
problems
that
involve
the
interest
of
many
other
countries
.
The
meeting
will
,
however
,
afford
a
timely
and
convenient
opportunity
for
the
first
personal
contact
between
them
and
a
general
exchange
of
views
on
the
major
issues
which
affect
the
relationships
between
the
two
countries
''
.
The
Vienna
meeting
will
bring_together
a
seasoned
,
67
-
year-old
veteran
of
the
cold_war
who
,
in
Mr._Kennedy
's
own
words
,
is
``
shrewd
,
tough
,
vigorous
,
well-informed
and
confident
''
,
and
a
44
-
year-old
President
(
his
birthday
is
May
29
)
with
a
demonstrated
capacity
for
political
battle
but
little
experience
in
international
diplomacy
.
The
announcement
last
week
of
the
forthcoming
encounter
produced
strong
reactions
in
the
U._S.
of
both
approval
and
disapproval
.
The
approval
did
not
arise
from
an
expectation
of
far-reaching
agreements
at
Vienna
.
The
inclination
was
to
accept
the
statement
that
there
would
be
no
formal
negotiations
.
But
those
who
were
in
favor
of
the
meeting
felt
that
a
frank
exchange
between
the
two
men
and
an
opportunity
to
size
one
another
up
would
prove
salutary
.
Mr._Khrushchev
is
known
to
rely
heavily
on
his
instincts
about
his
adversaries
and
to
be
a
shrewd
judge
of
men
.
The
feeling
was
that
he
would
sense
an
inner
core
of
toughness
and
determination
in
the
President
and
that
plain
talk
by
Mr._Kennedy
would
give
him
pause
.
Apart
from
the
personal_equation
,
another
reason
advanced
in
favor
of
the
meeting
was
that
too
often
in_the_past
the
U._S.
appeared
to
have
been
dragged
reluctantly
to
the
summit
.
Premier_Khrushchev
has
made
propaganda
capital
out
of_that
fact
and
in_the_end
got
his
summit_meeting
anyway
.
This
time
the
initiative
came
,
in_part
at_least
,
from
Washington
.
There
was
also
the
fact
that
by
the
time
he
meets
Mr._Khrushchev
,
the
President
will
have
completed
conversations
with
all
the
other
principal
Allied
leaders
.
Thus
he
will
be
in
a
position
to
disabuse
the
Soviet
leader
of
any
notions
he
may
have
about
grave
Allied
disunity
.
Finally
,
there
was
a
wide
area
of
agreement
on
the
value
of
the
President
's
making
a
final
effort
in
the
summit
spotlight
for
a
nuclear
test
accord
.
There
is
no
single
issue
that
has
aroused
stronger
feelings
throughout_the_world
.
If
tests
are
to
be
resumed
,
the
argument
went
,
it
is
vital
that
the
U._S.
make
plain
that
the
onus
belongs_to
the
Soviet_Union
.
Disapproval
of
the
meeting
was
based
largely
on
the
belief
that
the
timing
could
hardly
be
worse
.
After
Cuba
and
Laos
,
it
was
argued
,
Mr._Khrushchev
will
interpret
the
President
's
consent
to
the
meeting
as
further
evidence
of
Western
weakness
-
perhaps
even
panic
-
and
is
certain
to
try
to
exploit
the
advantage
he
now
believes
he
holds
.
Moreover
,
the
President
is
meeting
the
Soviet
leader
at_a_time
when
the
Administration
has
still
not
decided
on
the
scope
of
America
's
firm
foreign_policy
commitments
.
The
question
was
raised
,
for_example
,
as
to
what
attitude
the
President
would
take
if
Mr._Khrushchev
proposes
a
broad
neutral
belt
extending
from
Southeast_Asia
to
the
Middle_East
.
