The
lyric
beauties
of
Schubert
's
Trout_Quintet
-
its
elemental
rhythms
and
infectious
melodies
-
make
it
a
source
of
pure
pleasure
for
almost
all
music
listeners
.
But
for
students
of
musical
forms
and
would-be
classifiers
,
the
work
presents
its
problems
.
Since
it
requires
only
five
players
,
it
would
seem
to
fall_into
the
category
of
chamber_music
-
yet
it
calls_for
a
double_bass
,
an
instrument
generally
regarded_as
symphonic
.
Moreover
,
the
piece
is
written
in
five
movements
,
rather_than
the
conventional
four
of
most
quintets
,
and
this
gives
the
opus
a
serenade
or
divertimento
flavor
.
The
many
and
frequent
performances
of
the
Trout
serve
to
emphasize
the
dual
nature
of
its
writing
.
Some
renditions
are
of
symphonic
dimensions
,
with
the
contrabass
given
free_rein
.
Other
interpretations
present
the
music
as
an
essentially
intimate
creation
.
In
these
readings
,
the
double_bass
is
either
kept
discreetly
in
the
background
,
or
it
is
dressed
in
clown
's
attire
-
the
musical
equivalent
of
a
bull_in_a_china_shop
.
Recently
I
was
struck
anew
by
the
divergent
approaches
,
when
in
the
course
of
one
afternoon
and
evening
I
listened
to
no
fewer
than
ten
different
performances
.
The
occasion
for
this
marathon
:
Angel
's
long
awaited
reissue
in
its
``
Great_Recordings_of_the_Century
''
series
of
the
Schnabel-Pro_Arte
version
.
Let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
the
music
sounded
as
sparkling
on
the
last
playing
as
it
did
on
the
first
.
Whether
considered
alone
or
in_relation_to
other
editions
,
COLH
40
is
a
document
of
prime
importance
.
Artur_Schnabel
was
one
of
the
greatest
Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart
players
of_all_time
,
and
any
commentary
of
his
on
this
repertory
is
valuable
.
But
Schnabel
was
a
great
teacher
in_addition_to
being
a
great
performer
,
and
the
fact
that
four
of
the
ten
versions
I
listened
to
are
by
Schnabel
pupils
(
Clifford_Curzon
,
Frank_Glazer
,
Adrian_Aeschbacher
,
and
Victor_Babin
)
also
sheds_light_on
the
master
's
pedagogical
skills
.
Certain
pianistic
traits
are
common
to
all
five
Schnabelian
renditions
,
most
notably
the
``
Schnabel
trill
''
(
which
differs
from
the
conventional
trill
in_that
the
two
notes
are
struck
simultaneously
)
.
But
the
most
impressive
testimony
to
Schnabel
's
distinction
as
a
teacher
is
reflected
by
the
individuality
which
marks
each
student
's
approach
as
distinctly
his
own
.
Schnabel
's
emphasis
on
structural
clarity
,
his
innate
rhythmic
vibrancy
,
and
impetuous
intensity
all
tend
to
stamp
his
reading
as
a
symphonic
one
.
Yet
no
detail
was
too
small
to
receive
attention
from
this
master
,
and
as
a
result
the
playing
here
has
humor
,
delicacy
,
and
radiant
humanity
.
This
is
a
serious
minded
interpretation
,
but
it
is
never
strait-laced
.
And
although
Schnabel
's
pianism
bristles
with
excitement
,
it
is
meticulously
faithful
to
Schubert
's
dynamic
markings
and
phrase
indications
.
The
piano
performance
on
this
Trout
is
one
that
really
demands
a
search
for
superlatives
.
About
the
Pro_Arte
's
contribution
I
am
less
happy
.
I
,
for
one
,
rather
regret
that
Schnabel
did
n't
collaborate
with
the
Budapest_Quartet
,
whose
rugged
,
athletic
playing
was
a
good_deal
closer
to
this
pianist
's
interpretative
outlook
than
the
style
of
the
Belgian
group
.
From
a
technical
standpoint
,
the
string
playing
is
good
,
but
the
Pro_Arte
people
fail
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
things
here
.
The
violinist
,
in
particular
,
is
very
indulgent
with
swoops
and
slides
,
and
his
tone
is
pinched
and
edgy
.
The
twenty-five
year
old
recording
offers
rather
faded
string
tone
,
but
the
balance
between
the
instruments
is
good
and
the
transfer
is
very
quiet
.
There
is
a
break
in
continuity
just
before
the
fourth
variation
in
the
``
Forellen
''
movement
,
and
I
suspect
that
this
is_due
to
imperfect
splicing
between
sides
of
the
original
SPs
.
Turning_to
the
more
modern
versions
,
Curzon
's
(
London
)
offers
the
most
sophisticated
keyboard
work
.
Every
detail
in
his
interpretation
has
been
beautifully
thought_out
,
and
of
these
I
would
especially
cite
the
delicious
landler
touch
the
pianist
brings
to
the
fifth
variation
(
an
obvious
indication
that
he
is
playing
with
Viennese
musicians
)
,
and
the
gossamer
shading
throughout
.
Some
of
Curzon
's
playing
strikes
me
as
finicky
,
however
.
Why
,
for_example
,
does
he
favor
two
tempos
,
rather
than
one
,
for
the
third
movement
?
The
assisting
musicians
from
the
Vienna_Octet
are
somewhat
lacking
in
expertise
,
but
their
contribution
is
rustic
and
appealing
.
(
Special
compliments
to
the
double_bass
playing
of
Johann_Krumpp
:
his
scrawny
,
tottering
sound
adds
a
delightful
hilarity
to
the
performance
.
)
The
Glazer-Fine_Arts
edition
(
Concert-Disc
)
is
a
model
of
lucidity
and
organization
.
It
is
,
moreover
,
a
perfectly
integrated
ensemble
effort
.
But
having
lived
with
the
disc
for
some
time
now
,
I
find
the
performance
less
exciting
than
either
Schnabel
's
or
Fleisher
's
(
whose
superb
performance
with
the
Budapest_Quartet
has
still
to
be
recorded
)
and
a
good_deal
less
filled
with
humor
than
Curzon
's
.
Aeschbacher
's
work
is
very_much
akin
to
Schnabel
's
,
but
the
sound
on
his
Decca
disc
is
dated
,
and
you
will
have
a
hard_time
locating
a
copy
of
it
.
The
Hephzibah_Menuhin-Amadeus_Quartet
(
Angel
)
and
Victor_Babin-Festival_Quartet
(
RCA_Victor
)
editions
give
us
superlative
string
playing
(
both
in
symphonic
style
)
crippled
by
unimaginative
piano
playing
.
(
Babin
has
acquired
some
of
Schnabel
's
keyboard
manner
,
but
his
playing
is
of
limited
insight
.
)
Badura-Skoda-Vienna_Konzerthaus
(
Westminster
)
and
Demus-Schubert_Quartet
(
Deutsche_Grammophon
)
are
both
warm_toned
,
pleasantly
lyrical
,
but
rather
slack
and
tensionless
.
Helmut_Roloff
,
playing
with
a
group
of
musicians
from
the
Bayreuth_Ensemble
,
gives
a
sturdy
reading
,
in
much
the
same
vein
as
that
of
the
last_mentioned
pianists
.
Telefunken
has
accorded
him
beautiful
sound
,
and
this
bargain-priced
disc
(
it
sells
for
$
2.98
)
is
worthy
of
consideration
.
Returning
once_again
to
the
Schnabel
reissue
,
I
am
beguiled
anew
by
the
magnificence
of
this
pianist
's
musical
penetration
.
Here
is
truly
a
``
Great
Recording
of
the
Century
''
,
and
its
greatness
is
by_no_means
diminished
by
the
fact
that
it
is
not
quite
perfect
.
This
recording
surely
belongs
in
everyone
's
collection
.
Must
records
always
sound
like
records
?
From
the
beginning
of
commercial
recording
,
new
discs
purported
to
be
indistinguishable
from
The
Real_Thing
have
regularly
been
put
in
circulation
.
Seen
in
perspective
,
many_of
these
releases
have
a
genuine
claim
to
be
milestones
.
Although
lacking
absolute
verisimilitude
,
they
supply
the
ear
and
the
imagination
with
all
necessary
materials
for
re-creation
of
the
original
.
On
the
basis
of
what
they
give
us
we
can
know
how
the
young
Caruso
sang
,
appreciate
the
distinctive
qualities
of
Parsifal
under
Karl_Muck
's
baton
,
or
sense
the
type
of
ensemble
Toscanini
created
in
his
years
with
the
New_York_Philharmonic
.
Since
the
concept
of
high_fidelity
became
important
some
dozen
years
ago
,
the
claims
of
technical
improvements
have
multiplied
tenfold
.
In
many
cases
the
revolutionary
production
has
offered
no
more
than
sensational
effects
:
the
first
hearing
was
fascinating
and
the
second
disillusioning
as
the
gap
between
sound
and
substance
became
clearer
.
Other
innovations
with
better
claims
to
musical
interest
survived
rehearing
to
acquire
in_time
the
status
of
classics
.
If
we
return
to
them
today
,
we
have
no
difficulty
spotting
their
weaknesses
but
we
find
them
still
pleasing
.
Records
sound
like
records
because
they
provide
a
different
sort
of
experience
than
live
music
.
This
difference
is
made_up
of
many
factors
.
Some
of
them
are
obvious
,
such
as
the
fact
that
we
associate
recorded
and
live
music
with
our
responses
and
behavior
in
different
types
of
environments
and
social
settings
.
(
Music
often
sounds
best
to
me
when
I
can
dress
informally
and
sit
in
something
more
comfortable
than
a
theatre
seat
.
)
From
the
technical
standpoint
,
records
differ
from
live
music
to
the
degree
that
they
fail
to
convey
the
true
color
,
texture
,
complexity
,
range
,
intensity
,
pulse
,
and
pitch
of
the
original
.
Any
alteration
of
one
of
these
factors
is
distortion
,
although
we
generally
use
that
word
only
for
effects
so
pronounced
that
they
can
be
stated
quantitatively
on
the
basis
of
standard
tests
.
Yet
it
is
the
accumulation
of
distortion
,
the
fitting
together
of
fractional
bits
until
the
total
reaches
the
threshold
of
our
awareness
,
that
makes
records
sound
like
records
.
The
sound
may
be
good
;
but
if
you
know
The
Real_Thing
,
you
know
that
what
you
are
hearing
is
only
a
clever
imitation
.
Command
's
new
Brahms
Second
is
a
major
effort
to
make
a
record
that
sounds
like
a
real
orchestra
rather
than
a
copy
of
one
.
Like
the
recent
Scheherazade
from
London
(
High_Fidelity
,
Sept.
1961
)
,
it
is
successful
because
emphasis
has
been
placed
on
good
musical
and
engineering
practices
rather_than
on
creating
sensational
effects
.
Because
of
this
,
only
those
with
truly
fine
equipment
will
be
able
to
appreciate
the
exact
degree
of
the
engineers
'
triumph
.
The
easiest
way
to
describe
this
release
is
to
say
that
it
reproduces
an
interesting
and
effective
Steinberg
performance
with
minimal
alteration
of
its
musical
values
.
The
engineering
as_such
never
obtrudes_upon
your
consciousness
.
The
effect
of
the
recording
is
very
open
and
natural
,
with
the
frequency
emphasis
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
live
performance
.
This
absence
of
peaky
highs
and
beefed-up
bass
not_only
produces
greater
fidelity
,
but
it
eliminates
listener
fatigue
.
A
contributing
factor
is
the
perspective
,
the
uniform
aesthetic
distance
which
is
maintained
.
The
orchestra
is
far
enough
away
from
you
that
you
miss
the
bow
scrapes
,
valve
clicks
,
and
other
noises
incidental_to
playing
.
Yet
you
feel
the
orchestra
is
near
at_hand
,
and
the
individual
instruments
have
the
same
firm
presence
associated
with
listening
from
a
good
seat
in
an
acoustically
perfect
hall
.
Command
has
achieved
the
ideal
amount
of
reverberation
.
The
music
is
always
allowed
the
living_space
needed
to
attain
its
full
sonority
;
yet
the
hall
never
intrudes
as
a
quasi
performer
.
The
timbre
remains
that
of
the
instruments
unclouded
by
resonance
.
All_of
this
would
be
wasted
,
of_course
,
if
the
performance
lacked
authority
and
musical
distinction
.
For
me
it
has
more
of
both
elements
than
the
majority
of
its
competitors
.
Steinberg
seems
to
have
gone
directly
back
to
the
score
,
discounting
tradition
,
and
has
built
his
performance
on
the
intention
to
reproduce
as
faithfully
as
possible
exactly
what
Brahms
set_down
on_paper
.
Those
accustomed
to
broader
,
more
romantic
statements
of
the
symphony
can
be
expected
to
react
strongly
when
they
hear
this
one
.
Without
losing
the
distinctive
undertow
of
Brahmsian
rhythm
,
the
pacing
is
firm
and
the
over-all
performance
has
a
tightly_knit
quality
that
makes_for
maximum
cumulative
effect
.
The
Presto
ma_non_assai
of
the
first
trio
of
the
scherzo
is
taken
literally
and
may
shock
you
,
as
the
real
Allegro_con_spirito
of
the
finale
is
likely
to
bring
you
to
your
feet
.
In_the_end
,
however
,
the
thing
about
this
performance
that
is
most
striking
is
the
way
it
sings
.
Steinberg
obviously
has
concluded
that
it
is
the
lyric
element
which
must
dominate
in
this
score
,
and
he
manages
at_times
to
create
the
effect
of
the
whole
orchestra
bursting
into
song
.
The
engineering
provides
exactly
the
support
needed
for
such
a
result
.
Too
many
records
seem
to
reduce
a
work
of
symphonic
complexity
to
a
melody
and
its
accompaniment
.
The
Command
technique
invites
you
to
listen
to
the
depth
of
the
orchestration
.
Your
ear
takes
you
into
the
ensemble
,
and
you
may
well
become
aware
of
instrumental
details
which
previously
were
apparent
only
in
the
score
.
It
is
this
sort
of
experience
that
makes
the
concept
of
high_fidelity
of
real
musical
significance
for
the
home
music
listener
.
The
first
substantially
complete
stereo
Giselle
(
and
the
only
one
of
its
scope
since
Feyer
's
four-sided
LP
edition
of
1958
for
Angel
)
,
this
set
is
,
I'm
afraid
,
likely
to
provide
more
horrid
fascination
than
enjoyment
.
The
already
faded
pastel
charms
of
the
naive
music
itself
vanish
entirely
in
Fistoulari
's
melodramatic
contrasts
between
ultra
vehement
brute
power
and
chilly
,
if
suave
,
sentimentality
.
And
in
its
engineers
'
frantic
attempts
to
achieve
maximum
dynamic
impact
and
earsplitting
brilliance
,
the
recording
sounds
as
though
it
had
been
``
doctored
for
super
high_fidelity
''
.
The
home
listener
is
overpowered
,
all_right
,
but
the
experience
is
a
far
from
pleasant
one
.
As
with
the
penultimate
Giselle
release
(
Wolff
's
abridgment
for
RCA_Victor
)
I
find
the
cleaner
,
less
razor
edged
monophonic
version
,
for
all
its
lack
of
big
stage
spaciousness
,
the
more
aurally
tolerable
-
but
this
may
be
the
result
of
processing
defects
in
my
SD
copies
.
