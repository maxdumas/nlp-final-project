Franklin_D._Lee
proved
a
man
of
prompt
action
when
Mrs._Claire_Shaefer
,
accompanied
by
a
friend
,
visited
him
in
Bakersfield
,
California
,
several
months
ago
as
a
prospective
patient
.
``
Doctor
''
Lee
asked
her
to
lie_down
on
a
bed
and
remove
her
shoes
.
Then
,
by
squeezing
her
foot
three
times
,
he
came_up
-
presto
-
with
a
different
diagnosis
with
each
squeeze
.
She
had
-
he
informed
her
-
kidney
trouble
,
liver
trouble
,
and
a
severe
female
disorder
.
(
He
explained
that
he
could
diagnose
these
ailments
from
squeezing
her
foot
because
all_of
the
nervous_system
was
connected
to
it
.
)
He
knew
just
the
thing
for
her
-
a
treatment
from
his
``
cosmic
light
ozone
generator
''
machine
.
As
he
applied
the
applicator
extending
from
the
machine
-
which
consisted_of
seven
differently
colored
neon_tubes
superimposed
on
a
rectangular
base
-
to
the
supposedly
diseased
portions
of
Mrs._Shaefer
's
body
,
Lee
kept_up
a
steady
stream
of
pseudo
scientific
mumbo-jumbo
.
Yes
,
the
ozone
from
his
machine
would
cure
practically
everything
,
he
assured
her
.
Did
she
know
,
he
asked
,
why
the
colors
of
the
tubes
were
important
to
people
's
health
?
The
human_body
-
he
pointed_out
,
for_example
-
required
33
units
of
blue
light
.
For
that
reason
,
he
informed
her
,
the
Lord
made
the
sky
blue
.
Continuing
glibly
in
this
vein
,
he
paused
to
comfort
her
:
``
Do
n't
you
worry
.
This
machine
will
cure
your
cancer
ridden
body
''
.
``
Cancer
''
!
Mrs._Shaefer
practically
shrieked
.
``
You
did
n't
tell
me
I
had
cancer
''
.
``
You
have
it
,
all_right
.
But
as_long_as
you
can
have
treatment
from
my
machine
you
have
nothing
to
worry
about
.
Why
,
I
once
used
this
machine
to
cure
a
woman
with
97
pounds
of
cancer
in
her
body
''
.
He
urged
her
to
buy
one
of
his
machines
-
for
$
300
.
When
she
said
that
she
did
n't
have
the
money
,
he
said
that
she
could
come_in
for
treatment
with
his
office
model
until
she
was
ready
to
buy
one
.
He
then
sold
her
minerals
to
cure
her
kidney
ailment
,
a
can
of
sage
``
to
make
her
look_like
a
girl
again
''
,
and
an
application
of
plain
mud
to
take
her
wrinkles
away
.
Lee
renewed
his
pressure
on
Mrs._Shaefer
to
buy
his
machine
when
she
visited
him
the
next
day
.
After
another
treatment
with
the
machine
,
he
told
her
that
``
her
entire
body
was
shot_through
with
tumors
and
cysts
''
.
He
then
sold
her
some
capsules
that
he
asserted
would
take_care
of
the
tumors
and
cysts
until
she
could
collect
the
money
for
buying
his
machine
.
When
she
submitted
to
his
treatment
with
the
capsules
,
Mrs._Shaefer
felt
intense
pain
.
Leaving
Lee
's
office
,
Mrs._Shaefer
hurried
over
to
her
family
physician
,
who
treated
her
for
burned
tissue
.
For
several
days
,
she
was
ill
as
a
result
of
Lee
's
treatment
.
Mrs._Shaefer
never
got_around_to
joining
the
thousand
or_so
people
who
paid
Lee
some
$
30000
for
his
ozone
machines
.
For
Mrs._Shaefer
-
who
had
been
given
a
clean
bill_of_health
by
her
own
physician
at
the
time
she
visited
Lee
-
and
her
friend
were
agents
for
the
California_Pure_Food
and
Drug_Inspection_Bureau
.
And
she
felt
amply
rewarded
for
her
suffering
when
the
evidence
of
Lee
's
quack
shenanigans
,
gathered
by
the
tape_recorder
under
her
friend
's
clothing
,
proved
adequate
in
court
for
convicting
Franklin_D._Lee
.
The
charge
:
violation
of
the
California
Medical_Practices
Act
by
practicing
medicine
without
a
license
and
selling
misbranded
drugs
.
The
sentence
:
360
days
'
confinement
in
the
county
jail
.
An
isolated
case
of
quackery
?
By_no_means
.
Rather
,
it
is
typical
of
the
thousands
of
quacks
who
use
phony
therapeutic
devices
to
fatten
themselves
on
the
miseries
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
Americans
by
robbing
them
of
millions
of
dollars
and
luring
them
away
from
legitimate
,
ethical
medical
treatment
of
serious
diseases
.
The
machine
quack
makes
his
Rube_Goldberg
devices
out
of
odds_and_ends
of
metals
,
wires
,
and
radio
parts
.
With
these
gadgets
-
impressive
to
the
gullible
because
of
their
flashing
light_bulbs
,
ticks
,
and
buzzes
-
he
then
carries_out
a
vicious
medical
con_game
,
capitalizing
on
people
's
respect
for
the
electrical
and
atomic
wonders
of
our
scientific
age
.
He
milks
the
latest
scientific
advances
,
translating
them
into
his
own
special
Buck_Rogers
vocabulary
to
huckster
his
fake
machines
as
a
cure-all
for
everything
from
hay_fever
to
sexual
impotence
and
cancer
.
The
gadget
faker
operates
or
sells
his
phony
machines
for
$
5
to
$
10000
-
anything
the
traffic
will
bear
.
He
may
call
himself
a
naprapath
,
a
physiotherapist
,
an
electrotherapist
,
a
naturopath
,
a
sanipractor
,
a
medical
cultist
,
a
masseur
,
a
``
doctor
''
-
or
what
have
you
.
Not_only
do
these
quacks
assume
impressive
titles
,
but
represent
themselves
as
being
associated
with
various
scientific
or
impressive
foundations
-
foundations
which
often
have
little
more
than
a
letterhead
existence
.
The
medical
device
pirate
of
today
,
of_course
,
is
a
far
more
sophisticated
operator
than
his
predecessor
of
yesteryear
-
the
gallus
snapping
hawker
of
snake_oil
and
other
patent_medicines
.
His
plunder
is
therefore
far
higher
-
running
into
hundreds
of
millions
.
According_to
the
Food_and_Drug_Administration
(
FDA
)
,
``
Doctor
''
Ghadiali
,
Dr._Albert_Abrams
and
his
clique
,
and
Dr._Wilhelm_Reich
-
to
name
three
notorious
device
quacks
-
succeeded
,
respectively
,
in
distributing
10000
,
5000
,
and
2000
fake
health
machines
.
Authorities
believe
that
many_of
the
Doctor
Frauds
using
these
false
health
gadgets
are
still
in
business
.
Look_at
the
sums
paid
by
two
device
quack
victims
in
Cleveland
.
Sarah_Gross
,
a
dress_shop
proprietor
,
paid
$
1020
to
a
masseur
,
and
Mr._A.
,
a
laborer
,
paid
$
4200
to
a
chiropractor
for
treatment
with
two
fake
health
machines
-
the
``
radioclast
''
and
the
``
diagnometer
''
.
Multiply
these
figures
by
the
millions
of
people
known
to
be
conned
by
medical
pirates
annually
.
You
will
come_up
with
a
frightening
total
.
That
's
why
the
FDA
,
the
American_Medical_Association
(
AMA
)
,
and
the
National_Better_Business_Bureau
(
BBB
)
have
estimated
the
toll
of
mechanical
quackery
to
be
a
substantial
portion
of
the
$
610
million
or_so
paid
to
medical
charlatans
annually
.
The
Postmaster_General
recently
reported
that
mail_order
frauds
-
among
which
fake
therapeutic
devices
figure
prominently
-
are
at
the
highest
level
in
history
.
Similarly
,
the
American_Cancer_Society
(
ACS
)
,
the
Arthritis_and_Rheumatism_Foundation
,
and
the
BBB
have
each
stated
lately
that
medical
quackery
is
at
a
new
high
.
For_example
,
the
BBB
has
reported
it
was
receiving
four_times
as
many
inquiries
about
quack
devices
and
10
times
as_many
complaints
compared
with
two
years
ago
.
Authorities
hesitate
to
quote
exact
figures
,
however
,
believing
that
any
sum
they
come_up
with
is
only
a
surface
manifestation
-
turned_up
by
their
inevitably
limited
policing
-
of
the
real
loot
of
the
medical
racketeer
.
In
this
sense
,
authorities
believe
that
all
estimates
of
phony
device
quackery
are
conservative
.
The
economic
toll
that
the
device
quack
extracts
is
important
,
of_course
.
But
it
is
our
health
-
more
precious
than
all
the
money
in
the
world
-
that
these
modern
witch_doctors
with
their
fake
therapeutic
gadgets
are
gambling
away
.
By
preying
on
the
sick
,
by
playing
callously
on
the
hopes
of
the
desperate
,
by
causing
the
sufferer
to
delay
proper
medical_care
,
these
medical
ghouls
create
pain
and
misery
by
their
very
activity
.
Typically
,
Sarah_Gross
and
Mr._A
both
lost
more
than
their
money
as
the
result
of
their
experiences
with
their
Cleveland
quacks
.
Sarah_Gross
found
that
the
treatments
given
her
for
a
nervous
ailment
by
the
masseur
were
not
helping
her
.
As
a
result
,
she
consulted
medical
authorities
and
learned
that
the
devices
her
quack
``
doctor
''
was
using
were
phony
.
She
suffered
a
nervous_breakdown
and
had
to
be
institutionalized
.
Mr._A.
,
her
fellow
townsman
,
also
experienced
a
nervous_breakdown
just
as_soon_as
he
discovered
that
he
had
been
bilked
of
his
life
savings
by
the
limited
practitioner
who
had
been
treating
his
wife
-
a
woman
suffering
from
an
incurable
disease
,
multiple_sclerosis
-
and
himself
.
Mr._A
has
recovered
,
but
he
is
,
justifiably
,
a
bitter
man
.
``
That
's
a
lot
of
hard
earned
money
to
lose
''
,
he
says
today
.
``
Neither
me
nor
my
wife
were
helped
by
that
chiropractor
's
treatments
''
.
And
there
was
the
case
of
Tom_Hepker
,
a
machinist
,
who
was
referred
by
a
friend
to
a
health
machine
quack
who
treated
him
with
a
so-called
diagnostic
machine
for
what
Doctor_Fraud
said
was
a
system
full
of
arsenic
and
strychnine
.
After
his
pains
got_worse
,
Tom
decided
to
see
a
real
doctor
,
from
whom
he
learned
he
was
suffering
from
cancer
of
the
lung
.
Yes
,
Tom
caught
it
in_time
to
stay
alive
.
But
he
's
a
welfare_case
now
-
a
human
wreck
-
thanks
to
this
modern
witch_doctor
.
But
the
machine
quack
can
cause
far
more
than
just
suffering
.
In
such
diseases
as
cancer
,
tuberculosis
,
and
heart_disease
,
early
diagnosis
and
treatment
are
so
vital
that
the
waste_of_time
by
the
patient
with
Doctor_Fraud
's
cure-all
gadget
can
prove
fatal
.
Moreover
,
the
diabetic
patient
who
relies_on
cure
by
the
quack
device
and
therefore
cuts_off
his
insulin
intake
can
be
committing
suicide
.
For_instance
:
In
Chicago
,
some
time
ago
,
Mr._H.
,
age
27
,
a
diabetic
since
he
was
six
,
stopped
using
insulin
because
he
had
bought
a
``
magic
spike
''
-
a
glass
tube
about
the
size
of
a
pencil
filled
with
barium
chloride
worth
a
small
fraction
of
a
cent
-
sold
by
the
Vrilium_Company
of
Chicago
for
$
306
as
a
cure-all
.
``
Hang
this
around
your
neck
or
attach
it
to
other
parts
of
your
anatomy
,
and
its
rays
will
cure
any
disease
you
have
''
,
said
the
company
.
Mr._H.
is
dead
today
because
he
followed
this
advice
.
Doris_Hull
,
suffering
from
tuberculosis
,
was
taken
by
her
husband
to
see
Otis_G._Carroll
,
a
sanipractor
-
a
licensed
drugless
healer
-
in
Spokane
.
Carroll
diagnosed
Mrs._Hull
by
taking
a
drop
of
blood
from
her
ear
and
putting
it
on
his
``
radionic
''
machine
and
twirling
some
knobs
(
fee
$
50
)
.
His
prescription
:
hot
and
cold
compresses
to
increase
her
absorption
of
water
.
Although
she
weighed
only
108
pounds
when
she
visited
him
,
Carroll
permitted
her
to
go
on
a
10
-
day
fast
in
which
she
took
nothing
but
water
.
Inevitably
,
Mrs._Hull
died
of
starvation
and
tuberculosis
,
weighing
60
pounds
.
Moreover
,
her
husband
and
child
contracted
T.B.
from
her
.
(
Small
wonder
a
Spokane
jury
awarded
the
husband
$
35823
for
his
wife
's
death
.
)
In
California
,
a_few
years
ago
,
a
ghoul
by
the
name
of
H._F._Bell
sold
electric
blankets
as
a
cure
for
cancer
.
He
did
this
by
the
charming
practice
of
buying_up
used
electric
blankets
for
$
5
to
$
10
from
survivors
of
patients
who
had
died
,
reconditioning
them
,
and
selling
them
at
$
185
each
.
When
authorities
convicted
him
of
practicing
medicine
without
a
license
(
he
got_off
with
a
suspended
sentence
of
three
years
because
of
his
advanced
age
of
77
)
,
one
of
his
victims
was
not
around
to
testify
:
He
was
dead
of
cancer
.
By_no_means
are
these
isolated
cases
.
``
Unfortunately
''
,
says
Chief_Postal_Inspector_David_H._Stephens
,
who
has
prosecuted
many
device
quacks
,
``
the
ghouls
who
trade
on
the
hopes
of
the
desperately
ill
often
cannot
be
successfully
prosecuted
because
the
patients
who
are
the
chief
witnesses
die
before
the
case
is
called_up
in
court
''
.
Death
!
Have
no_doubt
about
it
.
That
's
where
device
quackery
can
lead
.
The
evidence
shows
that
fake
therapeutic
machines
,
substituted
for
valid
medical
cures
,
have
hastened
the
deaths
of
thousands
.
Who
are
the
victims
of
the
device
quacks
?
Authorities
say
that
oldsters
are
a
prime
target
.
Says
Wallace_F._Jannsen
,
director
of
the
FDA
's
Division_of_Public_Information
:
``
Quacks
are
apt
to
direct
their
appeal
directly
to
older
people
,
or
to
sufferers
from
chronic
ailments
such_as
arthritis
,
rheumatism
,
diabetes
,
and
cancer
.
People
who
have
not
been
able
to
get
relief
from
regular
medical
doctors
are
especially
apt
to
be
taken_in
by
quacks
''
.
The
victims
of
the
quacks
are
frequently
poor
people
,
like
Mr._A.
,
who
scrape_up
their
life
savings
to
offer
as
a
sacrifice
to
Doctor_Fraud
's
avarice
.
They
are
often
ignorant
as_well_as
underprivileged
.
