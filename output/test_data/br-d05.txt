Furthermore
,
as
an
encouragement
to
revisionist
thinking
,
it
manifestly
is
fair
to
admit
that
any
fraternity
has
a
constitutional
right
to
refuse
to
accept
persons
it
dislikes
.
The
Unitarian
clergy
were
an
exclusive
club
of
cultivated
gentlemen
-
as
the
term
was
then
understood
in_the_Back
Bay
-
and
Parker
was
definitely
not
a
gentleman
,
either
in
theology
or
in
manners
.
Ezra_Stiles_Gannett
,
an
honorable
representative
of
the
sanhedrin
,
addressed
himself
frankly
to
the
issue
in
1845
,
insisting
that
Parker
should
not
be
persecuted
or
calumniated
and
that
in_this
republic
no
power
to
restrain
him
by
force
could
exist
.
Even_so
,
Gannett
judiciously
argued
,
the
Association
could
legitimately
decide
that
Parker
``
should
not
be
encouraged
nor
assisted
in
diffusing
his
opinions
by
those
who
differ
from
him
in
regard_to
their
correctness
''
.
We
today
are
not
entitled
to
excoriate
honest
men
who
believed
Parker
to
be
downright
pernicious
and
who
barred
their
pulpits
against
his
demand
to
poison
the
minds
of
their
congregations
.
One
can
even
argue
-
though
this
is
a
delicate
matter
-
that
every
justification
existed
for
their
returning
the
Public_Lecture
to
the
First_Church
,
and
so
to
suppress
it
,
rather_than
let
Parker
use
it
as
a
sounding_board
for
his
propaganda
when
his
turn
should
come
to
occupy
it
.
Finally
,
it
did
seem
clear
as
day
to
these
clergymen
,
as
Gannett
's
son
explained
in
the
biography
of
his
father
,
they
had
always
contended
for
the
propriety
of
their
claim
to
the
title
of
Christians
.
Their
demand
against
the
Calvinist_Orthodoxy
for
intellectual
liberty
had
never
meant
that
they
would
follow
``
free
inquiry
''
to
the
extreme
of
proclaiming
Christianity
a
``
natural
''
religion
.
Grant
all
this
-
still
,
when
modern
Unitarianism
and
the
Harvard_Divinity_School
recall
with
humorous
affection
the
insults
Parker
lavished
upon
them
,
or_else
argue
that
after_all
Parker
received
the
treatment
he
invited
,
they
betray
an
uneasy
conscience
.
Whenever
New_England
liberalism
is
reminded
of
the
dramatic
confrontation
of
Parker
and
the
fraternity
on
January
23
,
1843
-
while
it
may
defend
the
privilege
of
Chandler_Robbins
to
demand
that
Parker
leave
the
Association
,
while
it
may
plead
that
Dr._N._L._Frothingham
had
every
warrant
for
stating
,
``
The
difference
between
Trinitarians
and
Unitarians
is
a
difference
in
Christianity
;
the
difference
between
Mr._Parker
and
the
Association
is
a
difference
between
no
Christianity
and
Christianity
''
-
despite
these
supposed
conclusive
assurances
,
the
modern
liberal
heaves
repeatedly
a
sigh
of
relief
,
of
positive
thanksgiving
,
that
the
Association
never
quite
brought
itself
officially
to
expel
Parker
.
Had
it
done
so
,
the
blot
on
its
escutcheon
would
have
remained
indelible
,
nor
could
the
Harvard_Divinity_School
assemble
today
to
honor
Parker
's
insurgence
other_than
by
getting_down
on
its
collective
knees
and
crying
``
peccavi
''
.
Happily
for
posterity
,
then
,
the
Boston_Association
did
not
actually
command
Parker
to
leave
the
room
,
though
it
came
too_close
for
comfort
to
what
would
have
been
an
unforgivable
brutality
.
Fortunately
,
the
honor
of
the
denomination
can
attest
that
Cyrus_Bartol
defended
Parker
's
sincerity
,
as
did
also
Gannett
and
Chandler_Robbins
;
whereupon
Parker
broke_down
into
convulsions
of
weeping
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
,
though
not
out
of
the
Fellowship
.
In
the
hall
,
after
adjournment
,
Dr._Frothingham
took
him
warmly
by
the
hand
and
requested
Parker
to
visit
him
-
whereupon
our
burly
Theodore
again
burst
into
tears
.
All
this
near
tragedy
,
which
to
us
borders_on
comedy
,
enables
us
to
tell
the
story
over_and_over_again
,
always
warming
ourselves
with
a
glow
of
complacency
.
It
was
indeed
a
near
thing
,
but
somehow
the
inherent
decency
of
New_England
(
which
we
inherit
)
did
triumph
.
Parker
was
never
excommunicated
.
To
the
extent
that
he
was
ostracized
or
even
reviled
,
we
solace
ourselves
by
saying
he
asked_for
it
.
Yet
,
even
after_all
these
stratagems
,
the
conscience
of
Christian
liberality
is
still
not
laid_to_rest
,
any_more
than
is
the
conscience
of
Harvard_University
for
having
done
the
abject
penance
for
its
rejection
of
Ralph_Waldo_Emerson
's
The
Divinity_School_Address
of
naming
its
hall
of
philosophy
after
him
.
In
both
cases
the
stubborn
fact
remains
:
liberalism
gave_birth
to
two
brilliant
apostates
,
both
legitimate
offspring
of
its
loins
,
and
when
brought
to
the
test
,
it
behaved
shabbily
.
Suppose
they
both
had
ventured
into
realms
which
their
colleagues
thought
infidel
:
is
this
the
way
gentlemen
settle
frank
differences_of_opinion
?
Is
it
after_all
possible
that
no_matter_how
the
liberals
trumpet
their
confidence
in
human
dignity
they
are
exposed
to
a
contagion
of
fear
more
insidious
than
any
conservative
has
ever
to
worry
about
?
However
,
there
is
a
crucial
difference
between
the
two
histories
.
Emerson
evaded
the
problem
by
shoving
it
aside
,
or
rather
by
leaving
it
behind
him
:
he
walked_out_of
the
Unitarian
communion
,
so_that
it
could
lick
the
wound
of
his
departure
,
preserve
its
self-respect
and
eventually
accord
him
pious
veneration
.
Parker
insisted
upon
not
resigning
,
even
when
the
majority
wanted
him
to
depart
,
upon
daring
the
Fellowship
to
throw
him
out
.
Hence
he
was
in
his
lifetime
,
as
is
the
memory
of
him
afterwards
,
a
canker
within
the
liberal
sensitivity
.
He
still
points
an
accusing
finger
at_all
of
us
,
telling
us
we
have
neither
the
courage
to
support
him
nor
the
energy
to
cut
his
throat
.
Actually
,
the
dispute
between
Parker
and
the
society
of
his
time
,
both
ecclesiastical
and
social
,
was
a
real
one
,
a
bitter
one
.
It
cannot
be
smoothed_over
by
now
cherishing
his
sarcasms
as
delightful
bits
of
self-deprecation
or
by
solemnly
calling_for
a
reconsideration
of
the
justice
of
the
objections
to
him
.
The
fact
is
incontestable
:
that
liberal
world
of
Unitarian_Boston
was
narrow-minded
,
intellectually
sterile
,
smug
,
afraid_of
the
logical
consequences
of
its
own
mild
ventures
into
iconoclasm
,
and
quite
prepared
to
resort
to
hysterical
repressions
when
its
brittle
foundations
were
threatened
.
Parker
,
along
with
Garrison
and
Charles_Sumner
,
showed
a
magnificent
moral
bravery
when
facing
mobs
mobilized
in
defense
of
the
Mexican
War
and
slavery
.
Nevertheless
,
we
can
find
reasons
for
respecting
even
the
bigotry
of
the
populace
;
their
passions
were
genuine
,
and
the
division
between
them
and
the
abolitionists
is
clear-cut
.
But
Parker
as
the
ultra-liberal
minister
within
the
pale
of
a
church
which
had
proclaimed
itself
the
repository
of
liberality
poses
a
different
problem
,
which
is
not
to
be
resolved
by
holding
him
up
as
the
champion
of
freedom
.
Even_though
his
theological
theses
have
become
,
to
us
,
commonplaces
,
the
fundamental
interrogation
he
phrased
is
very_much
with
us
.
It
has
been
endlessly
rephrased
,
but
I
may
here
put
it
thus
:
at
what
point
do
the
tolerant
find
themselves
obliged
to
become
intolerant
?
And_then
,
as
they
become
aware
that
they
have
reached
the
end
of
their
patience
,
what
do
they
,
to
their
dismay
,
learn
for_the_first_time
about
themselves
?
There
can
be
no_doubt
,
the
Boston
of_that
era
could
be
exquisitely
cruel
in
enforcing
its
canons
of
behavior
.
The
gentle
Channing
,
revered
by
all
Bostonians
,
orthodox
or
Unitarian
,
wrote
to
a
friend
in
Louisville
that
among
its
many
virtues
Boston
did
not
abound_in
a
tolerant
spirit
,
that
the
yoke
of
opinion
crushed
individuality
of
judgment
and
action
:
``
No
city
in
the
world
is
governed
so
little
by
a
police
,
and
so_much
by
mutual
inspections
and
what
is
called
public
sentiment
.
We
stand
more
in_awe_of
one
another
than
most
people
.
Opinion
is
less
individual
or
runs
more
into
masses
,
and
often
rules
with
a
rod
of
iron
''
.
Even
more
poignantly
,
and
with
the
insight
of
a
genius
,
Channing
added
-
remember
,
this
is
Channing
,
not
Parker
!
-
that
should
a
minister
in
Boston
trust
himself
to
his
heart
,
should
he
``
speak
without
book
,
and
consequently
break
some
law
of
speech
,
or
be
hurried
into
some
daring
hyperbole
,
he
should
find
little
mercy
''
.
Channing
wrote
this
-
in
a
letter
!
I
think
it
fair
to
say
that
he
never
quite
reached
such
candor
in
his
sermons
.
But
Theodore_Parker
,
commencing
his
mission
to
the
world-at-large
,
disguised
as
the
minister
of
a
``
twenty-eighth
Congregational_Church
''
which
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
Congregational
polities
descended
from
the
founders
(
among
which
were
still
the
Unitarian
churches
)
,
made
explicit
from_the_beginning
that
the
conflict
between
him
and
the
Hunkerish
society
was
not
something
which
could
be
evaporated
into
a
genteel
difference
about
clerical
decorum
.
Because
he
spoke
openly
with
what
Channing
had
prophesied
someone
might
-
with
daring
hyperbole
-
Parker
vindicated
Channing
's
further
prophecy
that
he
who
committed
this
infraction
of
taste
would
promptly
discover
how
little
mercy
liberals
were
disposed
to
allow
to
libertarians
who
appeared
to
them
libertines
.
An
institutionalized
liberalism
proved
itself
fundamentally
an
institution
,
and
only
within
those
defined
limits
a
license
.
By
reminding
ourselves
of
these
factors
in
the
situation
,
we
should
,
I
am
sure
,
come_to
a
fresh
realization
,
however
painful
it
be
,
that
the
battle
between
Parker
and
his
neighbors
was
fought
in_earnest
.
He
arraigned
the
citizens
in
language
of
so
little
courtesy
that
they
had
to
respond
with
,
at_the_least
,
resentment
.
What
otherwise
could
``
the
lawyer
,
doctor
,
minister
,
the
men_of_science
and
letters
''
do
when
told
that
they
had
``
become
the
cherubim
and
seraphim
and
the
three
archangels
who
stood
before
the
golden
throne
of
the
merchant
,
and
continually
cried
,
'
Holy
,
holy
,
holy
is
the
Almighty
Dollar
''
'
?
Nor
,
when
we
recollect
how
sensitive
were
the
emotions
of
the
old
Puritan
stock
in
regard_to
the
recent
tides
of
immigration
,
should
we
be
astonished
that
their
thin
lips
were
compressed
into
a
white_line
of
rage
as
Parker
snarled
at
them
thus
:
``
Talk_about
the
Catholics
voting
as
the
bishop
tells
!
reproach
the
Catholics
for
it
!
You
and
I
do
the
same
thing
.
There
are
a
great
many
bishops
who
have
never
had
a
cross
on
their
bosom
,
nor
a
mitre
on
their
head
,
who
appeal
not
to
the
authority
of
the
Pope
at
Rome
,
but
to
the
Almighty
Dollar
,
a
pope
much
nearer
home
.
Boston
has
been
controlled
by
a_few
capitalists
,
lawyers
and
other
managers
,
who
told
the
editors
what
to
say
and
the
preachers
what
to
think
''
.
This
was
war
.
Parker
meant_business
.
And
he
took
repeated
care
to
let
his
colleagues
know
that
he
intended
them
:
``
Even
the
Unitarian
churches
have
caught
the
malaria
,
and
are
worse
than
those
who
deceived
them
''
-
which
implied
that
they
were
very
bad
indeed
.
It
was
``
Duty
''
he
said
that
his
parents
had
given
him
as
a
rule
-
beyond
even
the
love
that
suffused
his
being
and
the
sense_of_humor
with
which
he
was
largely
supplied
-
and
it
was
duty
he
would
perform
,
though
it
cost
him
acute
pain
and
exhausted
him
by
the
age
of
fifty
.
Parker
could
weep
-
and
he
wept
astonishingly
often
and
on
the
slightest
provocation
-
but
the
psychology
of
those
tears
was
entirely
compatible
with
a
remorseless
readiness
to
massacre
his
opponents
.
``
If
it
gave
me
pleasure
to
say
hard
things
''
,
he
wrote
,
``
I
would
shut_up
forever
''
.
We
have
to
tell
ourselves
that
when
Parker
spoke
in_this
vein
,
he
believed
what
he
said
,
because
he
could
continue
,
``
But
the
truth
,
which
cost
me
bitter
tears
to
say
,
I
must
speak
,
though
it
cost
other
tears
hotter
than
fire
''
.
Because
he
copiously
shed
his
own
tears
,
and
yielded
himself
up
as
a
living
sacrifice
to
the
impersonalized
conscience
of
New_England
,
he
was
not
disturbed
by
the
havoc
he
worked
in
other
people
's
consciences
.
Our
endeavor
to
capture
even
a
faint
sense
of
how
strenuous
was
the
fight
is
muffled
by
our
indifference
to
the
very
issue
which
in
the
Boston
of
1848
seemed
to
be
the
central
hope
of
its
Christian
survival
,
that
of
the
literal
,
factual
historicity
of
the
miracles
as
reported
in
the
Four
Gospels
.
It
is
idle
to
ask
why
we
are
no_longer
disturbed
if
somebody
,
professing
the
deepest
piety
,
decides
anew
that
it
is
of
no
importance
whether
or
not
Christ
transformed
the
water
into
wine
at
eleven
A._M.
on
the
third
of
August
,
A._D.
32
.
We
have
no
answer
as
to
why
we
are
not
alarmed
.
So
we
are
the
more
prepared
to
give
Parker
the
credit
for
having
taken
the
right
side
in
an
unnecessary
controversy
,
to
salute
his
courage
,
and
to
pass_on
,
happily
forgetting
both
him
and
the
entire
episode
.
We
have
not
the
leisure
,
or
the
patience
,
or
the
skill
,
to
comprehend
what
was
working
in_the_mind
and
heart
of
a
then
recent
graduate
from
the
Harvard_Divinity_School
who
would
muster
the
audacity
to
contradict
his
most
formidable
instructor
,
the
majesterial
Andrews_Norton
,
by
saying
that
,
while
he
believed
Jesus
``
like
other
religious
teachers
''
,
worked
miracles
,
``
I
see
not
how
a
miracle
proves
a
doctrine
''
.
