Had
a
funny
experience
at
Newport
yesterday
afternoon
.
Sat
there
and
as
a
woman
sang
,
she
kept
getting
thinner
and
thinner
,
right
before
my
eyes
,
and
the
eyes
of
some
5500
other
people
.
I
make
this
observation
about
the
lady
,
Miss_Judy_Garland
,
because
she
brought_up
the
subject
herself
in
telling
a
story
about
a
British
female
reporter
who
flattered
her
terribly
in
London
recently
and_then
wrote
in
the
paper
the
next
day
:
``
Judy_Garland
has
arrived
in
London
.
She
's
not
chubby
.
She
's
not
plump
.
She
's
fat
''
.
But
who
cares
,
when
the
lady
sings
?
Certainly
not
the
largest
afternoon
audience
Newport
has
ever
had
at
a
jazz
concert
and
the_most
attentive
and
quiet
.
They
applauded
every
number
,
not_only
at
its
conclusion
but
also
at
the
first
statement
of
the
theme
-
sometimes
at
the
first
chord
.
And
Judy
sang
the
lovely
old
familiar
things
which
seemed
,
at_times
,
a
blessed
relief
from
the
way-out
compositions
of
the
progressive
jazzmen
who
have
dominated
these
proceedings
.
Things
like
``
When_You're_Smiling
''
,
``
Almost_Like_Being_In_Love
''
,
``
Do_It_Again
''
,
``
Born_to_Wander
''
,
``
Alone
Together
''
,
``
Who_Cares
?
''
,
``
Puttin
'
on
the
Ritz
''
,
``
How_Long_Has_This_Been_Going_On
?
''
and
her
own
personal
songs
like
``
The_Man_That_Got_Away
''
,
and
the
inevitable
``
Over
the
Rainbow
''
.
Miss_Garland
is
not_only
one
of
the
great
singers
of
our
time
but
she
is
one
of
the
superb
showmen
.
At_the_start
of
her
program
there
were
evidences
of
pique
.
She
had
held
to
the
letter
of
her
contract
and
did
n't
come
onto
the
stage
until
well
after
4
p.
m.
,
the
appointed
hour
,
although
the
Music
at
Newport
people
had
tried
to
get
the
program
underway
at
3
.
Then
there
was
a
bad
delay
in
getting
Mort_Lindsey
's
30
-
piece
orchestra
wedged
into
its
chairs
.
Along
about
4
:
30
,
just
when
it
was
getting_to
be
about
time
to
turn
the
audience
over
and
toast
them
on
the
other
side
,
Judy
came_on
singing
,
in
a
short-skirted
blue
dress
with
a
blue
and
white
jacket
that
flapped
in
the
wind
.
Her
bouffant
coiffure
was
fortunately
combed
on_the_left
which
happened
to
be
the
direction
from
which
a
brisk
breeze
was
blowing
.
In
her
first
song
she
waved
away
one
encroaching
photographer
who
dared
approach
the
throne
unbidden
and
thereafter
the
boys
with
the
cameras
had_to
unsheathe
their
300
mm.
lenses
and
shoot
at
extreme
range
.
There
also
came
a
brief
contretemps
with
the
sound
mixers
who
made
the
mistake
of
being
overheard
during
a
quiet
moment
near
the
conclusion
of
``
Do_It_Again
''
,
and
she
made
the
tart
observation
that
``
I
never
saw
so_much
moving
about
in
an
audience
''
.
But
it
did
n't
take
Judy_Garland
,
showman
,
long
to
realize
that
this
sort_of
thing
was
par
for
the
course
at
Newport
and
that
you
have_to
learn
to
live
with_it
.
Before
her
chore
was
finished
she
was
rescuing
wind-blown
sheets
of
music
,
trundling
microphones
about
the
stage
,
helping
to
move
the
piano
and
otherwise
joining
in
the
informal
atmosphere
.
And
time
after
time
she
really
belted_out
her
songs
.
Sometimes
they
struck
me
as
horribly
over-arranged
-
which
was
the
way
I
felt
about
her
``
Come_Rain_or_Come_Shine
''
-
and
sometimes
they
were
just
plain
magnificent
,
like
her
shatteringly
beautiful
``
Beautiful
Weather
''
.
To
her
partisan
audience
,
such
picayune
haggling
would
have
seemed
nothing
more_than
a
critic
striving
to
hold
his
franchise
;
they
just
sat_back
on
their
haunches
and
cried
for
more
,
as
though
they
could
never
get
enough
.
They
were
rewarded
with
splendid
,
exciting
,
singing
.
Her
``
Rockabye
Your
Baby
''
was
as_good_as
it
can
be
done
,
and
her
really
personal
songs
,
like
``
The_Man_That_Got_Away
''
were
deeply
moving
.
The
audience
would
n't
let
her
leave
until
it
had
heard
``
Over
The
Rainbow
''
-
although
the
fellow
that
kept
crying
for
``
Get_Happy
''
had_to
go_home
unhappy
,
about
that
item
anyway
.
She
was
generous
with
her
encores
and
the
audience
was
equally
so
with
its
cheers
and
applause
and
flowers
.
All
went_home
happy
except
the
Newport
police
,
who
feared
that
the
throng
departing
at
6
:
35
might
meet
head-on
the
night
crowd
drawing
nigh
,
and
those
deprived_of
their
happy_hour
at
the
cocktail
bar
.
In
Newport
last
night
there
were
flashes
of
distant
lightning
in
the
northern
skies
.
This
was
perhaps
symbolic
of
the
jazz
of
the
evening
-
flashes
in
the
distance
,
but
no
storm
.
Several_times
it
came_near
breaking
,
and
there
were
in_fact
some
lovely
peals
of
thunder
from
Jerry_Mulligan
's
big_band
,
which
is
about
as
fine
an
aggregation
as
has
come_along
in
the
jazz
business
since
John_Hammond
found
Count_Basie
working
in
a
Kansas_City
trap
.
Mulligan
's
band
has
been
infected
with
his
solid
sense
of
swing
,
and
what
it
does
seems
far
more
meaningful
than
most_of
the
noise
generated
by
the
big
concert
aggregations
.
But
what
is
equally
impressive
is
the
delicacy
and
wonderful
lyric
quality
of
both
the
band
and
Mulligan
's
baritone
sax
in
a
fragile
ballad
like
Bob_Brookmeyer
's
arrangement
of
``
Django
's
Castle
''
.
For
subtle
swinging
rhythms
,
I
could
admire
intensely
Mulligan
's
version
of
``
Weep
''
,
and
the
fireworks
went
on
display
in
``
18
Carrots
for
Robert
''
,
a
sax
tribute
to
Johnny_Hodges
.
There
was
considerable
contrast
between
this
Mulligan
performance
and
that
of
Art_Blakey
and
The
Jazz
Messengers
,
who
are
able_to
generate
a
tremendous
sound
for
such
a
small
group
.
Unfortunately
,
Blakey
does
n't
choose
to
work
much
of
the
time
in_this
vein
.
He
prefers
to
have
his
soloist
performing
and
thus
we
get
only
brief
glimpses
of_what
his
ensemble
work
is
like
.
What
we
did
get
,
however
,
was
impressive
.
A_few
drops
of
rain
just
before
midnight
,
when
Sarah_Vaughan
was
in_the_midst
of
her
first
number
,
scattered
the
more
timid
members
of
the
audience
briefly
,
but
at
this
hour
and
with
Sarah
on
the
stand
,
most_of
the
listeners
did
n't
care
whether
they
got
wet
.
Miss_Vaughan
was
back
in
top
form
,
somehow
mellowed
and
improved
with
the
passage
of
time
-
like
a
fine
wine
.
After
the
spate
of
female
vocalists
we
have
been
having
,
all_of
whom
took
Sarah
as
a
point
of
departure
and_then
tried
to
see
what
they
could
do
that
might
make
her
seem
old
hat
,
it
seemed
that
all
that
has
happened
is
to
make
the
real_thing
seem
better
than
ever
.
The
evening
program
was
opened
by
the
Jazz
Three
,
a
Newport
group
consisting_of
Steve_Budieshein
on
bass
,
Jack_Warner
,
drums
,
and
Don_Cook
,
piano
.
This
was
a
continuation
of
a
good
idea
which
was
first
tried_out
Saturday
night
when
the
Eddie_Stack
group
,
also
local
talent
,
went
on
first
.
Putting_on
local
musicians
at_this_place
in
the
program
serves
a
triple
purpose
:
it
saves
the
top
flight
jazz
men
from
being
wasted
in_this
unenviable
spot
,
when
the
audience
is
cold
,
restless
,
and
in
flux
;
it
prevents
late-comers
from
missing
some
of
the
people
they
have
come
a
long
way
to
hear
,
and
it
gives
the
resident
musicians
a
chance
to
perform
before
the
famous
Newport
audience
.
The
Jazz
Three
displayed
their
sound
musicianship
,
not_only
in
their
own
chosen
set
,
but
as
the
emergency
accompanists
for
Al_Minns
+
Leon_James
,
the
superb
jazz
dancers
who
have
now
been
Newport
performers
for
three
successive
years
,
gradually
moving_up
from
a
morning
seminar
on
the
evolution
of
the_blues
to
a
spot
on
the
evening
program
.
Julie_Wilson
,
a
vigorous
vocalist
without
many
wild
twists
,
sang
a
set
,
a
large
part
of_which
consisted_of
such
seldom
heard
old
oldies
as
``
Hard-Hearted_Hannah
,
the
Vamp
of
Savannah
''
,
and
the
delightful
``
Sunday
''
.
She
frosted
the
cake
with
the
always
reliable
``
Bill_Bailey
''
.
From
this
taste
of
the
1920
s
,
we
leaped
way_out
to
Stan_Getz
's
private
brand
of
progressive
jazz
,
which
did
lovely
,
subtle
things
for
``
Baubles
,
Bangles
and
Beads
''
,
and
a_couple_of
ballards
.
Getz
is
a
difficult
musician
to
categorize
.
He
plays
his
sax
principally
for
beauty
of
tone
,
rather_than
for
scintillating
flights
of
meaningless
improvisations
,
and
he
has
a
quiet
way
of
getting_back
and
restating
the
melody
after
the
improvising
is
over
.
In_this
he
is
sticking_with
tradition
,
however
far
removed
from_it
he
may
seem
to
be
.
George_Shearing
took_over
with
his
well
disciplined
group
,
a
sextet
consisting_of
vibes
,
guitar
,
bass
,
drums
,
Shearing
's
piano
and
a
bongo
drummer
.
He
met
with
enthusiastic
audience
approval
,
especially
when
he
swung
from
jazz
to
Latin_American
things
like
the
Mambo
.
Shearing
,
himself
,
seemed
to
me
to
be
playing
better
piano
than
in
his
recent
Newport
appearances
.
A
very
casual
,
pleasant
program
-
one
of
those
easy-going
things
that
make
Newport
's
afternoon
programs
such
a
relaxing
delight
-
was
held
again
under
sunny
skies
,
hot
sun
,
and
a
fresh_breeze
for
an
audience
of
at_least
a_couple_of
thousands
who
came
to
Newport
to
hear
music
rather_than
go
to
the
beach
.
Divided
almost
equally
into
two
parts
,
it
consisted_of
``
The
Evolution
of
the_Blues
''
,
narrated
by
Jon_Hendricks
,
who
had
presented
it
last
year
at
the
Monterey
,
Calif.
,
Jazz_Festival
,
and
an
hour-long
session
of
Maynard_Ferguson
and
his
orchestra
,
a
blasting
big_band
.
Hendricks
'
story
was
designed
for
children
and
he
had
a
small
audience
of
small
children
right_on
stage
with
him
.
Tracing
the_blues
from
its
African
roots
among
the
slaves
who
were
brought
to
this
country
and
the
West_Indies
,
he
stressed
the
close
relationship
between
the
early
jazz
forms
and
the
music
of
the
Negro
churches
.
To
help
him
on
this
religious
aspect
of
primitive
jazz
he
had
``
Big
''
Miller
,
as
a
preacher-singer
and
Hannah_Dean
,
Gospel-singer
,
while
Oscar_Brown_Jr.
,
an
extremely
talented
young_man
,
did
a
slave
auctioneer
's
call
,
a
field-hands
'
work_song
,
and
a
beautifully
sung
Negro
lullaby
,
``
Brown_Baby
''
,
which
was
one
of
the
truly
moving
moments
of
the
festival
.
One
of
those
delightful
surprise
additions
,
which
so
frequently
occur
in
jazz
programs
,
was
an
excellent
stint
at
the
drums
by
the
great
Joe_Jones
,
drumming
to
``
Old_Man
River
''
,
which
seems
to
have
been
elected
the
favorite
solo
for
the
boys
on
the
batterie
at
this
year
's
concerts
.
Demonstrating
the
primitive
African
rhythmic
backgrounds
of
the_Blues
was
Michael_Babatunde_Olatunji
,
who
plays
such
native
drums
as
the
konga
and
even
does
a
resounding
job
slapping
his
own
chest
.
He
has
been
on
previous
Newport
programs
and
was
one
of
the
sensations
of
last
year
's
afternoon
concerts
.
Hendricks
had
Billy_Mitchell
,
tenor
sax
;
Pony_Poindexter
,
alto
sax
;
Jimmy_Witherspoon
,
blues
singer
(
and
a
good
one
)
,
and
the
Ike_Isaacs_Trio
,
which
has
done
such
wonderful
work
for
two
afternoons
now
,
helping
him
with
the
musical
examples
.
It
all
went
very_well
.
Pianists
who
are
serious
about
their
work
are
likely
to
know
the
interesting
material
contained
in
Schubert
's
Sonatas
.
Music_lovers
who
are
not
familiar_with
this
literature
may
hear
an
excellent
example
,
played
for
RCA
by
Emil_Gilels
.
He
has
chosen
Sonata_Op.
53
in
D
.
The
playing
takes
both
sides
of
the
disc
.
Perhaps
one
of
the
reasons
these
Sonatas
are
not
programmed
more_often
is
their
great
length
.
Rhythmic
interest
,
melodic
beauty
and
the
expansiveness
of
the
writing
are
all
qualities
which
hold
one
's
attention
with
the
Gilels
playing
.
His
technique
is
ample
and
his
musical
ideas
are
projected
beautifully
.
The
male
chorus
of
the
Robert_Shaw_Chorale
sings
Sea
Shanties
in
fine
style
.
The
group
is
superbly
trained
.
What
a
discussion
can
ensue
when
the
title
of_this
type
of
song
is
in_question
.
Do
you
say
chantey
,
as
if
the
word
were
derived
from
the_French
word
chanter
,
to
sing
,
or
do
you
say
shanty
and
think_of
a
roughly
built
cabin
,
which
derives
its
name
from
the
French-Canadian
use
of
the
word
chantier
,
with
one
of
its
meanings
given
as
a
boat-yard
?
I
say
chantey
.
Either
way
,
the
Robert_Shaw
chorus
sings
them
in
fine
style
with
every
colorful
word
and
its
musical
frame
spelled_out
in_terms_of
agreeable
listening
.
If
your
favorite
song
is
not
here
it
must
be
an
unfamiliar
one
.
The
London
label
offers
an
operatic
recital
by
Ettore_Bastianini
,
a
baritone
whose
fame
is
international
.
