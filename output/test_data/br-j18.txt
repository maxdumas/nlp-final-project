We
are
trying
to
study
a
linear_operator
T
on
the
finite
dimensional
space
V
,
by
decomposing
T
into
a
direct_sum
of
operators
which
are
in
some
sense
elementary
.
We
can
do
this
through
the
characteristic
values
and
vectors
of
T
in
certain
special
cases
,
i.e.
,
when
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
factors
over
the
scalar_field
F
into
a
product
of
distinct
monic_polynomials
of
degree
1
.
What
can
we
do
with
the
general
T
?
If
we
try
to
study
T
using
characteristic
values
,
we
are
confronted
with
two
problems
.
First
,
T
may
not
have
a
single
characteristic
value
;
this
is
really
a
deficiency
in
the
scalar_field
,
namely
,
that
it
is
not
algebraically
closed
.
Second
,
even
if
the
characteristic
polynomial
factors
completely
over
F
into
a
product
of
polynomials
of
degree
1
,
there
may
not
be
enough
characteristic
vectors
for
T
to
span
the
space
V
;
this
is
clearly
a
deficiency
in
T
.
The
second
situation
is
illustrated
by
the
operator
T
on
*
*
f
(
F
any
field
)
represented
in
the
standard
basis
by
*
*
f
.
The
characteristic
polynomial
for
A
is
*
*
f
and
this
is
plainly
also
the
minimal
polynomial
for
A
(
or
for
T
)
.
Thus
T
is
not
diagonalizable
.
One
sees
that
this
happens
because
the
null_space
of
*
*
f
has
dimension
1
only
.
On_the_other_hand
,
the
null_space
of
*
*
f
and
the
null_space
of
*
*
f
together
span
V
,
the
former
being
the
subspace
spanned
by
*
*
f
and
the
latter
the
subspace
spanned
by
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
.
This
will
be
more_or_less
our
general
method
for
the
second
problem
.
If
(
remember
this
is
an
assumption
)
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
decomposes
*
*
f
where
*
*
f
are
distinct
elements
of
F
,
then
we
shall
show
that
the
space
V
is
the
direct_sum
of
the
null_spaces
of
*
*
f
.
The
diagonalizable
operator
is
the
special
case
of
this
in
which
*
*
f
for
each
i
.
The
theorem
which
we
prove
is
more
general
than
what
we
have
described
,
since
it
works
with
the
primary
decomposition
of
the
minimal
polynomial
,
whether
or
not
the
primes
which
enter
are
all
of
first
degree
.
The
reader
will
find
it
helpful
to
think_of
the
special
case
when
the
primes
are
of
degree
1
,
and
even
more
particularly
,
to
think_of
the
proof
of
Theorem
10
,
a
special
case
of
this
theorem
.
Let
T
be
a
linear_operator
on
the
finite
dimensional
vector
space
V
over
the
field
F
.
Let
p
be
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
,
*
*
f
where
the
*
*
f
are
distinct
irreducible
monic_polynomials
over
F
and
the
*
*
f
are
positive
integers
.
Let
*
*
f
be
the
null_space
of
*
*
f
.
Then
(
a
)
*
*
f
(
b
)
each
*
*
f
is
invariant
under
T
(
c
)
if
*
*
f
is
the
operator
induced
on
*
*
f
by
T
,
then
the
minimal
polynomial
for
*
*
f
is
*
*
f
.
The
idea
of
the
proof
is
this
.
If
the
direct_sum
decomposition
(
a
)
is
valid
,
how
can
we
get
hold
of
the
projections
*
*
f
associated
with
the
decomposition
?
The
projection
*
*
f
will
be
the
identity
on
*
*
f
and
zero
on
the
other
*
*
f
.
We
shall
find
a
polynomial
*
*
f
such_that
*
*
f
is
the
identity
on
*
*
f
and
is
zero
on
the
other
*
*
f
,
and
so
that
*
*
f
,
etc.
.
For
each
i
,
let
*
*
f
.
Since
*
*
f
are
distinct
prime
polynomials
,
the
polynomials
*
*
f
are
relatively
prime
(
Theorem
8
,
Chapter
4
)
.
Thus
there
are
polynomials
*
*
f
such_that
*
*
f
.
Note
also
that
if
*
*
f
,
then
*
*
f
is
divisible_by
the
polynomial
p
,
because
*
*
f
contains
each
*
*
f
as
a
factor
.
We
shall
show
that
the
polynomials
*
*
f
behave
in
the
manner
described
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
proof
.
Let
*
*
f
.
Since
*
*
f
and
p
divides
*
*
f
for
*
*
f
,
we
have
*
*
f
.
Thus
the
*
*
f
are
projections
which
correspond
to
some
direct_sum
decomposition
of
the
space
V
.
We
wish
to
show
that
the
range
of
*
*
f
is
exactly
the
subspace
*
*
f
.
It
is
clear
that
each
vector
in
the
range
of
*
*
f
is
in
*
*
f
for
if
|a
is
in
the
range
of
*
*
f
,
then
*
*
f
and
so
*
*
f
because
*
*
f
is
divisible_by
the
minimal
polynomial
p
.
Conversely
,
suppose
that
|a
is
in
the
null_space
of
*
*
f
.
If
*
*
f
,
then
*
*
f
is
divisible_by
*
*
f
and
so
*
*
f
,
i.e.
,
*
*
f
.
But
then
it
is
immediate
that
*
*
f
,
i.e.
,
that
|a
is
in
the
range
of
*
*
f
.
This
completes
the
proof
of
statement
(
a
)
.
It
is
certainly
clear
that
the
subspaces
*
*
f
are
invariant
under
T
.
If
*
*
f
is
the
operator
induced
on
*
*
f
by
T
,
then
evidently
*
*
f
,
because
by
definition
*
*
f
is
0
on
the
subspace
*
*
f
.
This
shows
that
the
minimal
polynomial
for
*
*
f
divides
*
*
f
.
Conversely
,
let
g
be
any
polynomial
such_that
*
*
f
.
Then
*
*
f
.
Thus
*
*
f
is
divisible_by
the
minimal
polynomial
p
of
T
,
i.e.
,
*
*
f
divides
*
*
f
.
It
is
easily
seen
that
*
*
f
divides
g
.
Hence
the
minimal
polynomial
for
*
*
f
is
*
*
f
.
If
*
*
f
are
the
projections
associated
with
the
primary
decomposition
of
T
,
then
each
*
*
f
is
a
polynomial
in
T
,
and
accordingly
if
a
linear_operator
U
commutes
with
T
then
U
commutes
with
each
of
the
*
*
f
i.e.
,
each
subspace
*
*
f
is
invariant
under
U
.
In
the
notation
of
the
proof
of
Theorem
12
,
let
us
take_a_look
at
the
special
case
in
which
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
is
a
product
of
first
degree
polynomials
,
i.e.
,
the
case
in
which
each
*
*
f
is
of
the
form
*
*
f
.
Now
the
range
of
*
*
f
is
the
null_space
*
*
f
of
*
*
f
.
Let
us
put
*
*
f
.
By
Theorem
10
,
D
is
a
diagonalizable
operator
which
we
shall
call
the
diagonalizable
part
of
T
.
Let
us
look_at
the
operator
*
*
f
.
Now
*
*
f
*
*
f
so
*
*
f
.
The
reader
should
be
familiar
enough
with
projections
by
now
so
that
he
sees
that
*
*
f
and
in_general
that
*
*
f
.
When
*
*
f
for
each
i
,
we
shall
have
*
*
f
,
because
the
operator
*
*
f
will
then
be
0
on
the
range
of
*
*
f
.
Let
N
be
a
linear_operator
on
the
vector
space
V
.
We
say
that
N
is
nilpotent
if
there
is
some
positive
integer
r
such_that
*
*
f
.
Let
T
be
a
linear_operator
on
the
finite
dimensional
vector
space
V
over
the
field
F
.
Suppose
that
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
decomposes
over
F
into
a
product
of
linear
polynomials
.
Then
there
is
a
diagonalizable
operator
D
on
V
and
a
nilpotent
operator
N
on
V
such_that
(
a
)
*
*
f
,
(
b
)
*
*
f
.
The
diagonalizable
operator
D
and
the
nilpotent
operator
N
are
uniquely
determined
by
(
a
)
and
(
b
)
and
each
of
them
is
a
polynomial
in
T
.
We
have
just
observed
that
we
can
write
*
*
f
where
D
is
diagonalizable
and
N
is
nilpotent
,
and
where
D
and
N
not_only
commute
but
are
polynomials
in
T
.
Now
suppose
that
we
also
have
*
*
f
where
D
'
is
diagonalizable
,
N
'
is
nilpotent
,
and
*
*
f
.
We
shall
prove
that
*
*
f
.
Since
D
'
and
N
'
commute
with
one
another
and
*
*
f
,
we
see
that
D
'
and
N
'
commute
with
T
.
Thus
D
'
and
N
'
commute
with
any
polynomial
in
T
;
hence
they
commute
with
D
and
with
N
.
Now
we
have
*
*
f
or
*
*
f
and
all
four
of
these
operators
commute
with
one
another
.
Since
D
and
D
'
are
both
diagonalizable
and
they
commute
,
they
are
simultaneously
diagonalizable
,
and
*
*
f
is
diagonalizable
.
Since
N
and
N
'
are
both
nilpotent
and
they
commute
,
the
operator
*
*
f
is
nilpotent
;
for
,
using
the
fact
that
N
and
N
'
commute
*
*
f
and
so
when
r
is
sufficiently
large
every
term
in
this
expression
for
*
*
f
will
be
0
.
(
Actually
,
a
nilpotent
operator
on
an
n-dimensional
space
must
have
its
nth
power
0
;
if
we
take
*
*
f
above
,
that
will
be
large
enough
.
It
then
follows
that
*
*
f
is
large
enough
,
but
this
is
not
obvious
from
the
above
expression
.
)
Now
*
*
f
is
a
diagonalizable
operator
which
is
also
nilpotent
.
Such
an
operator
is
obviously
the
zero
operator
;
for
since
it
is
nilpotent
,
the
minimal
polynomial
for
this
operator
is
of
the
form
*
*
f
for
some
*
*
f
;
but
then
since
the
operator
is
diagonalizable
,
the
minimal
polynomial
cannot
have
a
repeated
root
;
hence
*
*
f
and
the
minimal
polynomial
is
simply
x
,
which
says
the
operator
is
0
.
Thus
we
see
that
*
*
f
and
*
*
f
.
Let
V
be
a
finite
dimensional
vector
space
over
an
algebraically
closed
field
F
,
e.g.
,
the
field
of
complex_numbers
.
Then
every
linear_operator
T
on
V
can
be
written
as
the
sum
of
a
diagonalizable
operator
D
and
a
nilpotent
operator
N
which
commute
.
These
operators
D
and
N
are
unique
and
each
is
a
polynomial
in
T
.
From
these
results
,
one
sees
that
the
study
of
linear_operators
on
vector
spaces
over
an
algebraically
closed
field
is
essentially
reduced
to
the
study
of
nilpotent
operators
.
For
vector
spaces
over
non
algebraically
closed
fields
,
we
still
need
to
find
some
substitute
for
characteristic
values
and
vectors
.
It
is
a
very
interesting
fact
that
these
two
problems
can
be
handled
simultaneously
and
this
is
what
we
shall
do
in
the
next
chapter
.
In
concluding
this
section
,
we
should_like
to
give
an
example
which
illustrates
some
of
the
ideas
of
the
primary
decomposition
theorem
.
We
have
chosen
to
give
it
at
the
end
of
the
section
since
it
deals
with
differential_equations
and
thus
is
not
purely
linear_algebra
.
In
the
primary
decomposition
theorem
,
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
vector
space
V
be
finite
dimensional
,
nor
is
it
necessary
for
parts
(
a
)
and
(
b
)
that
p
be
the
minimal
polynomial
for
T
.
If
T
is
a
linear_operator
on
an
arbitrary
vector
space
and
if
there
is
a
monic_polynomial
p
such_that
*
*
f
,
then
parts
(
a
)
and
(
b
)
of
Theorem
12
are
valid
for
T
with
the
proof
which
we
gave
.
Let
n
be
a
positive
integer
and
let
V
be
the
space
of
all
n
times
continuously
differentiable
functions
f
on
the
real
line
which
satisfy
the
differential_equation
*
*
f
where
*
*
f
are
some
fixed
constants
.
If
*
*
f
denotes
the
space
of
n
times
continuously
differentiable
functions
,
then
the
space
V
of
solutions
of
this
differential_equation
is
a
subspace
of
*
*
f
.
If
D
denotes
the
differentiation
operator
and
p
is
the
polynomial
*
*
f
then
V
is
the
null_space
of
the
operator
p
(
D
)
,
because
*
*
f
simply
says
*
*
f
.
Let
us
now
regard
D
as
a
linear_operator
on
the
subspace
V
.
Then
*
*
f
.
If
we
are
discussing
differentiable
complex
valued
functions
,
then
*
*
f
and
V
are
complex
vector
spaces
,
and
*
*
f
may
be
any
complex_numbers
.
We
now
write
*
*
f
where
*
*
f
are
distinct
complex_numbers
.
If
*
*
f
is
the
null_space
of
*
*
f
,
then
Theorem
12
says
that
*
*
f
.
In_other_words
,
if
f
satisfies
the
differential_equation
*
*
f
,
then
f
is
uniquely
expressible
in
the
form
*
*
f
where
*
*
f
satisfies
the
differential_equation
*
*
f
.
Thus
,
the
study
of
the
solutions
to
the
equation
*
*
f
is
reduced
to
the
study
of
the
space
of
solutions
of
a
differential_equation
of
the
form
*
*
f
.
This
reduction
has
been
accomplished
by
the
general
methods
of
linear_algebra
,
i.e.
,
by
the
primary
decomposition
theorem
.
To
describe
the
space
of
solutions
to
*
*
f
,
one
must
know
something
about
differential_equations
,
that_is
,
one
must
know
something
about
D
other_than
the
fact
that
it
is
a
linear_operator
.
However
,
one
does
not
need
to
know
very_much
.
It
is
very
easy
to
establish
by
induction
on
r
that
if
f
is
in
*
*
f
then
*
*
f
that_is
,
*
*
f
,
etc.
.
Thus
*
*
f
if
and
only
if
*
*
f
.
A
function
g
such_that
*
*
f
,
i.e.
,
*
*
f
,
must
be
a
polynomial
function
of
degree
*
*
f
or
less
:
*
*
f
.
Thus
f
satisfies
*
*
f
if
and
only
if
f
has
the
form
*
*
f
.
Accordingly
,
the
'
functions
'
*
*
f
span
the
space
of
solutions
of
*
*
f
.
Since
*
*
f
are
linearly
independent
functions
and
the
exponential_function
has
no
zeros
,
these
r
functions
*
*
f
,
form
a
basis
for
the
space
of
solutions
.
