Oersted
's
boyhood
represented
a
minimal
chance
of
either
attaining
greatness
or
serving
his
people
so
well
and
over
so
long
a
span
of
life
.
He
was
born
in
the
small
Danish
town
of
Rudkoebing
on
the
island
of
Langeland
in
the
south_central
part
of
Denmark
on
August
14
,
1777
.
His
father
Soeren
was
the
village
apothecary
whose
slender
income
made
it
difficult
to
feed
his
family
,
let_alone
educate
them
in
a
town
without
even
a
school
.
The
two
older
boys
,
Hans
and
Anders
,
his
junior
by
a
year
,
therefore
went
daily
to
the
home
of
a
warm
and
friendly
wigmaker
nearby
for
instruction
in
German
;
his
wife
taught
the
two
boys
to
read
and
write
Danish
.
Other
brothers
later
joined
them
for
instruction
with
Oldenburg
,
the
wigmaker
,
and
also
arithmetic
was
added
to
Bible
reading
,
German
,
and
Danish
in
the
informal
curriculum
.
Oldenburg
's
contributions
were
soon
exhausted
and
the
boys
had
to
turn_to
a
wider
circle
of
the
town
's
learned
,
such_as
the
pastor
,
to
supplement
the
simple
teaching
.
From
the
town
surveyor
,
Hans
learned
drawing
and
mathematics
and
,
from
a
university_student
,
some
academic
subjects
.
The
mayor
of
the
town
taught
them
English
and
French
.
Whatever
Hans
or
Anders
learned
separately
they
passed_on
to
each
other
;
they
read
every
book
that
they
could
borrow
in
the
village
.
At
12
,
Hans
was
sufficiently
mature
to
help
his
father
in
the
apothecary
shop
,
which
helped
stimulate
his
interest
in
medicine
and
science
.
His
earlier
love
for
literature
and
history
remained
with
him
for
his
entire
life
.
In
1793
the
brothers
decided
to
enter
the
University_of_Copenhagen
(
founded
in
1479
)
and
the
following
spring
found
them
at
the
university
preparing
to
matriculate
for
the
autumn
session
.
While
Hans
devoted
himself
to
the
sciences
of
medicine
,
physics
,
and
astronomy
,
his
brother
studied
law
.
The
brothers
continued
to
help
each
other
during
their
studies
,
sharing
a
joint
purse
,
lodging
together
in
the
dormitory
and
dining
together
at
the
home
of
their
aunt
.
They
supplemented
their
income
by
small
government
assistance
,
by
tutoring
and
economizing
wherever
they
could
.
So
impressive
were
those
serious
years
of
study
at
the
university
that
Hans
later
wrote
,
``
to
be
perfectly
free
,
the
young
man
must
revel
in
the
great
kingdom
of
thought
and
imagination
;
there
is
a
struggle
there
,
in
which
,
if
he
falls
,
it
is
easy
for
him
to
rise
again
,
there
is
freedom
of
utterance
there
,
which
draws
after
it
no
irreparable
consequences
on
society
.
I
lived
in
this
onward
driving
contest
where
each
day
overcame
a
new
difficulty
,
gained
a
new
truth
,
or
banished
a
previous
error
''
.
He
openly
proclaimed
his
pleasure
in
lecturing
and
writing_about
science
.
In_this
third
year
at
the
university
,
Hans
,
in
1797
,
was
awarded
the
first
important
token
of
recognition
,
a
gold
medal
for
his
essay
on
``
Limits_of_Poetry_and_Prose
''
.
He
completed
his
training
in
pharmacy
also
,
taking
his
degree
with
high
honors
in
1797
,
and
in
1799
was
awarded
the
degree
of
Doctor_of_Philosophy
along
with
a
prize
for
an
essay
in
medicine
.
He
proposed
a
fresh
theory
of
alkalis
which
later
was
accepted
in
chemical
practices
.
Han
's
student
days
were
at_a
time
when
Europe
was
in
a
new
intellectual
ferment
following
the
revolutions
in
America
and
in
France
,
Germany
and
Italy
were
rising
from
divisive
nationalisms
and
a
strong
wave
of
intellectual
awareness
was
sweeping
the
Continent
.
The
new
century
opened
with
Oersted
beginning
his
professional
career
in_charge
of
an
apothecary
shop
in
Copenhagen
and
as
lecturer
at
the
university
.
He
was
stirred
by
the
announcement
of
Volta
's
discovery
of
chemical
electricity
and
he
immediately
applied
the
voltaic_pile
to
experiments
with
acids
and
alkalis
.
The
following
year
he
devoted
to
the
customary
``
Wanderjahr
''
,
traveling
in
Germany
,
France
,
and
the_Netherlands
,
meeting
the
philosophers
Schelling
,
Fichte
,
and
Tieck
.
He
also
met
Count_Rumford
(
born
Benjamin_Thompson
in
Woburn,_Mass
.
)
who
was
then
serving
the
Elector_of_Bavaria
,
and
the
physicist
Ritter
;
these
were
Oersted
's
main
contacts
in
science
.
From
Go
^
ttingen
(
1801
)
where
he
stayed
for
10
days
,
he
wrote
,
``
The
first
question
asked
everywhere
is
about
galvanism
.
As
everybody
is
curious
to
see
the
battery
of
glass
tubes
I
have
invented
,
I
have
had
quite
a
small
one
made
here
of
four
glass
tubes
(
in
Copenhagen
I
used
30
)
and
intend
to
carry
it
with
me
''
.
Oersted
joined
Ritter
at
Jena
and
stayed
with
him
for
3
weeks
,
continuing
their
correspondence
after
he
left
.
With
Ritter
he
was
exposed
to
the
fantastic
profusion
of
ideas
that
stormed
through
his
host
's
fertile
but
disorganized
mind
.
Oersted
remodeled
Ritter
's
notes
into
an
essay
in
French
which
was
submitted
to
the
Institut_de_France
for
its
annual
prize
of
3000
francs
.
The
sound
discoveries
of_this
quixotic
genius
were
so
diluted
by
those
of
fantasy
that
the
prize
was
never
awarded
to
him
.
In
May
,
1803
,
Ritter
,
in
another
flight
of
fancy
,
wrote
to
Oersted
a
letter
that
contained
a
remarkable
prophecy
.
He
related
events
on
earth
to
periodic
celestial
phenomena
and
indicated
that
the
years
of
maximum
inclination
of
the
ecliptic
coincided
with
the
years
of
important
electrical
discoveries
.
Thus
,
1745
corresponded
to
the
invention
of
the
``
Leiden
''
jar
by
Kleist
,
1764
that
of
the
electrophorus
by
Wilcke
,
1782
produced
the
condenser
of
Volta
,
and
1801
the
voltaic_pile
.
Ritter
proceeded
,
``
You
now
emerge
into
a
new
epoch
in
which
late
in
the
year
1819
or
1820
,
you
will
have
to
reckon
.
This
we
might
well
witness
''
.
Ritter
died
in
1810
and
Oersted
not_only
lived
to
see
the
event
occur
but
was
the
author
of
it
.
In
1803
Oersted
returned
to
Copenhagen
and
applied
for
the
university
's
chair
in
physics
but
was
rejected
because
he
was
probably
considered
more
a
philosopher
than
a
physicist
.
However
,
he
continued
experimenting
and
lecturing
,
publishing
the
results
of
his
experiments
in
German
and
Danish
periodicals
.
In
1806
his
ambition
was
realized
and
he
became
professor
of
physics
at
the
Copenhagen_University
,
though
not
realizing
full
professorship
(
ordinarius
)
until
1817
.
During
Oersted
's
attendance
at
the
university
,
it
was
poorly
equipped
with
physical
apparatus
for
experimenting
in
the
sciences
.
He
was
,
however
,
fortunate
in
his
contact
with
Prof._J._G._L._Manthey
(
1769
-
1842
)
,
teacher
of
chemistry
,
who
,
in_addition
to
his
academic
chair
,
was
also
proprietor
of
the
``
Lion_Pharmacy
''
in
Copenhagen
where
Oersted
assisted
him
.
Manthey
maintained
a
valuable
collection
of
physical
and
chemical
apparatus
which
was
at
Oersted
's
disposal
during
and
after
his
graduation
.
In
1800
,
Manthey
went
abroad
and
Oersted
was
appointed
manager
of
the
Lion_Pharmacy
.
In
February
1801
,
Oersted
did
manage
to
experiment
with
physical
apparatus
and
reported
experiments
made
with
a
voltaic_battery
of
600
plates
of
zinc
and
silver
and
of
later
experiments
with
a
battery
of
60
plates
of
zinc
and
lead
.
In
the
following
year
,
1803
,
Oersted
,
simultaneously
with
Davy
,
discovered
that
acids
increased
the
strength
of
a
voltaic_battery
more_than
did
salts
.
Eager
as
he
was
to
pursue
this
promising
line
,
he
was
so
loaded_down
with
the
management
of
the
pharmacy
and
lectures
in
the
medical
and
pharmaceutical
faculties
at
the
university
that
he
could
devote
only
Sunday
afternoons
to
``
galvanizing
''
.
He
assumed
his
academic
career
with
the
same
intensity
and
thoroughness
that
had
marked
every
step
in
his
rise
from
boyhood
.
The
university
was
the
only
one
in
Denmark
and
the
status
of
professor
represented
the
upper
social
level
.
His
broad
interest
in
literary
,
political
,
and
philosophical
movements
opened
many
doors
to
him
.
His
friends
were
numerous
and
their
ties
to
him
were
strong
.
The
years
1812
and
1813
saw
him
in
Germany
and
France
again
,
but
on
this
visit
to
Berlin
he
did
not
seek_out
the
philosophers
as
he
had
on
his
first
journey
.
In
Berlin
he
published
his
views
of
the
chemical
laws_of_nature
in
German
and
this
was
issued
in
French
translation
(
Paris
,
1813
)
under
the
title
Recherches_sur_l_'_identite_des_forces_chimiques_et_electriques
,
a
work
held
in
very
high
esteem
by
the
new
generation
of
research
chemists
.
His
interest
in
finding
a
relationship
between
voltaic
electricity
and
magnetism
is
here
first
indicated
.
Chapter
8
,
is
entitled
``
On_Magnetism
''
and
in
it
are
included
such
remarks
as
,
``
One
has
always
been
tempted
to
compare
the
magnetic_forces
with
the
electrical
forces
.
The
great
resemblance
between
electrical
and
magnetic_attractions
and
repulsions
and
the
similarity
of
their
laws
necessarily
would
bring_about
this
comparison
.
It
is
true
,
that
nothing
has
been
found
comparable_with
electricity
by
communication
;
but
the
phenomena
observed
had
such
a
degree
of
analogy
to
those
depending_on
electrical
distribution
that
one
could
not
find
the
slightest
difference
.
The
form
of
galvanic
activity
is
halfway
between
the
magnetic
form
and
the
electrical
form
.
There
,
forces
are
more
latent
than
in
electricity
,
and
less
than
in
magnetism
.
But
in
such
an
important
question
,
we
would
be
satisfied
if
the
judgment
were
that
the
principal
objection
to
the
identity
of
forces
which
produce
electricity
and
magnetism
were
only
a
difficulty
,
and
not
a
thing
which
is
contrary
to_it
.
One
could
also
add
to
these
analogies
that
steel
loses
its
magnetism
by
heat
,
which
proves
that
steel
becomes
a
better
conductor
through
a
rise
in
temperature
,
just
as
electrical
bodies
do
.
It
is
also
found
that
magnetism
exists
in
all
bodies
of
nature
,
as
proven
by
Bruckmann
and
Coulomb
.
By
that
,
one
feels
that
magnetic_forces
are
as
general
as
electrical
forces
.
An
attempt
should
be
made
to
see
if
electricity
,
in
its
most
latent
stage
,
has
any
action
on
the
magnet
as_such
''
.
His
plan
and
intent
were
clearly
charted
.
Oersted
returned
in
1814
and
resumed
an
active
part
in
university
and
political
discussions
.
In
one
debate
he
supported
the
freedom
of
judgment
as_opposed_to
dogma
,
in
another
he
held
that
the
practice
of
science
was
in_fact
an
act
of
religious
worship
.
He
continued
as
a
popular
lecturer
.
He
devised
a
detonating_fuse
in
which
a
short
wire
was
caused
to
glow
by
an
electric_current
.
In
1819
under
royal
command
he
undertook
a
very
successful
geological
expedition
to
Bornholm
,
one
of
the
Danish
islands
,
being
one
of
three
scientists
in
the
expedition
.
It
was
with
the
assistance
of
one
of
the
members
of_this
expedition
,
Lauritz_Esmarch
,
that
Oersted
succeeded
in
producing
light
by
creating
an
electric_discharge
in
mercury
vapor
through
which
an
electric_current
was
made
to
flow
.
Together
they
also
developed
a
new
form
of
voltaic_cell
in
which
the
wooden
trough
was
replaced
by
one
of
copper
,
thereby
producing
stronger
currents
.
Esmarch
was
among
those
who
witnessed
Oersted
's
first
demonstration
of
his
discovery
.
The
association
between
electric
(
both
electrostatic
and
voltaic
)
forces
and
magnetic_forces
had
been
recognized
by
investigators
for
many
decades
.
Electrical
literature
contained
numerous
references
to
lightning
that
had
magnetized
iron
and
had
altered
the
polarity
of
compass
needles
.
In
the
late
1700
's
Beccaria
and
van_Marum
,
among
others
,
had
magnetized
iron
by
sending
an
electrostatic
charge
through
it
.
Beccaria
had
almost
stumbled
on
a
lead
to
the
relationship
between
electricity
and
magnetism
when
a
discharge
from
a
Leyden_jar
was
sent
transversally
through
a
piece
of
watch
spring
steel
making
its
ends
magnetic
.
The
resulting
magnetic
effect
proved
stronger
than
when
the
discharge
was
made
lengthwise
.
The
experiments
of
Romagnosi
and_others
have
already
been
noted
but
no
one
had
determined
the
cause
and
effect
relationship
between
these
two
primary
forces
.
Oersted
's
own
earlier
experiments
were
unimpressive
,
possibly
because
he
had
,
like
other
experimenters
,
laid
the
conducting_wire
across
the
compass
needle
instead_of
parallel
with_it
.
The
sequence
of
events
leading
to
his
important
discovery
still
remains
ambiguous
but
it
seems
that
one
of
the
advanced
students
at
the
university
related
that
the
first
direct
event
that
led
to
the
publication
of
Oersted
's
discovery
occurred
during
a
private
lecture
made
before
a
group
of
other
advanced
students
in
the
spring
of
1820
.
At
this
lecture
Oersted
happened
to
place
the
conducting_wire
over
and
parallel
to
a
magnetic_needle
.
