Andy
did
not
see
the
newspapers
the
next
day
.
Someone
on
his
staff
-
he
suspected
it
was
Ed_Thornburg
-
intercepted
them
and
for
this
Andy
was
grateful
.
He
finally
fell_asleep
around
six
in
the
morning
with
the
aid
of
a
sleeping_capsule
,
a
crutch
he
rarely
used
,
and
did
n't
awaken
until
early
afternoon
.
Memory
flooded
him
the
instant
he
opened
his
eyes
and
the
sick
feeling
knotted
his
stomach
.
Outside
his
window
bloomed
a
beautiful
summer
day
.
Presumably
the
same
sun
was
shining
upon
little
Drew
also
,
and
those
who
had
kidnapped
him
.
But
where
?
It
was
still
a
very
big
world
,
despite
all
the
modern
cant
to_the_contrary
.
Hub
was
sitting
in
a
chair
that
blocked
the
hall
door
.
He
was
dozing
,
perhaps
the
only
sleep
he
'd
gotten
.
He
snapped
to
alertness
at
Andy
's
entrance
.
``
Sorry
,
Mr._Paxton
.
Nothing
new
.
Lot
of
people
waiting
to
see
you
,
though
''
.
``
Reporters
''
?
``
Our
own
people
.
Questions
about
the
show
tonight
''
.
Hub
picked_up
the
telephone
.
``
Shall
I
let
them
know
you
're
awake
''
?
``
I
suppose
.
How
's
Lissa
,
do
you
know
''
?
Hub
considered
.
``
Some
better
.
She
's
got
plenty
of
guts
,
Mr._Paxton
.
You
want
me
to
call
her
''
?
``
She
expecting
me
to
''
?
Hub
shook
his
head
so
Andy
told
him
not
to
bother
.
The
only
reason
for
contacting
Lissa
was
to
comfort
or
to
be
comforted
.
He
could
not
manage
the
former
or
expect
the
latter
;
they
had
nothing
to
give
to
each
other
.
The
omission
might
look
peculiar
to
outsiders
,
but
Andy
could
not
bring
himself
to
go_through_the_motions
simply
for
the
sake
of
appearances
.
He
had
little
time
to
himself
,
anyway
.
As
the
afternoon
sped
toward
evening
,
the
suite
saw
a
steady
procession
of
Paxton
aides
pass
in
and
out
,
each
with
his
own
special
problem
.
Thornburg
arrived
with
the
writers
.
They
had
spent
the
morning
revising
the
act
,
eliminating
all
the
gay
songs
,
patter
and
dancing
with
a
view
of
the
best
public_relations
.
What
remained
lacked
the
original
verve
but
it
was
at_least
dignified
,
as
befitting
the
tragic
circumstances
.
Raymond_Fox
reported
that
the
orchestra
had
hastily
rehearsed
``
Cradle_Song
''
in_case
it
was
needed
.
Charlie_Marble
was
back_and_forth
on
several
occasions
,
first
to
confer_with
Andy
on
the
advisability
of
cancelling
the
Las_Vegas
engagement
-
they
decided
it
was
wise
-
and
later
to
announce
that
a
prominent
comedian
,
also
an
agency
client
,
had
agreed
to
fill
the
casino
's
open
date
.
And
once
Bake
slipped
in
,
pale
and
drawn
,
last
night
's
liquor
still
on
his
breath
with
some
of
today
's
added
to_it
.
He
asked
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
.
Andy
invented
a
job
to
keep
him
busy
,
sending
him
ahead
to
El_Dorado
to
supervise
last_minute
arrangements
.
But
from
Rocco_Vecchio
,
they
heard
nothing
.
At_last
it
was
time
to
depart
.
Hub
,
nosing
about
,
spotted
reporters
in
the
lobby
,
so
Andy
was
hustled
away
quietly
through
the
hotel
's
service_entrance
in
a
strange
car
which
Hub
had
procured
somewhere
.
They
succeeded
in
eluding
the
curious
at
the
hotel
,
but
there
was
no
chance
of
avoiding
them
at
the
nightclub
.
El_Dorado
was
surrounded
by
a
mob
.
They
overflowed
the
parking_lot
,
making
progress
by
automobile
difficult
.
Long
before
he
reached
the
protection
of
the
stage_door
,
Andy
was
recognized
.
Word
of
his
arrival
spread
through
the
crowd
like
a
brush-fire
.
They
surged
around
him
,
fingers
pointing
,
eyes
prying
.
It
was
not
a
hostile
gathering
but
Andy
sensed
the
difference
from
last
night
's
hero-worshippers
.
They
had
come
not
to
admire
but
to
observe
.
``
It
's
worse
inside
''
,
Thornburg
informed
Andy
.
``
Skolman
's
jammed
in
every
table
he
could
find
.
Under
the
heading
of_it
's
an
ill
wind
,
et_cetera
''
.
Backstage
was
tomb
like
by
contrast
.
Andy
's
co-workers
kept
their
distance
,
awed
by
the
tragedy
.
But
in
his
dressing_room
was
a
large
bouquet
and
a
card
that
read
,
``
We
're
with
you
all_the_way
''
.
It
was
signed
by
everyone
in
the
troupe
.
Andy
could
n't
help
but
be
touched
.
He
instructed
Shirl_Winter
to
compose
a
note
of
thanks
to
be
posted
on
the
call_board
.
Bake
was
waiting
to
report
that
Lou_DuVol
had
been
sobered_up
to
the
point
where
he
could
function
efficiently
.
Andy
gathered
that
this
had
been
no
small
accomplishment
.
Bake
himself
looked
better
;
any
kind
of
job
was
better
than
brooding
.
Andy
told
him
,
``
Bake
,
I
wish
you
'd
talk
to
Skolman
,
see
if
some
kind
of
p._a._system
can
be
rigged_up
outside
.
It
's
just
barely
possible
with
this
crowd
that
the
kidnapper
was
n't
able
to
get
a
table
.
I
would
n't
want
him
to
miss
the
message
''
.
``
I
'll
try
.
Skolman
is
n't
going_to
like
it
much
,
though
,
giving_away
what
he
should
be
selling
''
.
Skolman
was
n't
the
only
one
who
did
n't
care_for
Andy
's
scheme
.
A
short
time
later
,
Lieutenant_Bonner
stomped
into
the
dressing_room
.
``
I
got_a_bone_to_pick
with
you
,
Mr._Paxton
.
It
's
those
damn
loudspeakers
''
.
Andy
rolled_up
the
revised
script
he
had
been
studying
.
``
What
about
them
''
?
``
They
're
going_to
louse
me
up
good
.
My
men
have
been
here
all
afternoon
,
setting_up
for
this
thing
''
.
Bonner
explained
that
,
with
the
nightclub
's
cooperation
,
the
police
had
occupied
El_Dorado
like
a
battlefield
.
Motion_picture
cameras
had
been
installed
to
film
the
audience
,
the
reservation
list
was
being
checked_out
name
by
name
,
and
a
special
detail
was
already
at_work
in
the
parking_lot
scrutinizing
automobiles
for
a
possible
lead
.
However
,
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
screen
the
mob
outside
,
even
if
Bonner
had
manpower
available
for
the
purpose
.
``
I
want
you
to
have
the
speakers
taken_out
''
.
Andy
sighed
.
``
Seems
like
we
're
never
going
to
see_eye_to_eye
,
Lieutenant
.
Did
n't
they
tell
you
what
I
wanted
the
p._a._system
for
''
?
``
Sure
,
I
know
.
But
it
's
such
a
long_shot
''
-
``
No
longer
than
yours
.
What
do
you
expect
to
get
tonight
,
anyway
?
You
think
somebody
is
going_to
stand_up
in
the
audience
and
make
guilty
faces
?
Or
have
a
sign
on
his
car
that
says
,
'
Here
Comes
the
Paxton
Kidnapper
''
'
?
Andy
crumbled
the
script
in
his
fist
.
``
I
can
n't
stop
you
from
doing
what
you
think
is
right
.
But
do
n't
try
to
stop
me
,
either
''
.
``
Someday
''
,
Bonner
said
,
``
you
're
going_to
ask
us
for
help
.
I
can
hardly
wait
''
.
``
What
you
do
n't
understand
is
that
I'm
asking
for
it
now
''
.
But
Bonner
departed
,
still
full
of
ill_will
.
He
had
gotten
stuck_with
a
job
too
big
for
his
imagination
;
he
had
to
cling_to
routine
,
tested
procedures
.
To
act
otherwise
would
be
to
admit
his
helplessness
.
But
,
admit
or
not
,
Bonner
was
helpless
.
The
crime
showed
too
much
planning
,
the
kidnappers
appeared
too
proficient
to
be
caught
by
a
checklist
.
Andy
's
performance
was
scheduled
for
eleven
o'clock
.
He
stalled
for
a
half-hour
longer
,
hoping
to
hear
something
from
Vecchio
about
the
ransom_money
.
Bake
and
Shirl_Winter
,
on
separate
telephones
,
could
not
reach
him
at
any
conceivable
location
in
Los_Angeles
,
nor
could
they
secure
any
clear-cut
information
regarding
his
efforts
.
Bake
cursed
.
``
The
sweaty
bastard
's
probably
halfway
to
Peru
with
our
money
by
now
''
.
When
no
one
smiled
,
he
felt
constrained
to
add
,
``
Just
kidding
,
natch
''
.
Thornburg
popped_in
to
advise
,
``
Andy
,
Skolman
's
sending_up_smoke_signals
.
You
about
ready
''
?
``
What
's
he
complaining
about
''
?
Bake
asked
.
``
They
're
drinking
,
are
n't
they
''
?
``
No
.
We
got
a
bunch
of
sippers
out
there
tonight
.
I
guess
nobody
wants
to
pass_out
and
miss
anything
''
.
Thornburg
added
in
a
lower
voice
but
Andy
overheard
,
``
They
act
more
like
a
jury
than
an
audience
''
.
Andy
said
,
``
Well
,
I
guess
we
can
n't
wait
any
longer
.
Hub
,
you
stick
by
the
stage_door
.
If
Rock
shows_up
during
the
number
-
or
you
hear
anything
-
give
me
the
signal
''
.
Shirl_Winter
said
,
``
I
'll
stay
on
the
phone
,
Mr._Paxton
.
There
's
a_couple_of
call-backs
I
can
work_on
''
.
``
You
're
a
sweetheart
-
but
leave
one
line
open
.
He
may
try
to
phone
us
''
.
Andy
passed
into
the
corridor
,
their
``
good_lucks
''
!
following
him
.
It
was
what
they
said
before
every
performance
but
tonight
it
sounded
different
,
as
if
he
really
needed
it
.
They
were
right
.
The
act
,
cut
to
shreds
and
hastily
patched
together
during
the
afternoon
,
had
not
been
rehearsed
sufficiently
by
anyone
.
The
result
had
nothing
of
the
polish
,
pace
or
cohesion
of
the
previous
night
.
Here
's
where
luck
would
normally
step_in
.
But
this
was
no
ordinary
show
and
Andy
knew
it
.
Whether
he
sang
well
or
badly
had
nothing
to
do
with_it
.
The
audience
had
come
not
to
be
entertained
but
to
judge
.
Twenty-four_hours
had
changed
him
from
a
performer
to
a
freak
.
Within
this
framework
,
what
followed
was
strained
,
even
macabre
.
Eliminating
the
patter
and
the
upbeat
numbers
left
little
but
blues
and
other
songs
of
equal
melancholy
.
The
effect
was
as
depressing
as
a
gravestone
,
the
applause
irresolute
and
short-lived
.
Yet
Andy
plowed_ahead
,
mouthing
the
inconsequential
words
as
if
they
possessed
real
meaning
,
and
gradually
his
listeners
warmed_to
him
.
Their
clapping
grew
more
fervent
;
the
evening
was
still
not
beyond
salvaging
,
not
as
a
show
but
for
him
as
a
person
.
The
worst
was
yet
to
come
.
As
Andy
reached
the
finale
of
his
act
,
a
subdued
commotion
backstage
drew
his
attention
to
the
wings
.
Rocco_Vecchio
-
a
perspiring
,
haggard
Vecchio
-
was
standing
there
,
flanked
by
two
men
in
the
uniforms
of
armored
transport
guards
.
Vecchio
was
nodding
and
pointing
at
the
large
suitcase
he
held
.
Andy
felt
his
heart
thud
heavily
with
relief
.
He
waved
at
Fox
to
cut_off
the
finale
introduction
.
The
music
died_away
discordantly
.
He
drew
a
deep
breath
.
``
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
in_place_of
my
regular
closing
number
tonight
,
I
'd
like
to
sing
something
of
a
different
nature
for
you
.
Ray
,
if
you
please
-
the
'
Cradle_Song
''
'
.
He
sensed
rather_than
heard
the
gasp
that
swept
across
the
audience
.
Nor
could
he
blame
them
.
This
particular
song
at
this
particular
time
could
only
be
interpreted
as
the
ultimate
in
bad
taste
,
callous
exploitation
beyond
the
bounds
of
decency
.
Having
no
choice
,
he
plunged
into
it
,
anyway
,
holding
onto
the
microphone
for
support
.
``
Lullaby_and_goodnight
''
.
voice
shook
.
For_the_first_time
in
his
life
he
forgot
the
lyrics
midway
through
and
had
to
cover_up
by
humming
the
rest
.
He
wondered
if
the
audience
would
let
him
finish
.
They
did
;
though
contemptuous
,
they
were
still
polite
.
But
when
he
was
finally
through
,
their
scorn
was
made
apparent
.
Someone
clapped
tentatively
then
quickly
stopped
.
Otherwise
,
the
silence
was
complete
.
As
the
lights
came_up
,
Andy
could
see
that
a
number
of
patrons
were
already
on
their
way
toward
the
exit
.
He
stumbled
off-stage
.
``
My_God
''
,
he
muttered
.
``
My_God
''
.
Hub
was
there
to
support
him
.
``
It
's
okay
,
Mr._Paxton
.
The
money
's
here
,
all_of
it
''
.
At
this
moment
,
all
he
could
think_of
was
what
he
'd
been
forced
to
undergo
.
``
Did
you
hear
them
?
Do
you
know
what
they
think_of
me
''
?
``
Bunch
of
damn
jerks
''
,
Hub
growled
.
``
Who
needs
them
''
?
Thornburg
patted
his
arm
.
``
Sure
,
Andy
,
it
'll
be
all_right
.
Nothing
broken
that
can
n't
be
mended
''
.
The
words
were
hollow
.
Thornburg
knew
,
better
than
any
of
them
,
that
a
public
image
was
as
fragile
as
Humpty_Dumpty
.
All
the
king
's
horses
and
all
the
king
's
men
.
Vecchio
shouldered_in
.
``
I
got_it
,
Andy
.
God_knows_how
,
but
I
got_it
.
You
'll
never
believe
the
places
I
've
been
today
.
I
practically
had
to
sign
your
life
away
,
you
'll
probably
fire
me
for
some
of
the
deals
I
had
to
go_for
,
but
''
-
Andy
nodded
dully
.
``
It
does
n't
matter
,
Rock
.
We
've
done
our
part
''
.
He
clutched
that
knowledge
to
him
as
he
returned
to
his
dressing_room
.
The
usual
congratulatory
crowd
was
conspicuously
absent
;
the
place
had
the
air
of
a
morgue
.
Andy
had
no
desire
to
linger
himself
but
Hub
reported
that
the
mob
outside
was
still
large
despite
the
efforts
of
the
police
to
disperse
them
.
