Pope_Leo
13
,
,
on
the
13
th
day
of
December
1898
,
granted
the
following
indulgences
:
``
An
indulgence
of
three
hundred
days
is
granted
to
all
the
Faithful
who
read
the
Holy_Gospels
at_least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
A
Plenary_Indulgence
under
the
usual
conditions
is
granted
once
a
month
for
the
daily
reading
''
.
Pope_Pius
the
Sixth
,
at
Rome
,
in
april
,
1778
,
wrote
the
following
:
``
The
faithful
should
be
excited
to
the
reading
of
the
Holy_Scriptures
:
For
these
are
the_most
abundant
sources
which
ought_to
be_left
open_to
everyone
,
to
draw
from
them
purity
of
morals
and
of
doctrine
,
to
eradicate
errors
which
are
so
widely
disseminated
in
these
corrupt
times
''
.
The
American_Bishops
assembled
at
the
Third_Plenary_Council
of
Baltimore
urged
the
Catholic
people
to
read
the
Holy_Bible
.
``
We
hope
''
,
they
said
,
``
that
no
family
can
be
found
amongst
us
without
a
correct
version
of
the
Holy_Scriptures
''
.
They
recommended
,
also
,
that
``
at
a
fixed
hour
,
let
the
entire
family
be
assembled
for
night
prayers
,
followed
by
a
short
reading
of
the
Holy_Scriptures
''
.
Since
the
Catholic_Church
expresses
such
desire
that
the
Sacred
Scriptures
be
read
,
the
following
taken
from
the
Holy_Bible
(
New_Catholic_Edition
)
will
prove
a
means
of
grace
and
a
source
of
great
spiritual
blessing
.
Do
not
wonder
that
I
said
to
thee
,
``
You
must
be_born
again
''

those

In

,
the
god
of_this

Being
convinced
that
salvation
is
alone
by
accepting
Christ
as
Saviour
,
and
being
convicted
by
the
Holy_Spirit
of
my
lost
condition

I
do
repent
of
all
effort
to
be
saved
by
any
form
of
good
works
,
and
just_now
receive
Jesus
as
my
personal
Saviour
and
salvation
as
a
free
gift
from
Him

You
may
do
as
you
please
with
God
now

It
is
permitted

God
placed
Himself
in
men
's
hands
when
He
sent
Jesus_Christ
into
the
world
as
perfect
God
and
perfect
Man
in
one
Being
.
He
was
then
in
man
's
hands

They
cursed
Him
.
It
was
permitted
.
Men
spit
on
Him
.
God
allowed
it
.
They
called
Him
a
devil
.
God
withheld
His
wrath
.
Finally
men
arrested
Him
,
gave
Him
a
mock
trial
,
flogged
Him
,
nailed
Him
on
a
cross
and
hung
Him
between
earth
and
heaven
;
and
God
allowed
it
.
You
can
do
likewise
though
Christ
is
not
bodily
present
.
You
can
ignore
Him
.
You
can
ignore
His
Book
,
the
Bible
,
and
His
church
.
You
can
laugh_at
His
blood-bought
salvation
,
curse
His
followers
,

laugh_at
hell

It
is
permitted

The
eternal
Christ
may
knock
at
your
soul

You
may
refuse
Him

you
so
choose

now

On_the_other_hand

you
may
seek
His
favor
,
humble
yourself
before
Him
and
beg
His
mercy
,
implore
His
forgiveness
,
forsake
your
sins
,
and
abandon
your
whole
life
to
Him
.
He
has
said
,
``
Behold
,
I
stand

if
any
man
hear
my
voice

I

will
sup
with

choice
is

latch
is

side

door

The
choice
is
yours

the
revellings
and
banquetings
of_this

quiet
communion
with
God
;
the
ever
burning
lusts
of
the
flesh

the
powerful
victory

discipline

The
choice
is
yours

God
is
in

now

God
has
already
set
the
day
when
you
will
be
in
His
hands

What
He
does
with

what
you
do

Then
it
will
be
a

fall_into

have
abused
