Knowing
specifically
what
the
many
feed
additives
can
do
and_how
and
when
to
feed
them
can
make
a
highly
competitive
business
more
profitable
for
beef
,
dairy
,
and

.
The
target

quickly
and
briefly
tells

All
the
additives

adequately
balanced
with
protein
,
vitamins
,
and

The
drug
's
chemical
name
is
listed
,
since
most
states
require
feed

to
use
this

In
some
instances
,
the
trade_name
is
shown
in

This
indicates
that
this

There
are
three
principal
feed_bunk
types
for
dairy
and
beef_cattle
:
(
1
)
Fence-line
bunks
-
cattle
eat
from
one
side
while
feed
is
put_in
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
fence
by
self
unloading
wagons
;
(
2
)
Mechanized
bunks
-
they
sit
within
the
feed_lot
,
are
filled
by
a
mechanical
conveyor
above
feeding
surface
;
(
3
)
Special
bunks
-
as
discussed
here
,
they
permit
cattle
to
eat
from
all
sides
.
Feed
is
put_in
with
an
elevator
.
Several
materials
or
combinations
of
materials
can
be
used
to
construct
a
satisfactory
feed_bunk
.
The
selection
of
materials
depends_on
skills
of
available
labor
for
installation
,
cost
of
materials
available
locally
,
and
your
own
preference
.
No
one
material
is
best
for
all
situations
.
Selecting
bunks
by
economic
comparison
is
usually
an
individual
problem
.
Animals
eat
only
from
one
side
,
so
the
fence-line
bunk
must
be
twice
as
long
as
the
mechanical
bunk
.
These
bunks
also
serve
as
a
fence
,
so
part
of
the
additional
cost
must
be
attributed
to
the
fence
.
Because
of
their
location
,
on
the
edge
of
the
feed_lot
,
fence-line
bunks
are
not
in_the_way_of
mechanical
manure
removal
.
Filling
these
bunks
by
the
same
self
unloading
wagons
used
to
fill
silos
spreads
cost
of
the
wagons
over
more
time
and
operations
.
All-weather
roads
must
be
provided
next
to
the
feeding
floor
so
access
will
be
possible
all
year
.
This
will
be
a
problem
in
areas
of
heavy
snowfall
.
