If
the
Cardinals
heed
Manager_Gene_Mauch
of
the
Phillies
,
they
won't
be
misled
by
the
Pirates
'
slower
start
this
season
.
``
Pittsburgh
definitely
is
the
team
to
beat
''
,
Mauch
said
here
the
other
day
.
``
The
Pirates
showed
they
could
outclass
the
field
last
year
.
They
have
the
same
men
,
no
age
problem
,
no
injuries
and
they
also
have
Vinegar_Bend_Mizell
for
the
full
season
,
along
with
Bobby_Shantz
''
.
Tonight
at
8
o'clock
the
Cardinals
,
who
gave
the
Pirates
as
much
trouble
as
anyone
did
in
1960
,
breaking_even
with
them
,
will
get
their
first
1961
shot
at
baseball
's
world
champions
.
The
Pirates
have
a
9
-
6
record
this
year
and
the
Redbirds
are
7
-
9
.
Solly_Hemus
announced
a
switch
in
his
starting_pitcher
,
from
Bob_Gibson
to
Ernie_Broglio
,
for
several
reasons
:
1
.
Broglio
's
4
-
0
won-lost_record
and
1.24
earned-run
mark
against
Pittsburgh
a
year
ago
;

.
The
desire
to
give
Broglio
as
many
starts
as
possible
;
3
.
The
Redbirds
'
disheartening
11
-
7
collapse
against
the
Phillies
Sunday
.
Manager_Hemus
,
eager
to
end
a
pitching
slump
that
has
brought
four
losses
in
the
five
games
on
the
current
home
stand
,
moved
Gibson
to
the
Wednesday
night
starting
assignment
.
After
Thursday
's
open
date
,
Solly
plans
to
open
with
Larry_Jackson
against
the
Cubs
here
Friday
night
.
Harvey_Haddix
,
set_back
by
the
flu
this
season
,
will
start
against
his
former
Cardinal
mates
,
who
might
be
playing
without
captain
Kenny_Boyer
in
tonight
's
game
at
Busch_Stadium
.
Boyer
is
suffering
from
a
stiff
neck
.
Haddix
has
a
13
-
8
record
against
the
Redbirds
,
despite
only
a
1
-
3
mark
in
1960
.
Pirate_Manager_Danny_Murtaugh
said
he
had
n't
decided
between
Mizell
and
Vern_Law
for
Wednesday
's
game
.
Mizell
has
won
both
of
his
starts
.
After
a
lengthy
workout
yesterday
,
an
open
date
,
Hemus
said
that
Bob_Nieman
definitely
would
stay
in
the
lineup
.
That
means
Stan_Musial
probably
will
ride_the_bench
on
the
seventh
anniversary
of
his
record
five
home_run
day
against
the
Giants
.
``
I
have
to
stay
with
Nieman
for_a_while
''
,
Hemus
said
.
``
Bill_White
(
sore
ankles
)
should
be
ready
.
With
a
lefthander
going
for
Pittsburgh
,
I
may
use
Don_Taussig
in
center
''
.
``
Lindy_McDaniel
threw
batting
practice
about
25
minutes
,
and
he
looked
good
''
,
Hemus
said
.
``
He
should
be
getting_back
in_the_groove
before_long
.
Our
pitching
is
much
better
than
it
has
shown
''
.
The
statistics
hardly
indicated
that
the
Pirates
needed
extra
batting
practice
,
but
Murtaugh
also
turned
his
men
loose
at
Busch_Stadium
yesterday
.
Until
the
Bucs
'
bats
quieted_down
a_bit
in
Cincinnati
over
the
weekend
,
the
champions
had
eight
men
hitting
over
.300
.
Despite
the
recession
,
Pittsburgh
came
into
town
with
this
imposing
list
of
averages
:
Smoky_Burgess
.455
,
Gino_Cimoli
.389
,
Bill_Virdon
.340
,
Bob_Clemente
and
Dick_Groat
,
each
.323
,
Dick_Stuart
.306
,
Don_Hoak
.280
and
Bob_Skinner
.267
.
Bill_Mazeroski
with
.179
and
Hal_Smith
with
.143
were
the
only
Pirates
dragging_their_feet
.
Perhaps
the
Pirate
who
will
be
the
unhappiest
over
the
news
that
Musial
probably
will
sit_out
most
of
the
series
is
Bob_Friend
,
who
was
beaten
by
The_Man
twice
last
season
on
dramatic
home_runs
.
Friend
is
off
to
a
great
start
with
a
4
-
0
record
but
is
n't
likely
to
see
action
here
this
week
.
``
We
're
getting
Friend
some
runs
for
a
change
,
and
he
has
been
pitching
good
''
,
Murtaugh
said
.
``
Virdon
has
been
blasting
the
ball
.
No
plunkers
for
him
''
.
The
Pirates
jumped_off
to
an
11
-
3
start
by
May
1
last
year
,
when
the
Redbirds
as_well_as
the
Dodgers
held
them
even
over
the
season
.
On
last
May
1
,
the
Cardinals
stood
at
7
-
6
,
ending
a
two
season
fall-off
on
that
milestone
.
In
1958
,
the_Birds
were
3
-
10
on
May
1
.
A
year
later
they
were
4
-
13
.
Since
1949
,
the
St._Louis
club
has
been
below
.500
on
May
1
just
four
times
.
The
'49
team
was
off
to
a
so-so
5
-
5
beginning
,
then
fell
as
low
as
12
-
17
on
May
23
before
finishing
with
96
victories
.
The
'52
Cards
were
6
-
7
on
May
1
but
ended
with
88
triumphs
,
the
club
's
top
since
1949
.
Then
last
season
the_Birds
tumbled
as
low
as
11
-
18
on
May
19
before
recovering
to
make
a
race
of
it
and
total
86
victories
.
Since
1949
,
the
only
National_League
club
that
got_off
to
a
hot
start
and
made
a
runaway
of
the
race
was
the
'55
Dodger
team
.
Those
Dodgers
won
their
first
10
games
and
owned
a
21
-
2
mark
and
a
nine
game
lead
by
May
8
.
The
club
that
overcame
the
worst
start
in
a
comparable
period
to
win
the
pennant
was
New_York
's
'51
Giants
,
who
dropped
11
of
their
first
13
.
They
honored
the
battling
Billikens
last
night
.
Speakers
at
a
Tipoff_Club
dinner
dealt
lavish
praise
to
a
group
of
St._Louis_University
players
who
,
in
the
words
of
Coach_John_Benington
,
``
had
more
confidence
in
themselves
than
I
did
''
.
The
most_valuable_player
award
was
split
three
ways
,
among
Glen_Mankowski
,
Gordon_Hartweger
and
Tom_Kieffer
.
In_addition
,
a
special
award
was
given
to
Bob_(_Bevo_)
Nordmann
,
the
6
-
foot
-
10
center
who
missed
much
of
the
season
because
of
a
knee
injury
.
``
You
often
hear
people
talk_about
team_spirit
and
that
sort
of
thing
''
,
Benington
said
in
a
conversation
after
the
ceremonies
,
``
but
what
this
team
had
was
a_little
different
.
The
boys
had
a
tremendous
respect
for
each
other
's
ability
.
They
knew
what
they
could
do
and
it
was
often
a_little
more
than
I
thought
they
could
do
.
``
Several
times
I
found
the
players
pepping
me
up
,
where
it
usually
is
the
coach
who
is
supposed
to
deliver
the
fight
talk
.
We
'd
be
losing
at
halftime
to
a
good
team
and
Hartweger
would
say
,
'
Do
n't
worry
,
Coach
-
we
'll
get
'em
all_right
''
'
.
The
trio
who
shared
the
most-valuable
honors
were
introduced
by
Bob_Broeg
,
sports_editor
of
the
Post-Dispatch
.
Kieffer
,
the
only
junior
in
the
group
,
was
commended
for
his
ability
to
hit
in
the
clutch
,
as_well
as
his
all-round
excellent
play
.
Mankowski
,
the
ball-hawking
defensive
expert
,
was
cited
for
his
performance
against
Bradley
in
St._Louis_U.
's
nationally
televised
victory
.
Benington
said
,
``
I
've
never
seen
a
player
have
a
game
as
great
as
Mankowski
did
against
Bradley
that
day
''
.
Benington
recalled
that
he
once
told
Hartweger
that
he
doubted
Gordon
would
ever
play
much
for
him
because
he
seemed
to
be
lacking
in
all
of
the
accepted
basketball
skills
.
After
the
coach
listed
all
the
boy
's
faults
,
Hartweger
said
,
``
Coach
before
I
leave
here
,
you
'll
get
to
like
me
''
.
Mrs._Benington
admired
Gordon
's
spirit
and
did
what
she
could
to
persuade
her
husband
that
the
boy
might
help
the
team
.
As
Hartweger
accepted
his
silver
bowl
,
he
said
,
``
I
want
to
thank
coach
's
wife
for
talking
him
into
letting
me
play
''
.
Bob_Burnes
,
sports_editor
of
the
Globe-Democrat
,
presented
Bob_Nordmann
with
his
award
.
Bevo
was
congratulated
for
his
efforts
to
stay
in
shape
so_that
he
could
help
the
team
if
his
knee
healed
in_time
.
Within
a
week
after
the
injury
,
suffered
in
St._Louis
's
victory
in
the
final
game
of
the
Kentucky
tournament
,
Nordmann
was
sitting
on
the
Bill
's
bench
doing
what
he
could
to
help
Benington
.
On
the
clock
given
him
was
the
inscription
,
``
For
Outstanding
Contribution
to
Billiken_Basketball
,
1960
-
61
''
.
Other
lettermen
from
the
team
that
compiled
a
21
-
9
record
and
finished
as
runner-up
in
the
National_Invitation_Tournament
were
:
Art_Hambric
,
Donnell_Reid
,
Bill_Nordmann
,
Dave_Harris
,
Dave_Luechtefeld
and
George_Latinovich
.
``
This
team
set
a
precedent
that
could
be
valuable
in
the
future
''
,
Benington
pointed_out
.
``
By
winning
against
Bradley
,
Kentucky
and
Notre_Dame
on
those
teams
'
home
courts
,
they
showed
that
the
home
court
advantage
can
be
overcome
anywhere
and
that
it
doesn
's
take
a
super
team
to
do_it
''
.
St._Louis_University
found
a
way
to
win
a
baseball_game
.
Larry_Scherer
last
night
pitched
a
no-hit_game
,
said
to
be
the
first
in
Billiken
baseball
history
,
as
the
Blue_and_White
beat
Southeast_Missouri_State_College
,
5
-
1
,
at
Crystal_City
.
The
victory
was
the
first
of
the
season
for
the
Billikens
after
nine
defeats
and
a
tie
.
The
tie
was
against
Southeast_Missouri
last
Friday
.
Scherer
also
had
a
big
night
at
bat
with
four
hits
in
five
trips
including
a
double
,
Len_Boehmer
also
was
4
-
for
-
5
with
two
doubles
and
Dave_Ritchie
had
a
home_run
and
a
triple
.
St._Louis_U.
was
to
be
in
action
again
today
with
a
game
scheduled
at
4
against
Washington_University
at
Ligget_Field
.
The
game
opened
a
busy
week
for
Washington
.
The
Bears
are
set
to
play
at
Harris_Teachers_College
at
3:30
tomorrow
and
have
a
doubleheader
at
Quincy
,
Ill.
,
Saturday
.
If
it
's
true
that
contented
cows
give
more
milk
,
why
should
n't
happy
ball
players
produce
more
base_hits
?
The
two
top
talents
of
the
time
,
Mickey_Mantle
and
Willie_Mays
,
have
hit
the
ball
harder
and
more
successfully
so_far
this
early
season
than
at
any
period
in
careers
which
,
to
be
frank
about
it
,
never
have
quite
reached
expectations
.
And
that
's
meant
as
a
boost
,
not
a
knock
.
Mays
and
Mantle
,
both
10
-
year
men
at
30
,
have
so
much
ability
that
,
baseball
men
agree
,
they
've
never
hit
the
heights
.
Their
heights
,
that_is
.
Mantle
,
the
bull-necked
blond
switch-hitter
,
had
one
sensational
triple-crown_season
,
1959
,
when
he
batted
.365
and
also
led
the
American_League
in
home_runs
,
52
,
and
RBIs
,
130
.
Like
the
Yankees
'
slugger
,
Mays
,
the
terror
of
the
Giants
,
has
had
seasons
that
would
be
considered
the
ultimate
by
most
players
,
but
not
by
-
or
for
-
Willie
.
His
best
years
were
1954
when
he
hit
.345
with
41
homers
and
'55
when
he
belted
51
home_runs
,
drove_in
127
and
stole
24
bases
.
Now
,
apparently
happier
under
new
managers
,
Mays
and
Mantle
,
the
perfect
players
,
are
behaving
as
though
they
're
going_to
pass
those
previous
peaks
.
Yes
,
we
know
,
they
're
professionals
,
men
paid
to
play
,
and
they
should
n't
care
how
they
're
handled
,
just
as_long_as
their
names
are
spelled
correctly
on
the
first
and
fifteenth
of
each_month
.
The
truth
is
,
though
,
that
men
react
differently
to
different
treatment
.
For_that_matter
,
Stan_Musial
is
rare
,
possessing
the
disposition
that
enabled
him
to
put_out
the
same
for
seven
managers
,
reserving
his
opinions
,
but
not
his
effort
.
Mantle
,
it
's
apparent
,
resented
Casey_Stengel
's
attempts
to
push
and
prod
him
into
the
perfection
the
veteran
manager
saw
as
a
thrilling
possibility
.
The
old_man
was
almost
too
possessive
.
Stengel
inherited
DiMaggio
,
Rizzuto
,
but
he
brought_up
Mantle
from
Class
C
to
the
majors
,
from
Joplin
to
New_York
.
With
the
speed
and
power
of
the
body
beautiful
he
saw
before
him
,
Ol_'_Case
wanted
No.
7
to
be
not_only
the
best
homerun
hitter
,
but
also
the
best
bunter
,
base-runner
and
outfielder
.
Stengel
probably
preached
too_much
in
the
early
days
when
the
kid
wanted
to
pop
his
bubble_gum
and
sow_his_oats
.
Inheriting
a
more
mature
Mantle
,
who
now
has
seen
the
sights
on
and
off
Broadway
,
Ralph_Houk
quietly
bestowed
,
no
pun
intended
,
the
mantle
of
authority
on
Mickey
.
The
Major
decided
that
,
rather_than
be
led
,
the
slugger
could
lead
.
And
what
leadership
a
proud
Mantle
has
given
so_far
.
The
opinion
continues
here
that
with
a
162
-
game
schedule
,
pitching
spread
thin
through
a
10
-
team
league
and
a
most
inviting
target
in
Los_Angeles
'
Wrigley_Field_Jr.
,
Mantle
just
might
break
the
most
glamorous
record
on
the
books
,
Babe_Ruth
's
60
homers
of
1927
.
Mays
'
day
came
a
day
earlier
for
Willie
than
for
the
kids
and
Commies
this
year
.
Willie
's
wonderful
walloping
Sunday
-
four
home_runs
-
served
merely
to
emphasize
how
happy
he
is
to
be
playing
for
Alvin_Dark
.
Next
to
Leo_Durocher
,
Dark
taught
Mays
the
most
when
he
was
a
grass
green
rookie
rushed
up_to
the
Polo_Grounds
10
years
ago
this
month
,
to
help
the
Giants
win
a
dramatic
pennant
.
