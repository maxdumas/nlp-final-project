Northern
liberals
are
the
chief
supporters
of
civil_rights
and
of
integration
.
They
have
also
led
the
nation
in
the
direction
of
a
welfare_state
.
And
both
in
their
objectives
of
non-discrimination
and
of
social
progress
they
have
had
ranged
against
them
the
Southerners
who
are
called
Bourbons
.
The
name
presumably
derives
from
the
French
royal_house
which
never
learned
and
never
forgot
;
since
Bourbon
whiskey
,
though
of
Kentucky
origin
,
is
at_least
as
much
favored
by
liberals
in
the
North
as
by
conservatives
in
the
South
.
The
nature
of
the
opposition
between
liberals
and
Bourbons
is
too
little
understood
in
the
North
.
The
race_problem
has
tended
to
obscure
other
,
less
emotional
,
issues
which
may
fundamentally
be
even
more
divisive
.
It
is
these
other
differences
between
North
and
South
-
other
,
that_is
,
than
those
which
concern
discrimination
or
social_welfare
-
which
I
chiefly
discuss
herein
.
I
write
about
Northern
liberals
from
considerable
personal
experience
.
A
Southerner
married
to
a
New_Englander
,
I
have
lived
for
many
years
in
a
Connecticut
commuting
town
with
a
high
percentage
of
artists
,
writers
,
publicity_men
,
and
business_executives
of
egghead
tastes
.
Most_of
them
are
Democrats
and
nearly
all
consider
themselves
,
and
are
viewed_as
,
liberals
.
This
is
puzzling
to
an
outsider
conscious
of
the
classic
tradition
of
liberalism
,
because
it
is
clear
that
these
Democrats
who
are
left-of-center
are
at
opposite
poles
from
the
liberal
Jefferson
,
who
held
that
the
best
government
was
the
least
government
.
Yet
paradoxically
my
liberal
friends
continue
to
view
Jefferson
as
one
of
their
patron_saints
.
When
I
question
them
as_to
what
they
mean
by
concepts
like
liberty
and
democracy
,
I
find
that
they
fall_into
two
categories
:
the
simpler
ones
who
have
simply
accepted
the
shibboleths
of
their
faith
without
analysis
;
and
the
intelligent
,
cynical
ones
who
scornfully
reply
that
these
things
do
n't
count
any_more
in
the
world
of
to-day
.
I
am
naive
,
they
say
,
to
make
use
of
such
words
.
I
take
this
to
mean
that
the
intelligent
-
and
therefore
necessarily
cynical
?
-
liberal
considers
that
the
need
for
a
national
economy
with
controls
that
will
assure
his
conception
of
social
justice
is
so
great
that
individual
and
local
liberties
as_well_as
democratic
processes
may
have
to
yield
before
it
.
This
seems
like
an
attitude
favoring
a
sort
of
totalitarian
bureaucracy
which
,
under
a
President
of
the
same
stamp
,
would
try
to
coerce
an
uncooperative
Congress
or
Supreme_Court
.
As
for
states
'
rights
,
they
have
never
counted
in
the
thinking
of
my
liberal
friends
except
as
irritations
of
a
minor
and
immoral
nature
which
exist
now
only
as
anachronisms
.
The
American
liberal
may
,
in
the
world
of
to-day
,
have
a
strong
case
;
but
he
presents
it
publicly
so
enmeshed
in
hypocrisy
that
it
is
not
an
honest
one
.
Why
,
in_the_first_place
,
call
himself
a
liberal
if
he
is
against
laissez-faire
and
favors
an
authoritarian
central
government
with
womb-to-tomb
controls
over
everybody
?
If
he
attaches
little
importance
to
personal
liberty
,
why
not
make
this
known
to
the
world
?
And
if
he
is
so
scornful
of
the
rights
of
states
,
why
not
advocate
a
different
sort
of
constitution
that
he
could
more
sincerely
support
?
I
am
concerned
here
,
however
,
with
the
Northern
liberal
's
attitude
toward
the
South
.
It
appears
to
be
one
of
intense
dislike
,
which
he
makes
little
effort
to
conceal
even
in
the
presence
of
Southern
friends
.
His
assumption
seems
to
be
that
any
such
friends
,
being
tolerable
humans
,
must
be
more
liberal
than
most
Southerners
and
therefore
at_least
partly
in_sympathy_with
his
views
.
Time
's
editor
,
Thomas_Griffith
,
in
his
book
,
The
Waist
High
Culture
,
wrote
:
``
most
of
what
was
different
about
it
(
the
Deep_South
)
I
found
myself
unsympathetic
to
''
.
This
,
for
the
liberals
I
know
,
would
be
an
understatement
.
Theirs
is
no
mere
lack
of
sympathy
,
but
something
closer
to
the
passionate
hatred
that
was
directed
against
Fascism
.
I
do
not
think
that
my
experience
would
be
typical
for
Southerners
living
in
the
North
.
In
business
circles
,
usually
conservative
,
this
sort
of
atmosphere
would
hardly
be
found
.
But
in
our
case
-
and
neither
my
wife
nor
I
have
extreme
views
on
integration
,
nor
are
we
given
to
emotional
outbursts
-
the
situation
has
ruined
one
or
two
valued
friendships
and
come_close
to
wrecking
several
more
.
In_fact
it
has
caused
us
to
give
serious
thought
to
moving
our
residence
south
,
because
it
is
not
easy
for
the
most
objective
Southerner
to
sit
calmly
by
when
his
host
is
telling
a
roomful
of
people
that
the
only
way
to
deal
with
Southerners
who
oppose
integration
is
to
send
in
troops
and
shoot
the
bastards
down
.
Accounts
have
been
published
of
Northern
liberals
in
the
South
up_against
segregationist
prejudice
,
especially
in
state-supported
universities
where
pressure
may
be
strong
to
uphold
the
majority
view
.
But
these
accounts
do
not
show
that
Northerners
have
been
subjected
to
embarrassment
or
provocation
by
Yankee
hatred
displayed
in
social
gatherings
.
From
my
wife
's
experience
and
other
sources
,
this
seems
to
be
rarely
encountered
in
educated
circles
.
The
strong
feeling
is
certainly
there
;
but
there
is
a
leavening
of
liberalism
among
college
graduates
throughout
the
South
,
especially
among
those
who
studied
in
the
North
.
And
social_relations
arising
out
of
business
ties
impose
courtesy
,
if
not
sympathy
,
toward
resident
and
visiting
Northerners
.
Also
,
among
the
latter
a
large
percentage
soon
acquire
the
prevalent
Southern
attitude
on
most
social
problems
.
There
are
of_course
many
Souths
;
but
for
this
discussion
the
most
important
division
is
between
those
who
have
been
reconstructed
and
those
who
have
n't
.
My
definition
of
this
much
abused
adjective
is
that
a
reconstructed
rebel
is
one
who
is
glad
that
the
North
won
the
War
.
Nobody
knows
how
many
Southerners
there
are
in
this
category
.
I
suspect
that
there
are
far
more
unreconstructed
ones
than
the
North
likes
to
believe
.
I
never
heard
of
a
poll
being
taken
on
the
question
.
No_doubt
such
a
thing
would
be
considered
unpatriotic
.
Prior
to
1954
I
imagine
that
a
majority
of
Southerners
would
have
voted
against
the
Confederacy
.
Since
the
Supreme_Court
's
decision
of
that
year
this
is
more
doubtful
;
and
if
a
poll
had
been
taken
immediately
following
the
dispatch
of
troops
to
Little_Rock
I
believe
the
majority
would
have
been
for
the
Old_South
.
Belief
in
the
traditional
way_of_life
persists
much
more
in
the
older
states
than
in
the
new
ones
.
Probably
a
larger
percentage
of
Virginians
and
South_Carolinians
remain
unreconstructed
than
elsewhere
,
with
Georgia
,
North_Carolina
,
and
Alabama
following
along
after
them
.
Old
attitudes
are
held
more
tenaciously
in
the
Tidewater
than
the
Piedmont
;
so_that
a
line
running
down
the
length
of
the
South
marking
the
upper_limits
of
tidewater
would
roughly
divide
the
Old_South
from
the
new
,
but
with
,
of_course
,
important
minority
enclaves
.
The
long
settled
areas
of
states
like
Virginia
and
South_Carolina
developed
the
ante-bellum
culture
to
its
richest
flowering
,
and
there
the
memory
is
more
precious
,
and
the
consciousness
of
loss
the
greater
.
Also
,
we
should
not
even
to-day
discount
the
fact
that
a
region
such_as
the
coastal
lowlands
centering_on
Charleston
had
closer
ties
with
England
and
the
West_Indies
than
with
the
North
even
after
independence
.
The
social
and
psychological
consequences
of
this
continue
to
affect
the
area
.
In
certain
respects
defeat
increased
the
persistent
Anglophilia
of
the
Old_South
.
Poor
where
they
had
once
been
rich
,
humbled
where
they
had
been
arrogant
,
having
no_longer
any
hope
of
sharing_in
the
leadership
of
the
nation
,
the
rebels
who
would
not
surrender
in
spirit
drew
comfort
from
the
sympathy
they
felt
extended
to
them
by
the
mother_country
.
And
no_doubt
many
people
in
states
like
the
Carolinas
and
Georgia
,
which
were
among
the
most
Tory
in
sentiment
in
the
eighteenth
century
,
bitterly
regretted
the
revolt
against
the
Crown
.
Among
Bourbons
the
racial
issue
may
have
less
to
do
with
their
remaining
unreconstructed
than
other
factors
.
All
Southerners
agree
that
slavery
had
to
go
;
but
many
historians
maintain
that
except
for
Northern
meddling
it
would
have
ended
in
states
like
Virginia
years
before
it
did
.
Southern
resentment
has
been
over
the
method
of
its
ending
,
the
invasion
,
and
Reconstruction
;
their
fears
now
are
of
miscegenation
and
Negro
political
control
in
many
counties
.
But
apart
from
racial
problems
,
the
old
unreconstructed
South
-
to
use
the
moderate
words
favored
by
Mr._Thomas_Griffith
-
finds
itself
unsympathetic
to
most
of
what
is
different
about
the
civilization
of
the
North
.
And
this
,
in_effect
,
means
most
of
modern
America
.
It
is
hard
to
see
how
the
situation
could
be
otherwise
.
And
therein
,
I
feel
,
many
Northerners
delude
themselves
about
the
South
.
For_one_thing
,
this
is
not
a
subject
often
discussed
or
analyzed
.
There
seems
to
be
almost
a
conspiracy
of
silence
veiling
it
.
I
suppose
the
reason
is
a
kind
of
wishful_thinking
:
do
n't
talk_about
the
final
stages
of
Reconstruction
and
they
will
take_care
of
themselves
.
Or_else
the
North
really
believes
that
all
Southerners
except
a_few
quaint
old
characters
have
come_around
to
realizing
the
errors
of
their
past
,
and
are
now
at_heart
sharers
of
the
American_Dream
,
like
everybody
else
.
If
the
circumstances
are
faced
frankly
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
this
to
be
true
.
The
situation
of
the
South
since
1865
has
been
unique
in
the
western
world
.
Regardless_of
rights
and
wrongs
,
a
population
and
an
area
appropriate
to
a
pre
World_War_I
,
great_power
have
been
,
following
conquest
,
ruled
against
their
will
by
a
neighboring
people
,
and
have
had
imposed
upon
them
social
and
economic
controls
they
dislike
.
And
the
great
majority
of
these
people
are
of
Anglo-Saxon
or
Celtic
descent
.
This
is
the
only
case
in
modern
history
of
a_people
of
Britannic
origin
submitting
without
continued
struggle
to
what
they
view_as
foreign
domination
.
The
fact
is_due
mainly
to
international
wars
,
both
hot
and
cold
.
In
every
war
of
the
United_States
since
the
Civil_War
the
South
was
more
belligerent
than
the
rest
of
the
country
.
So
instead
of
being
tests
of
the
South
's
loyalty
,
the
Spanish_War
,
the
two
World_Wars
,
and
the
Korean_War
all
served
to
overcome
old
grievances
and
cement
reunion
.
And
there
is
no
section
of
the
nation
more
ardent
than
the
South
in
the
cold_war
against
Communism
.
Had
the
situation
been
reversed
,
had
,
for_instance
,
England
been
the
enemy
in
1898
because
of
issues
of
concern
chiefly
to
New_England
,
there
is
little
doubt
that
large_numbers
of
Southerners
would
have
happily
put_on
their
old
Confederate
uniforms
to
fight
as
allies
of
Britain
.
It
is
extraordinary
that
a_people
as
proud
and
warlike
as
Southerners
should
have
been
as
docile
as
they
have
.
The
North
should
thank_its_stars
that
such
has
been
the
case
;
but
at_the_same_time
it
should
not
draw
false
inferences
therefrom
.
The
two
main
charges
levelled
against
the
Bourbons
by
liberals
is
that
they
are
racists
and
social
reactionaries
.
There
is
much
truth
in
both
these
charges
,
and
not
many
Bourbons
deny
them
.
Whatever
their
faults
,
they
are
not
hypocrites
.
Most_of
them
sincerely
believe
that
the
Anglo-Saxon
is
the
best
race
in
the
world
and
that
it
should
remain
pure
.
Many
Northerners
believe
this
,
too
,
but
few
of
them
will
say
so
publicly
.
The
Bourbon
economic
philosophy
,
moreover
,
is
not
very
different
from
that
of
Northern
conservatives
.
But
those
among
the
Bourbons
who
remain
unreconstructed
go
much
further
than
this
.
They
believe
that
if
the
South
had
been
let_alone
it
would
have
produced
a
civilization
superior
to
that
of
modern
America
.
As_it_is
,
they
consider
that
the
North
is
now
reaping
the
fruits
of
excess
egalitarianism
,
that
in_spite_of
its
high
standard_of_living
the
``
American
way
''
has
been
proved
inferior
to
the
English
and
Scandinavian
ways
,
although
they
disapprove
of
the
socialistic
features
of
the
latter
.
The
South
's
antipathy
to
Northern
civilization
includes
such
charges
as
poor
manners
,
harsh
accents
,
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
arts
of
living
like
gastronomy
and
the
use
of
leisure
.
Their
own
easier
,
slower
tempo
is
especially
dear
to
Southerners
;
and
I
have
heard
many
say
that
they
are
content
to
earn
a
half
or
a
third
as_much_as
they
could
up
North
because
they
so
much
prefer
the
quieter
habits
of
their
home_town
.
