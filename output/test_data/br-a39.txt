When
Mickey_Charles_Mantle
,
the
New_York
Yankees
'
man
of
muscle
,
drives
a
home_run
450
feet
into
the
bleachers
,
his
feat
touches
upon
the_sublime
.
When
Roger_Eugene_Maris
,
Mantle
's
muscular
teammate
,
powers
four
home_runs
in
a
double-header
,
his
performance
merits
awe
.
But
when
tiny
,
145
-
pound
Albert_Gregory_Pearson
of
the
Los_Angeles
Angels
,
who
once
caught
three
straight
fly_balls
in
center
field
because
,
as
a
teammate
explained
,
``
the
other
team
thought
no
one
was
out
there
''
,
hits
seven
home_runs
in
four
months
(
three
more_than
his
total
in
1958
,
1959
,
and
1960
)
,
his
achievement
borders_on
the
ridiculous
.
This
is
Baseball
1961
.
This
is
the
year
home_runs
ranged
from
the_sublime
to
the
ridiculous
.
It
is
the
year
when
(
1
)
amiable
Jim_Gentile
of
the
Baltimore_Orioles
ambled
to
the
plate
in
consecutive
innings
with
the
bases
loaded
and
,
in
unprecedented
style
,
delivered
consecutive
grand-slam
home_runs
;
(
2
)
Willie_Mays
of
the
San_Francisco
Giants
borrowed
a
teammate
's
bat
and
became
the
ninth
big_leaguer
to
stroke
four
home_runs
in
a
game
;
(
3
)
the
Milwaukee_Braves
tied
a
major-league
record
with
fourteen
home_runs
in
three
games
and
lost
two
of
them
;
and
(
4
)
catcher
Johnny_Blanchard
of
the
New_York
Yankees
matched
a
record
with
home_runs
in
four
successive
times
at
bat
,
two
of
them
as
a
pinch-hitter
.
Pitchers
grumble
about
lively
balls
and
lively
bats
,
the
shrinking
strike
zone
,
and
the
fact
that
the
knock-down
pitch
is
now
illegal
.
Experts
point
to
the
thinning
of
pitching
talent
in
the
American_League
caused
by
expansion
.
Whatever
the
reasons
,
not
in
30
years
has
a
single
season
produced
such
thunderous
assaults
upon
the
bureau
of
baseball
records
,
home-run
division
.
Of
all
the
records
in
peril
,
one
stands
apart
,
dramatic
in
its
making
,
dramatic
in
its
endurance
,
and
now
,
doubly
dramatic
in
its
jeopardy
.
This
,
of_course
,
is
baseball
's
most
remarkable
mark
:
The
60
home_runs
hit
in
1927
by
the
incorrigible
epicure
,
the
incredible
athlete
,
George_Herman
(
Babe
)
Ruth
of
the
Yankees
.
Since
1927
,
fewer
than
a
dozen
men
have
made
serious
runs
at
Babe_Ruth
's
record
and
each
,
in_turn
,
has
been
thwarted
.
What
ultimately
frustrated
every
challenger
was
Ruth
's
amazing
September
surge
.
In
the
final
month
of
the
1927
season
,
he
hit
seventeen
home_runs
,
a
closing
spurt
never
matched
.
Always
,
in
the
abortive
attacks
upon
Ruth
's
record
,
one
man
alone
-
a
Jimmy_Foxx
(
58
in
1932
)
or
a
Hank_Greenberg
(
58
in
1938
)
or
a
Hack_Wilson
(
56
in
1930
)
-
made
the
bid
.
But
now
,
for_the_first_time
since
Lou_Gehrig
(
with
47
home_runs
)
spurred
Ruth
on
in
1927
,
two
men
playing
for
the
same
team
have
zeroed_in
on
60
.
Their
names
are
Mantle
and
Maris
,
their
team
is
the
Yankees
,
and
their
threat
is
real
.
After
108
games
in
1927
,
Ruth
had
35
home_runs
.
After
108
games
in
1961
,
Mickey_Mantle
has
43
,
Roger_Maris
41
.
Extend
Mantle
's
and
Maris
's
present
paces
over
the
full
1961
schedule
of
162
games
,
and
,
mathematically
,
each
will
hit
more_than
60
home_runs
.
This
is
the
great
edge
the
two
Yankees
have
going_for
them
.
To
better
Ruth
's
mark
,
neither
needs
a
spectacular
September
flourish
.
All
Mantle
needs
is
eight
more
home_runs
in
August
and
ten
in
September
,
and
he
will
establish
a
new
record
.
In
Ruth
's
day
-
and
until
this
year
-
the
schedule
was
154
games
.
Baseball
commissioner
Ford_Frick
has
ruled
that
Ruth
's
record
will
remain
official
unless
it
is
broken_in
154
games
.
)
``
Even
on
the
basis
of
154
games
,
this
is
the
ideal
situation
''
,
insists
Hank_Greenberg
,
now
vice-president
of
the
Chicago_White_Sox
.
``
It
has_to
be
easier
with
two
of
them
.
How
can
you
walk
Maris
to
get_to
Mantle
''
?
Neither
Mantle
nor
Maris
,
understandably
,
will
predict
60
home_runs
for
himself
.
Although
both
concede
they
would
like
to
hit
60
,
they
stick
primarily
to
the
baseball_player
's
standard
quote
:
``
The
important
thing
is
to
win
the
pennant
''
.
But
one
thing
is
for_certain
:
There
is
no
dissension
between
Mantle
,
the
American_League
's
Most_Valuable_Player
in
1956
and
1957
,
and
Maris
,
the
MVP
in
1960
.
Each
enjoys
seeing
the
other
hit
home_runs
(
``
I
hope
Roger
hits
80
''
,
Mantle
says
)
,
and
each
enjoys
even
more
seeing
himself
hit
home_runs
(
``
and
I
hope
I
hit
81
''
)
.
The
sluggers
get_along
so
well
in_fact
,
that
with
their
families
at_home
for
the
summer
(
Mantle
's
in
Dallas
,
Maris
's
in
Kansas_City
)
,
they
are
rooming
together
.
Mantle
,
Maris
,
and
Bob_Cerv
,
a
utility
outfielder
,
share
an
apartment
in
Jamaica
,
Long_Island
,
not
far
from
New_York
International_Airport
.
The
three
pay
$
251
a
month
for
four
rooms
(
kitchen
,
dining_room
,
living_room
,
and
bedroom
)
,
with
air-conditioning
and
new
modern
furniture
.
Mantle
and
Cerv
use
the
twin_beds
in
the
bedroom
;
Maris
sleeps
on
a
green
studio_couch
in
the
living_room
.
They
divide
up
the
household
chores
:
Cerv
does
most_of
the
cooking
(
breakfast
and
sandwich
snacks
,
with
dinner
out
)
,
Mantle
supplies
the
transportation
(
a
white
1961
Oldsmobile
convertible
)
,
and
Maris
drives
the
25
-
minute
course
from
the
apartment
house
to
Yankee_Stadium
.
Mantle
,
Maris
,
and
Cerv
probably
share
one
major-league
record
already
:
Among
them
,
they
have
fifteen
children
-
eight
for
Cerv
,
four
for
Mantle
,
and
three
for
Maris
.
As
roommates
,
teammates
,
and
home-run
mates
,
Mantle
,
29
,
who
broke_in
with
the
Yankees
ten
years
ago
,
and
Maris
,
26
,
who
came
to
the
Yankees
from
Kansas_City
two
years
ago
,
have
strikingly
similar
backgrounds
.
Both
were
scholastic
stars
in
football
,
basketball
,
and
baseball
(
Mantle
in
Commerce
,
Okla.
,
Maris
in
Fargo
,
N.
D
.
)
;
as
halfbacks
,
both
came_close
to
playing
football
at
the
University
of
Oklahoma
(
``
Sometimes
in
the
minors
''
,
Maris
recalls
,
``
I
wished
I
had
gone_to
Oklahoma
''
)
.
To
an
extent
,
the
two
even
look
alike
.
Both
have
blue
eyes
and
short
blond
hair
.
Both
are
6
feet
tall
and
weigh
between
195
and
200
pounds
,
but
Mantle
,
incredibly
muscular
(
he
has
a
17
-
1
2
-
inch
neck
)
,
looks
bigger
.
With
their
huge
backs
and
overdeveloped
shoulders
,
both
must
have
their
clothes
made
to_order
.
Maris
purchases
$
100
suits
from
Simpson
's
in
New_York
.
Mantle
,
more
concerned
with
dress
,
buys
his
suits
four
at_a_time
at
Neiman-Marcus
in
Dallas
and
pays
as
much_as
$
250
each
.
Neither
Mantle
nor
Maris
need
fear
being
classified
an
intellectual
,
but
lately
Mantle
has
shown
unusual
devotion
to
an
intellectual
opus
,
Henry_Miller
's
``
Tropic_of_Cancer
''
.
Mantle
so
appreciated
Miller
's
delicate
literary
style
that
he
broadened
teammates
'
minds
by
reading
sensitive
passages
aloud
during
road
trips
.
Mantle
is
not
normally
given
to
public_speaking
-
or
,
for_that_matter
,
to
private
speaking
.
``
What
do
you
and
Mickey
talk_about
at_home
''
?
a
reporter
asked
Maris
recently
.
``
To
tell
you
the
truth
''
,
Maris
said
,
``
Mickey
do
n't
talk
much
''
.
This
is
no
surprising
trait
for
a
ballplayer
.
What
is
surprising
and
pleasant
is
that
Mantle
and
Maris
,
under
constant
pressure
from
writers
and
photographers
,
are
trying
to
be
cooperative
.
Of
the
two
,
Mantle
is
by
nature
the
less
outgoing
,
Maris
the
more
outspoken
.
But
last
week
,
when
a
reporter
was_standing
near
Mantle
's
locker
,
Mickey
walked
up
and
volunteered
an
anecdote
.
``
See
that
kid
''
?
he
said
,
pointing
to
a
dark-haired
11
-
year-old
boy
.
``
That
's
[
Yogi
]
Berra
's
.
I
'll
never
forget
one_time
I
struck_out
three_times
,
dropped
a
fly_ball
,
and
we
lost
the
game
.
I
came_back
,
sitting
by
my
locker
,
feeling
real
low
,
and
the
kid
walks
over
to
me
,
looks
up
,
and
says
:
'
You
stunk
''
'
.
Maris
,
in
talking
to
reporters
,
tries
to
answer
all
questions
candidly
and
fully
,
but
on
rare
occasions
,
he
shuns
newsmen
.
``
When
I
've
made
a
dumb
play
''
,
he
says
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
talk
to
anyone
.
I
'm
angry
''
.
By
his
own
confession
,
Maris
is
an
angry
young_man
.
Benched
at
Tulsa
in
1955
,
he
told
manager
Dutch
Meyer
:
``
I
can
n't
play
for
you
.
Send
me
where
I
can
play
''
.
(
Meyer
sent
him
to
Reading
,
Pa.
.
)
Benched
at
Indianapolis
in
1956
,
he
told
manager
Kerby_Farrell
:
``
I
'm
not
learning
anything
on
the
bench
.
Play
me
''
.
(
Farrell
did
-
and
Maris
led
the
team
to
victory
in
the
Little
World_Series
.
)
``
That
's
the
way
I
am
''
,
he
says
.
``
I
tell
people
what
I
think
.
If
you
're
a
good
ballplayer
,
you
've
got_to
get
mad
.
Give
me
a
team
of
nine
angry
men
and
I
'll
give
you
a
team
of
nine
gentlemen
and
we
'll
beat
you
nine
out
of
ten
times
''
.
One
good
indication
of
the
two
men
's
personalities
is
the
way
they
reacted
to
meeting
their
own
heroes
.
Maris
's
was
Ted_Williams
.
``
When
I
was
a
kid
''
,
Maris
told
a
sportswriter
last
week
,
``
I
used_to
follow
Williams
every_day
in
the
box
score
,
just
to
see
whether
he
got
a
hit
or
not
''
.
``
When
you
came_up
to
the
majors
,
did
you
seek_out
Williams
for
advice
''
?
``
Are
you
kidding
''
?
said
Maris
.
``
You
're
afraid
to
talk
to
a
guy
you
idolize
''
.
Mantle
's
hero
was
Joe_DiMaggio
.
``
When
Mickey
went
to
the
Yankees
''
,
says
Mark_Freeman
,
an
ex-Yankee
pitcher
who
sells
mutual_funds
in
Denver
,
``
DiMaggio
still
was
playing
and
every_day
Mickey
would
go_by
his
locker
,
just
aching
for
some
word
of
encouragement
from
this
great
man
,
this
hero
of
his
.
But
DiMaggio
never
said
a
word
.
It
crushed
Mickey
.
He
told
me
he
vowed
right_then
that
if
he
ever
got_to
be
a
star
,
this
never
would
be
said
of
him
''
.
Mantle
has
kept
the
vow
.
Among
all
the
Yankees
,
he
is
the
veteran
most
friendly
to
rookies
.
Neither
Mantle
nor
Maris
is
totally
devoted_to
baseball
above_all
else
.
If
laying
ties
on
a
railroad_track
,
which
he
once
did
for
$
1
an
hour
,
paid
more_than
playing
right
field
for
the
Yankees
,
Maris
would
lay
ties
on
a
railroad_track
.
If
working
in
a
zinc
mine
,
which
he
once
did
for
87
-
1
2
cents
an
hour
,
paid
more_than
playing
center
field
for
the
Yankees
,
Mantle
would
work
in
a
zinc
mine
.
But
since
railroading
and
mining
are
not
the
highest
paid
arts
,
Mantle
and
Maris
concentrate_on
baseball
.
They
try
to
play
baseball
the
best
they
can
.
Each
is
a
complete
ballplayer
.
Mantle
,
beyond
any
question
,
can
do
more
things
well
.
(
``
One
of
the
reasons
they
get_along
fine
''
,
says
a
sportswriter
who
is
friendly
with
the
two
men
,
``
is
that
both
realize
Mantle
is
head-and-shoulders
above
Maris
''
.
)
Hitting
,
Mantle
has
an
immediate
advantage
because
he
bats
both
left-handed
and
right-handed
,
Maris
only
left-handed
.
They
both
possess
near
classic
stances
,
dug_in
firmly
,
arms
high
,
set
for
fierce
swings
.
Mantle
is
considerably
better
hitting
for
average
(
.332
,
fourth
in
the
league
,
to
.280
for
Maris
so_far
this
year
)
.
Both
are
good
bunters
:
Maris
once
beat_out
eighteen
of
nineteen
in
the
minor_leagues
;
Mantle
is
a
master
at
dragging_a_bunt
toward
first_base
.
Both
have
brilliant
speed
:
Mantle
was
timed
from
home_plate
(
batting
left-handed
)
to
first_base
in
3.1
seconds
,
faster
than
any
other
major_leaguer
;
Maris
ran
the
100
-
yard
dash
in
ten
seconds
in
high_school
and
once
won
a
race
against
Luis_Aparicio
,
the
swift
,
base-stealing
shortstop
of
the
White_Sox
.
Both
are
good
,
daring
fielders
:
Mantle
covers
more
ground
;
Maris
's
throwing
arm
is
stronger
.
Yet
with
all
their
skills
,
the
appeal
of
Mantle
and
Maris
in
1961
comes_down
to
one
basic
:
The
home_run
.
With
this
ultimate
weapon
,
the
two
Yankees
may
have
saved
baseball
from
its
dullest
season
.
(
American_League
expansion
created
,
inevitably
,
weaker
teams
.
Only
two
teams
in
each
league
[
the
Yankees
and
Detroit
,
the
Dodgers
and
Cincinnati
]
are
battling
for
first
place
.
Appropriately
,
the
emphasis
on
the
home_run
,
at
a
peak
this
year
,
came_into_being
at
baseball
's
lowest
moment
.
In
1920
,
as
the
startling
news
that
the
1919
White_Sox
had
conspired
to
lose
the
World_Series
leaked_out
,
fans
grew
disillusioned
and
disinterested
in
baseball
.
Something
was
needed
to
revive
interest
;
the
something
was
the
home_run
.
