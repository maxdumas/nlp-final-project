The
first
rattle
of
the
machine_guns
,
at
7
:
10
in
the
evening
,
roused
around
me
the
varied
voices
and
faces
of
fear
.
``
Sounds
exactly
like
last
time
''
.
The
young_man
spoke
steadily
enough
,
but
all_at_once
he
looked
grotesquely
unshaven
.
The
middle-aged
man
said
over_and_over
,
``
Why
did
I
come
here
,
why
did
I
come
here
''
.
Then
he
was
sick
.
Amid
the
crackle
of
small_arms
and
automatic
weapons
,
I
heard
the
thumping
of
mortars
.
Then
the
lights
went_out
.
This
was
my
second
day
in
Vientiane
,
the
administrative
capital
of
Laos
,
and
my
thoughts
were
none
too
brave
.
Where
was
my
flashlight
?
Where
should
I
go
?
To
my
room
?
Better
stay
in
the
hotel
lobby
,
where
the
walls
looked
good
and
thick
.
Chinese
and
Indian
merchants
across
the
street
were
slamming
their
steel
shutters
.
Hotel
attendants
pulled
parked
bicycles
into
the
lobby
.
A
woman
with
a
small
boy
slipped
in
between
them
.
``
Please
''
,
she
said
,
``
please
''
.
She
held_out
her
hand
to
show
that
she
had
money
.
The
American
newspaperman
worried
about
getting
to
the
cable
office
.
But
what
was
the
story
?
Had
the
Communist
led
Pathet_Lao
finally
come
this
far
?
Or
was
it
another
revolt
inside
Vientiane
?
``
Let
's
play
hero
''
,
I
said
.
``
Let
's
go
to
the
roof
and
see
''
.
By
7
:
50
the
answer
was
plain
.
There
had
been
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
.
A
traditional
Lao
explanation
is
that
the
moon
was
being
swallowed
by
a
toad
,
and
the
remedy
was
to
make
all
possible
noise
,
ideally
with
firearms
.
The
din
was
successful
,
too
,
for
just
before
the
moon
disappeared
,
the
frightened
toad
had
begun
to
spit
it
out
again
,
which
meant
good_luck
all
around
.
How
quaint
it
all
seemed
the
next
day
.
A
restaurant
posted
a
reminder
to
patrons
``
who
became
excited
and
left
without
paying
their
checks
''
.
But
everyone
I
met
had
sought
cover
first
and
asked
questions
later
.
And
no
wonder
,
for
Vientiane
,
the
old
City
of
Sandalwood
,
had
become
the
City
of
Bullet_Holes
.
I
saw
holes
in
planes
at
the
airport
and
in
cars
in
the
streets
.
Along
the
main
thoroughfares
hardly_a
house
had
not
been
peppered
.
In
place
of
the
police_headquarters
was
a
new
square
filled
with
rubble
.
Mortars
had
demolished
the
defense
ministry
and
set
fire
to
the
American
Embassy
next_door
.
What
had
been
the
ambassador
's
suite
was
now
jagged
walls
of
blackened
brick
.
This
damage
had
been
done
in
the
battle
of
Vientiane
,
fought
less_than
three
months
earlier
when
four
successive
governments
had
ruled
here
in
three
days
(
December
9
-
11
,
1960
)
.
And
now
,
in
March
,
all
Laos
suffered
a
state
of
siege
.
The
Pathet_Lao
forces
held
two
northern
provinces
and
openly
took
the
offensive
in
three
more
.
Throughout
the
land
their
hit-and-run
terrorists
spread
fear
of
ambush
and
death
.
``
And
it
's
all
the
more
tragic
because
it
's
so
little
deserved
''
,
said
Mr._J._J._A._Frans
,
a
Belgian
official
of
the
United_Nations
Educational_,_Scientific_,_and_Cultural_Organization
.
We
talked
after
I
hailed
his
Jeep
marked
with
the
U._N.
flag
.
Practically
all
the
people
of
Laos
,
he
explained
-
about
two
million
of
them
-
are
rice
farmers
,
and
the
means
and
motives
of
modern
war
are
as
strange
to
them
as
clocks
and
steel
plows
.
They
look_after
their
fields
and
children
and
water_buffaloes
in
ten
or
eleven
thousand
villages
,
with
an
average
of
200
souls
.
Nobody
can
tell
more
closely
how
many
villages
there
are
.
They
spread
over
an
area
no
larger
than
Oregon
;
yet
they
include
peoples
as
different
from
one
another
as
Oregonians
are
from
Patagonians
.
``
What
matters
here
is
family
loyalty
;
faith
in
the_Buddha
and
staying
at
peace
with
the
phis
,
the
spirits
;
and
to
live
in
harmony
with
nature
''
.
Harmony
in
Laos
?
``
Precisely
''
,
said
Mr._Frans
.
He
spoke_of
the
season
of
dryness
and
dust
,
brought
by
the
monsoon
from
the
northeast
,
in_harmony
with
the
season
of
rain
and
mud
,
brought
by
the
monsoon
from
the
southwest
.
The
slim
pirogues
in_harmony
with
the
majestically
meandering
Mekong_River
.
Shy
,
slender-waisted
girls
at
the
loom
in_harmony
with
the
frangipani
by
the
wayside
.
Even
life
in_harmony
with
death
.
For
so_long_as
death
was
not
violent
,
it
was
natural
and
to
be
welcomed
,
making
a
funeral
a
feast
.
To
many_a
Frenchman
-
they
came
95
years
ago
,
colonized
,
and
stayed
until
Laos
became
independent
in
1953
-
the
land
had
been
even
more
delightfully
tranquil
than
Tahiti
.
Yet
Laos
was
now
one
of
the
most
explosive
headaches
of
statesmen
around
the
globe
.
The
Pathet_Lao
,
stiffened
by
Communist
Veterans
from
neighboring
North
Viet_Nam
,
were
supplied
by
Soviet
aircraft
.
The
Royal_Lao_Army
,
on_the
other
hand
,
was
paid
and
equipped
with
American
funds
.
In
six
years
,
U._S.
aid
had
amounted
to
more_than
$
1.60
for
each
American
-
a
total
of
three
hundred
million
dollars
.
We
were
there
at
a
moment
when
the
situation
in
Laos
threatened
to
ignite
another
war
among
the
world
's
giants
.
Even
if
it
did
not
,
how
would
this
little
world
of
gentle
people
cope
with
its
new
reality
of
grenades
and
submachine_guns
?
To
find_out
,
we
traveled
throughout
that
part
of
Laos
still
nominally
controlled
,
in
the
daytime
at_least
,
by
the
Royal_Lao_Army
:
from
Attopeu
,
the
City
of
Buffalo
Dung
in
the
southeast
,
to
Muong_Sing
,
the
City
of
Lions
in
the
northwest
,
close
to
Communist_China
(
map
,
page
250
)
.
We
rode
over
roads
so
rough
that
our
Jeep
came
to
rest
atop
the
soil
between
ruts
,
all
four
wheels
spinning
uselessly
.
We
flew
in
rickety
planes
so
overloaded
that
we
wondered
why
they
did
n't
crash
.
In_the_end
we
ran_into
Communist
artillery_fire
.
``
We
''
were
Bill_Garrett
of
the
National_Geographic
Illustrations_Staff
,
whose
three
cameras
and
eight
lenses
made
him
look
as
formidable
as
any
fighting
man
we
met
;
Boun_My
,
our
interpreter
;
and
myself
.
Boun_My
-
the
name
means
one
who
has
a
boun
,
a
celebration
,
and
is
therefore
lucky
-
was
born
in
Savannakhet
,
the
Border
of
Paradise
.
He
had
attended
three
universities
in
the
United_States
.
But
he
had
never
seen
the
mountainous
half
of
his
native_land
north
of
Vientiane
,
including
the
royal
capital
,
Luang_Prabang
.
Before
the
airplanes
came
,
he
said
,
travel
in
Laos
was
just_about
impossible
.
Alas
,
so
it
almost
proved
for
us
,
too
.
To
go
outside
the
few
cities
required
permits
.
and
getting
them
seemed
a
life
's
work
.
Nobody
wanted
Americans
to
be
hurt
or
captured
,
and
few
soldiers
could
be
spared
as
escorts
.
We
were
told
that
to
the
Pathet_Lao
,
a
kidnaped
American
was
worth
at_least
$
750
,
a
fortune
in
Laos
.
Everyone
had
heard
of
the
American
contractor
who
had
spurned
an
escort
.
Now
Pathet_Lao
propagandists
were
reported
marching
him
barefoot
from
village
to
village
,
as
evidence
of
evil
American
intervention
.
Although
we
enjoyed
our
rounds
of
the
government_offices
in
Vientiane
,
with
officials
offering
tea
and
pleasing
conversation
in
French
,
we
were
getting
nowhere
.
We
had
nearly
decided
that
all
the
tales
of
Lao
lethargy
must
be
true
,
when
we
were
invited
to
take
a
trip
with
the
Prime_Minister
.
Could
we
be
ready
in
15_minutes
?
His
Highness
had
decided
only
two
hours
ago
to
go_out
of
town
,
and
he
was
eager
to
be
off
.
And
so
,
after
a
flight
southeast
to
Savannakhet
,
we
found
ourselves
bouncing
along
in
a
Jeep
right
behind
the
Land-Rover
of
Prince_Boun_Oum
of
Champassak
,
a
tall
man
of
Churchillian
mien
in
a
bush_jacket
and
a
ten-gallon_hat
from
Texas
.
From
his
shoulder_bag
peeked
the
seven
inch
barrel
of
a
Luger
.
The
temperature
rose
to
105
`
.
With
our
company
of
soldiers
,
we
made
one
long
column
of
reddish
dust
.
In
Keng_Kok
,
the
City
of
Silkworms
,
the
Prime_Minister
bought
fried
chickens
and
fried
cicadas
,
and
two
notebooks
for
me
.
Then
we
drove
on
,
until
there
was
no
more
road
and
we
traversed
dry
rice
fields
,
bouncing
across
their
squat
earth
walls
.
It
was
a
spleen
crushing
day
.
An
hour
of
bouncing
,
a
brief
stop
in
a
village
to
inspect
a
new
school
or
dispensary
.
More
bouncing
,
another
stop
,
a
new
house
for
teachers
,
a
new
well
.
Then
off
again
,
rushing
to
keep_up
.
We
were
miserable
.
But
our
two
Jeep
mates
-
Keo_Viphakone
from
Luang_Prabang
and
John_Cool
from
Beaver
,
Pennsylvania
-
were
beaming
under
their
coatings
of
dust
.
Together
they
had
probably
done
more
than
any
other
men
to
help
push
Laos
toward
the
20
th
century
-
constructively
.
Mr._Keo
,
once
a
diplomat
in
Paris
and
Washington
,
was
Commissioner_of_Rural_Affairs
.
John
,
an
engineer
and
anthropologist
with
a
doctorate
from
the
London_School_of_Economics
,
headed
the
rural
development
division
of
USOM
,
the
United_States_Operations_Mission
administering
U._S.
aid
.
``
What
you
see
are
self-help
projects
''
,
John
said
.
``
We
ask
the
people
what
they
want
,
and
they
supply
the
labor
.
We
send
shovels
,
cement
,
nails
,
and
corrugated_iron
for
roofs
.
That
way
they
have
an
infirmary
for
$
400
.
We
have
2500
such
projects
,
and
they
add_up
to
a_lot
more_than
just
roads
and
wells
and
schools
.
Ask
Mr._Keo
''
.
Mr._Keo
agreed
.
``
Our
people
have
been
used_to
accepting
things
as
they
found
them
''
,
he
said
.
``
Where
there
was
no
road
,
they
lived
without
one
.
Now
they
learn
that
men
can
change
their
surroundings
,
through
their
traditional
village
elders
,
without
violence
.
That
's
a
big
step
toward
a
modern
state
.
You
might
say
we
are
in
the
nation
building
business
''
.
In
the
villages
people
lined_up
to
give
us
flowers
.
Then
came
coconuts
,
eggs
,
and
rice
wine
.
The
Prime_Minister
paid
his
respects
to
the
Buddhist
monks
,
strode
rapidly
among
the
houses
,
joked
with
the
local
soldiery
,
and
made
a
speech
.
The
soldiers
are
fighting
and
the
Americans
are
helping
,
he
said
,
but
in
the
fight
against
the
Pathet_Lao
the
key
factor
is
the
villager
himself
.
Then
we
were
off
again
.
We
did
it
for
three
days
.
But
our
stumping
tour
of
the
south
was
n't
all
misery
.
Crossing
the
4000
-
foot
width
of
the
Mekong
at
Champassak
,
on
a
raft
with
an
outboard_motor
,
we
took_off
our
dusty
shirts
and
enjoyed
a
veritable
ocean
breeze
.
Then
we
hung
overboard
in
the
water
.
Briefly
we
rolled
over
a
paved
road
up_to
Pak_Song
,
on
the
cool
Bolovens_Plateau
.
The
Prince
visited
the
hospital
of
Operation
Brotherhood
,
supported
by
the
Junior_Chamber_of_Commerce
of
the
Philippines
,
and
fed
rice
to
two
pet
elephants
he
kept
at
his
residence
at
Pak_Song
.
In
the
village
of
Soukhouma
,
which
means
``
Peaceful
''
,
we
had
a
baci
.
This
is
the
most
endearing
of
Lao
ceremonies
.
It
takes_place
in
the
household
,
a
rite
of
well_wishing
for
myriad
occasions
-
for
the
traveler
,
a
wedding
,
a
newborn
child
,
the
sick
,
the
New
Year
,
for
any
good
purpose
.
The
preparations
were
elaborate
:
flowers
,
candles
,
incense
sticks
,
rice
wine
,
dozens
of
delicacies
,
and
pieces
of
white
cotton
string
.
The
strings
were
draped
around
flowers
in
tall
silver
bowls
(
page
261
)
.
The
candles
were
lighted
,
and
we
sat
on
split
bamboo
mats
among
the
village
notables
.
I
was
careful
to
keep
my
feet
,
the
seat
of
the
least
worthy
spirits
,
from
pointing
at
anyone
's
head
,
where
the
worthiest
spirits
reside
.
Now
a
distinguished
old_man
called_on
nine
divinities
to
come
and
join
us
.
Next
he
addressed
himself
to
our
souls
.
A
man
has
32
souls
,
one
for
each
part
of
the
body
.
Those
souls
like
to
wander
off
,
and
must
be
called
back
.
With
the
divinities
present
and
our
souls
in_place
,
we
were
wished
health
,
happiness
,
and
power
.
Then
,
one_after_another
,
the
villagers
tied
the
waiting
cotton
strings
around
our
wrists
.
These
were
to
be
kept
on
,
to
hold_in
the
32
souls
.
As
we
stepped_out
into
the
sunlight
,
a
man
came_up_to
John_Cool
and
silently
showed
him
his
hand
.
It
had
a
festering
hole
as
big
as
a
silver_dollar
.
We
could
see
maggots
moving
.
John
said
:
``
I
have
some
antiseptic
salve
with
me
,
but
it
's
too
late
for
that
''
.
