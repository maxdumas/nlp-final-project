For
a
second
month
in
a
row
,
Multnomah_County
may
be
short
of
general
assistance
money
in
its
budget
to
handle
an
unusually
high
summer
month
's
need
,
the
state
public
welfare
commission
was
told
Friday
.
It
is
the
only
county
in
the
state
so_far
this
month
reporting
a
possible
shortage
in
GA
category
,
for
which
emergency
allotment
can
be
given
by
the
state
if
necessary
.
William_Smythe
,
director
of
field
service
,
told
the
commissioners
that
Multnomah
,
as
of
Aug.
22
,
had
spent
$
58918
out
of
its
budgeted
$
66000
in
the
category
,
leaving
only
$
7082
for
the
rest
of
the
month
.
At
the
rate
of
need
indicated
in
the
early
weeks
of
the
month
,
this
could
mean
a
shortage
of
as
high
as
$
17000
.
But
it
probably
will
be
less
because
of
a
usual
slackening
during
the
last
weeks
of
each_month
,
Smythe
said
.
No
request
for
emergency
allotment
had
yet
been
received
,
however
.
The
commission
,
meeting
for_the_first_time
with
both
of
its
newly-appointed
commissioners
,
Roy_Webster
,
of
Hood_River
,
and
Dr._Ennis_Keizer
,
of
North_Bend
,
approved
a
year
's
contract
for
a
consultant
in
the
data_processing
department
who
has
been
the
center
of
considerable
controversy
in_the_past
.
The
contract
with
Ray_Field
,
who
has
been
converting
the
agencies
electronic_data_processing
program
to
magnetic_tape
,
would
renew
his
present
salary
of
$
8
an
hour
up_to
a
maximum
of
200
hours
a
month
.
Field
does
the
planning
for
the
machine_operations
and
fiscal
processes
and
the
adapting
of
the
data_processing
system
to
new
programs
as
they
are
made
necessary
by
legislative
and
policy_changes
.
Acting_Administrator_Andrew_F._Juras
said
that
because
of
Field
's
unique
position
and
knowledge
in
the
program
,
the
agency
now
would
be
seriously
handicapped
if
he
was
not
continued
for
a
period
.
But
he
emphasized
that
the
agency
must
train
people
within
its
own
employ
to
fulfill
what
Field
handles
,
and
he
said
he
personally
``
regrets
very_much
that
the
agency
has
not
done
this
in_the_past
''
.
He
pointed_out
to
the
commissioners
that
the
agency
was
literally
dependent
now
on
the
machine
processing
,
``
and
the
whole
wheels
of
the
agency
would
stop
if
it
broke_down
or
the
three
or
four
persons
directing
it
were
to
leave
''
.
Juras
said
he
insisted
Field
be
continued
on
a
consultant
basis
only
and
be
answerable
directly
to
the
administrator
of
the
agency
and
not
to
other
agencies
of
the
government
.
He
also
said
that
the
salary
,
in_terms_of
going
rates
in
the
field
,
was
``
modest
''
in_terms_of
the
man
's
responsibility
.
The
conversion
to
magnetic_tape
is
not_yet
completed
,
he
said
,
and
added
Field
's
long
service
in
state_government
and
welfare
employ
gave
him
familiarity
with
the
welfare
program
.
``
Do
you
feel
you
can
stand_up
to
the
next
legislative
session
and
defend
this
contract
''
?
asked
Mrs._Grace_O._Peck
,
representative
from
Multnomah_County
,
of
the
commission
chairman
,
Joseph_E._Harvey_Jr.
.
``
My
feeling
at
the
moment
''
,
he
said
,
``
is
that
we
have
no
alternative
,
irrespective_of
some
of
the
arguments
about
him
.
The
continued
operation
of_this
program
depends_on
having
his
service
''
.
Mrs._Peck
,
later
joined
by
the
commission
's
vice-chairman
,
Mrs._Lee_Patterson
,
took
Harvey
to
task
for
comments
he
had
made
to
the
North_Portland_Rotary_Club
Tuesday
.
A
publicity
release
from
Oregon_Physicians_Service
,
of_which
Harvey
is
president
,
quoted
him
as
saying
the
welfare
office
move
to
Salem
,
instead
of
``
crippling
''
the
agency
,
had
provided
an
avenue
to
correct
administrative
weaknesses
,
with
the
key
being
improved
communications
between
F
+
A
and
the
commission
staff
.
``
I
rather
resent
''
,
she
said
,
``
you
speaking_to
those
groups
in
Portland
as
though
just
the
move
accomplished
this
.
I
think
you
fell_short
of
the
real
truth
in
the_matter
:
That
the
move
is
working_out
through
the
fine
cooperation
of
the
staff
and
all
the
people
.
The
staff
deserves
a_lot_of
credit
working
down
here
under
real
obstacles
''
.
Harvey
said
his
objective
was
to
create
a
better
public
image
for
welfare
