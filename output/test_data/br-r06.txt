I
called
the
other
afternoon
on
my
old
friend
,
Graves_Moreland
,
the
Anglo-American
literary
critic
-
his
mother
was_born
in
Ohio
-
who
lives
alone
in
a
fairy-tale
cottage
on
the
Upson_Downs
,
raising_hell
and
peacocks
,
the
former
only
when
the
venerable
gentleman
becomes
an
angry
old_man
about
the
state
of
literature
or
something
else
that
is
dwindling
and
diminishing
,
such_as
human
stature
,
hope
,
and
humor
.
My
unscientific
friend
does
not
believe
that
human
stature
is
measurable
in_terms_of
speed
,
momentum
,
weightlessness
,
or
distance
from
earth
,
but
is
a
matter
of
the
development
of
the
human
mind
.
After
Gagarin
became
the
Greatest
Man
in
the
World
,
for
a
nation
that
does
not
believe_in
the
cult_of_personality
or
in
careerism
,
Moreland
wrote
me
a
letter
in
which
he
said
:
``
I
am
not
interested
in
how
long
a
bee
can
live
in
a
vacuum
,
or
how
far
it
can
fly
.
A
bee
's
place
is
in
the
hive
''
.
``
I
have
come
to
talk
with
you
about
the
future
of
humor
and
comedy
''
,
I
told
him
,
at
which
he
started
slightly
,
and_then
made
us
each
a
stiff
drink
,
with
a
trembling
hand
.
``
I
seem
to
remember
''
,
he
said
,
``
that
in
an
interview
ten
years
ago
you
gave
humor
and
comedy
five
years
to
live
.
Did
you
go_to
their
funeral
''
?
``
I
was
wrong
''
,
I
admitted
.
``
Comedy
did
n't
die
,
it
just
went
crazy
.
It
has
identified
itself
with
the
very
tension
and
terror
it
once
did
so
much
to
alleviate
.
We
now
have
not_only
what
has
been
called
over
here
the
comedy
of
menace
but
we
also
have
horror
jokes
,
magazines
known
as
Horror_Comics
,
and
sick
comedians
.
There
are
even
publications
called
Sick
and
Mad
.
The
Zeitgeist
is
not
crazy
as
a
loon
or
mad
as
a
March
hare
;
it
is
manic
as
a
man
''
.
``
I
woke_up
this
morning
''
,
Moreland
said
,
``
paraphrasing
Lewis_Carroll
.
Do
you
want
to
hear
the
paraphrase
''
?
``
Can
I
bear
it
''
?
I
asked
,
taking
a
final
gulp
of
my
drink
,
and
handing
him
the
empty
glass
.
``
Just
barely
''
,
he
said
,
and
repeated
his
paraphrase
:
``
The
time
has
come
''
,
the
walrus
said
,
``
To
speak
of
manic
things
,
Of
shots
and
shouts
,
and
sealing
dooms
Of
commoners
and
kings
''
.
Moreland
fixed
us
each
another
drink
,
and
said
,
``
For
God
's
sake
,
tell
me
something
truly
amusing
''
.
``
I
'll
try
''
,
I
said
,
and
sat
for
a
moment
thinking
.
``
Oh
yes
,
the
other
day
I
reread
some
of
Emerson
's
English_Traits
,
and
there
was
an
anecdote
about
a
group
of
English
and
Americans
visiting
Germany
,
more_than
a_hundred
years
ago
.
In
the
railway_station
at
Berlin
,
a
uniformed
attendant
was
chanting
,
'
Foreigners
this
way
!
Foreigners
this
way
'
!
One
woman
-
she
could
have
been
either
English
or
American
-
went_up
to
him
and
said
,
'
But
you
are
the
foreigners
''
'
.
I
took
a
deep
breath
and
an
even
deeper
swallow
of
my
drink
,
and
said
,
``
I
admit
that
going
back
to
Ralph_Waldo_Emerson
for
humor
is
like
going_to
a
modern
musical_comedy
for
music
and
comedy
''
.
``
What
's
the_matter
with
the
music
''
?
Moreland
asked
.
``
It
does
n't
drown_out
the
dialogue
''
,
I
explained
.
``
Let
's
talk_about
books
''
,
Moreland
said
.
``
I
am
told
that
in
America
you
have
non
books
by
non
writers
,
brought_out
by
non
publishers
for
non
readers
.
Is
it
all
non-fiction
''
?
``
There
is
non-fiction
and
non
non-fiction
''
,
I
said
.
``
Speaking
of
nonism
:
the
other
day
,
in
a
story
about
a
sit-down
demonstration
,
the
Paris_Herald_Tribune
wrote
,
'
The
non
violence
became
noisier
'
.
And_then
Eichmann
was
quoted
as
saying
,
in
non
English
,
that
Hitler
's
plan
to
exterminate
the
Jews
was
nonsense
''
.
``
If
we
cannot
tell
evil
,
horror
,
and
insanity
from
nonsense
,
what
is
the
future
of
humor
and
comedy
''
?
Moreland
asked
,
grimly
.
``
Cryptic
''
,
I
said
.
``
They
require
,
for
existence
,
a
brave
spirit
and
a
high
heart
,
and
where
do
you
find
these
?
In
our
present
era
of
Science
and
Angst
,
the
heart
has
been
downgraded
,
to
use
one
of
our
popular
retrogressive
verbs
''
.
``
I
know
what
you
mean
''
,
Moreland
sighed
.
``
Last
year
your
Tennessee_Williams
told
our
Dilys_Powell
,
in
a
television_program
,
that
it
is
the
task
of
the
playwright
to
throw
light
into
the
dark
corners
of
the
human
heart
.
Like
almost
everybody
else
,
he
confused
the
heart
,
both
as
organ
and
as
symbol
,
with
the
disturbed
psyche
,
the
deranged
glands
,
and
the
jumpy
central_nervous_system
.
I'm
not
pleading
for
the
heart
that
leaps
up
when
it
beholds
a
rainbow
in
the
sky
,
or
for
the
heart
that
with
rapture
fills
and
dances
with
the
daffodils
.
The
sentimental
pure
heart
of
Galahad
is
gone
with
the
knightly
years
,
but
I
still
believe_in
the
heart
of
the
George_Meredith
character
that
was
not
made
of
the
stuff
that
breaks
''
.
``
We
no_longer
have
Tom_Moore
's
and
Longfellow
's
'
heart
for
any
fate
'
,
either
''
,
I
said
.
``
Moore
and
Longfellow
did
n't
have
the
fate
that
faces
us
''
,
Moreland
said
.
``
One
day
our
species
promises
co-existence
,
and
the
next
day
it
threatens
co_extinction
''
.
We
sat
for_a_while
drinking
in
silence
.
``
The
heart
''
,
I
said
finally
,
``
is
now
either
in
the
throat
or
the
mouth
or
the
stomach
or
the
shoes
.
When
it
was
worn
in
the
breast
,
or
even
on
the
sleeve
,
we
at_least
knew
where
it
was
''
.
There
was
a
long
silence
.
``
You
have
visited
England
five
times
in
the
past
quarter-century
,
I
believe
''
,
my
host
said
.
``
What
has
impressed
you
most
on
your
present
visit
''
?
``
I
would
say
depressed
,
not
impressed
''
,
I
told
him
.
``
I
should
say
it
is
the
turning
of
courts
of
law
into
veritable
theatres
for
sex
dramas
,
involving
clergymen
and
parishioners
,
psychiatrists
and
patients
.
It
is
becoming
harder
and
harder
to
tell
law
courts
and
political_arenas
from
the
modern
theatre
''
.
``
Do
you
think
we
need
a
new
Henry_James
to
re-explore
the
Anglo-American
scene
''
?
he
asked
.
``
Or
perhaps
a
new
Noel_Coward
''
?
``
But
you
must
have
heard
it
said
that
the
drawing-room
disappeared
forever
with
the
somnolent
years
of
James
and
the
antic
heyday
of
Coward
.
I
myself
hear
it
said
constantly
-
in
drawing-rooms
.
In
them
,
there
is
usually
a
group
of
Anglo-Americans
with
tragicomic
problems
,
worthy
of
being
explored
either
in
the
novel
or
in
the
play
or
in
comedy
and
satire
''
.
I
stood_up
and
began
pacing
.
``
If
you
are
trying
to
get
us
out
of
the
brothel
,
the
dustbin
,
the
kitchen_sink
,
and
the
tawdry
living-room
,
you
are
probably
wasting
your
time
''
,
Moreland
told
me
.
``
Too
many
of
our
writers
seem
to
be
interested
only
in
creatures
that
crawl
out
of
the
woodwork
or
from
under
the
rock
''
.
``
Furiouser
and
furiouser
''
,
I
said
.
``
I
am
worried
about
the
current
meanings
of
the
word
'
funny
'
.
It
now
means
ominous
,
as
when
one
speaks
of
a
funny
sound
in
the
motor
;
disturbing
,
as
when
one
says
that
a
friend
is
acting
funny
;
and
frightening
,
as
when
a
wife
tells
the
police
that
it
is
funny
,
but
her
husband
has
n't
been
home
for
two
days
and
nights
''
.
Moreland
sat
brooding
for
a
full
minute
,
during
which
I
made
each
of
us
a
new
drink
.
He
took
his
glass
,
clinked
it
against
mine
,
and
said
,
``
Toujours
gai
,
what_the_hell
''
!
borrowing
a
line
from
Don_Marquis
'
Mehitabel
.
``
Be
careful
of
the
word
'
gay
'
,
for
it
,
too
,
has
undergone
a
change
.
It
now
means
,
in
my
country
,
homosexual
''
,
I
said
.
``
Oh
,
I
forgot
to
say
that
if
one
is
taken
to
the
funny_house
in
the
funny_wagon
,
he
is
removed
to
a
mental_institution
in
an
ambulance
.
Recently
,
by_the_way
,
I
received
a
questionnaire
in
which
I
was
asked
whether
or
not
I
was
non
institutionalized
''
.
My
host
went_over
and
stared
out
the
window
at
his
peacocks
;
then
he
turned_to
me
.
``
Is
it
true
that
you
believe
the
other
animals
are
saner
than
the
human
species
''
?
``
Oh
,
that
is
demonstrable
''
,
I
told
him
.
``
Do
you
remember
the
woman
in
the
French_Alps
who
was
all
alone
with
her
sheep
one
day
when
the
sun
darkened
ominously
?
She
told
the
sheep
,
'
The
world
is
coming
to
an
end
'
!
And
the
sheep
said
-
all
in_unison
,
I
have
no_doubt
-
'
Ba-a-a
'
!
The
sound
mockery
of
sheep
is
like
the
salubrious
horse_laugh
''
.
``
That
is
only
partly
non
nonsense
''
,
he
began
.
``
If
you
saw
the
drama
called
Rhinoceros
''
,
I
said
,
``
think_of
the
effect
it
would
have
on
an
audience
of
rhinos
when
the
actor
on
stage
suddenly
begins
turning_into
a
rhinoceros
.
The
rhinos
would
panic
,
screaming
'
Help
'
!
-
if
that
can
be
screamed
in
their
language
''
.
``
You
think
the
Russians
are
getting_ahead
of
us
in
comedy
''
?
Moreland
demanded
.
``
Non-God
,
no
''
,
I
said
.
``
The
political
and
intellectual
Left
began
fighting
humor
and
comedy
years
ago
,
because
they
fear
things
they
do
not
understand
and
cannot
manage
,
such_as
satire
and
irony
,
such_as
humor
and
comedy
.
Nevertheless
,
like
any
other
human_being
upon
whom
the
spotlight
of
the
world
plays
continually
,
Khrushchev
,
the
anti
personality
cultist
,
has
become
a
comic
actor
,
or
thinks
he
has
.
In
his
famous
meeting
with
Nixon
a_couple_of
years
ago
he
seemed
to
believe
that
he
was
as
funny
as
Ed_Wynn
.
But
,
like
Caesar
,
he
has
only
one
joke
,
so_far_as
I
can
find_out
.
It
consists_in
saying
,
'
That
would
be
sending
the
goat
to
look_after
the
cabbage

.
Why
in
the
name_of_his_non-God
does
n't
he
vary
it
a_bit
''
?
``
Such_as
''
?
Moreland
asked
.
``
Such_as
'
sending
the
cat
to
guard
the
mice
'
,
or
'
the
falcon
to
protect
the
dove
'
,
or
most
terribly
sharp
of
all
,
'
the
human_being
to
save
humanity
''
'
.
``
You
and
I
have
fallen
out
of
literature
into
politics
''
,
Moreland
observed
.
``
What
a
nasty
fall
was
there
''
!
I
said
.
Moreland
went
over
to
stare
at
his
peacocks
again
,
and_then
came_back
and
sat_down
,
restively
.
``
The
world
that
was
once
foot-loose
and
fancy-free
''
,
he
said
,
``
has
now
become
screw-loose
and
frenzy
free
.
In
our
age
of
Science
and
Angst
it
seems
to
me
more
brave
to
stay
on
Earth
and
explore
inner
man
than
to
fly
far
from
the
sphere
of
our
sorrow
and
explore
outer_space
''
.
``
The
human
ego
being
what
it
is
''
,
I
put_in
,
``
science_fiction
has
always
assumed
that
the
creatures
on
the
planets
of
a_thousand
larger
solar_systems
than
ours
must
look_like
gigantic
tube-nosed_fruit_bats
.
It
seems
to
me
that
the
first
human_being
to
reach
one
of
these
planets
may
well
learn
what
it
is
to
be
a
truly
great
and
noble
species
''
.
``
Now
we
are
leaving
humor
and
comedy
behind
again
''
,
Moreland
protested
.
``
Not
in
the
largest
sense
of
the
words
''
,
I
said
.
``
The
other
day
Arnold_Toynbee
spoke
against
the
inveterate
tendency
of
our
species
to
believe_in
the
uniqueness
of
its
religions
,
its
ideologies
,
and
its
virtually
everything
else
.
Why
do
we
not
realize
that
no
ideology
believes
so
much
in
itself
as
it
disbelieves
in
something
else
?
Forty
years
ago
an
English
writer
,
W._L._George
,
dealt
with
this
subject
in
Eddies_of_the_Day
,
and
said
,
as
an
example
,
that
'
Saint_George
for
Merry_England
'
would
not
start
a
spirit
half
so
quickly
as
'
Strike
frog
eating
Frenchmen
dead
''
'
!
``
There
was
also
Gott_strafe_Angleterre
''
,
Moreland
reminded
me
,
``
and
Carthago_delenda_est
,
or
if
you
will
,
Deus_strafe_Carthage
.
It
is
n't
what
the
ideologist
believes_in
,
but
what
he
hates
,
that
puts
the
world
in
jeopardy
.
This
is
the
force
,
in
our
time
and
in
every
other
time
,
that
urges
the
paranoiac
and
the
manic-depressive
to
become
head
of
a
state
.
Complete
power
not_only
corrupts
but
it
also
attracts
the
mad
.
There
is
a
bitter
satire
for
a
future
writer
in
that
''
.
``
Great
satire
has
always
been
clearly
written
and
readily
understandable
''
,
I
said
.
``
But
we
now
find
writers
obsessed
by
the
nooks_and_crannies
of
their
ivory_towers
,
and
curiously
devoted
to
the
growing
obscurity
and
complexity
of
poetry
and
non
poetry
.
I
wrote
a_few
years
ago
that
one
of
the
cardinal
rules
of
writing
is
that
the
reader
should
be
able
to
get
some
idea
of
what
the
story
is
about
