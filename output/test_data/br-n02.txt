Gavin
paused
wearily
.
``
You
can
n't
stay
here
with
me
.
It
's
late
and
you
said
they
'd
be
here
by
dawn
''
.
``
You
can
n't
make
me
go
''
.
Gavin
sank
down
again
into
his
chair
and
began
to
rock
.
He
was
thinking_of
Rittenhouse
and_how
he
had
left
him
there
,
to
rock
to
death
on
the
porch
of
the
Splendide
.
It
was
the
only
thing
in
his
life
for
which
he
felt
guilt
.
Beneath
his
black
shirt
his
frail
shoulders
shook
and
croaks
of
pain
broke
from
his
throat
,
the
stored
pain
shattering
free
in
slow
gasps
,
terrible
to
see
.
Clayton
tried
to
call_back
the
face
of
the
man
he
had
known
.
Against
that
other
man
he
could
rally
his
anger
;
against
this
bent
man
in
the
chair
he
was
powerless
.
Gavin
's
lips
moved
so_that
Clayton
had
to
stoop
to
catch
the
words
.
``
Do
you
remember
Big_Charlie
''
?
he
whispered
.
``
He
stuck_with
me
all
these
years
.
Just
a
half-breed
'
pache
,
never
said
much
,
never
meant
anythin
to
me
,
but
he
stuck_with
me
.
He
got_into
a
fight
with
Tom_English
,
your
brother
's
son
.
It
was
a
fair
fight
,
the
boy
provoked
it
-
Big_Charlie
told
me
so
.
I
believed
him
.
They
killed
Big_Charlie
,
dumped
his
body
in
my
rose_garden
two
nights
ago
.
My
men
,
they
all
left
me
.
Just
cleared_out
.
I
did
n't
understand
why
,
Clay
.
They
just
all
cleared_out
.
I
treated
them
fair
''
.
He
wiped
his
lips
with
a
sleeve
,
then
stared
at
Clayton
in
a
childish
kind_of
wonder
.
``
Do
you
mean
''
-
he
asked
almost
shyly
-
``
you
want
me
to
go_with
you
,
wherever
you
're
goin
''
?
``
Yes
''
.
``
You
do
n't
hate
me
any_more
''
?
Clayton
choked
,
shook
his
head
,
murmuring
,
``
No
''
.
``
Come
here
''
.
The
old_man
beckoned
with
one
finger
and
Clayton
went_forward
to
him
.
Gavin
slipped
his
arms
around
his
chest
and
hugged
him
fiercely
.
``
All
my
life
''
,
he
said
,
``
I
tried
.
I
tried
.
I
saw
you
driftin
away
-
but
I
tried
.
And
you
wanted
no
part
of
me
when
I
had
so_much
to
give
.
Now
there
's
nothin
left
of
me
.
Laurel
is
gone
,
my
men
are
gone
,
Ed
is
dead
-
and
you
come
to
me
,
to
help
me
.
Oh
!
God
in
Heaven
,
I
can
n't
refuse
you
now
.
That
would
mock
me
too_much
!
Ca
n't
let
you
go
way
from
me
again
''
.
He
closed
his
eyes
,
ashamed
of
his
tears
.
``
I
'll
go
,
Clay
''
.
Clayton
freed
himself
from
the
embrace
and
stepped
back
.
The
eyes
followed
him
fearfully
.
``
The
horses
.
There
is
n't
much
time
.
I
'll
saddle
the
horses
and
bring
them
round
.
You
get
ready
''
.
He
burst
from
the
hot
confinement
of
the
room
into
the
cold
night
air
.
Gavin
's
stallion
was
in
the
barn
and
he
tightened
the
cinches
over
the
saddle_blanket
,
working
by_touch
in
the
darkness
,
comforting
the
animal
with
easy
words
.
When
he
had
finished
he
led
him
and
the
mare
to
the
porch
.
The
stallion
had
smelled
the
mare
coming
into
heat
and
began
to
paw
the
turf
,
shaking
his
head
.
Clayton
looped
the
reins
in
a
knot
over
the
veranda
post
and
patted
the
warm
flesh
of
his
neck
.
The
mare
had
backed_away
.
``
You
take_it_easy
,
boy
''
,
Clayton
whispered
.
``
She
does
n't
want
you
now
.
You
take_it_easy
,
your
time
will
come
''
.
Gavin
stood
on
the
porch
,
a
thin
figure
.
He
had
taken
a
carbine
down
from
the
wall
and
it
trailed
from
his
hand
,
the
stock
bumping
on
the
wood
floor
.
Clayton
called
to
him
and
he
came
slowly
down
the
steps
.
``
Clay
''
,
he
said
,
``
where
are
we
goin
''
?
``
To
a
ranch
in
the
valley
.
There
's
someone
there
I
have_to
see
.
We
may
take
her
with
us
-
to
California
.
I
do
n't
know
yet
,
it
's
crazy
;
I
have_to
think_about
it
.
But
California
is
where
we
're
goin
''
.
``
California
''
.
Gavin
began
to
nod
.
``
That
's
a
new
land
.
A
man
could
make
a
mark
there
.
two
men
,
together
like
us
,
we
could
do
somethin
fine
out
there
,
maybe
find
a
place
where
no
one
's
ever
been
.
Start_out
fresh
,
the
two
of
us
,
like
nothin
had
ever
happened
''
.
``
Yes
,
like
a
father
and
son
''
.
``
I
made
you
what
you
are
''
,
Gavin
whispered
.
``
I
made
you
so
you
could
stand_up
.
I
made
you
a
man
''
.
``
Yes
,
Gavin
,
you
did
''
.
He
approached
the
horse
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
stallion
's
quivering
neck
.
``
Help
me
up
,
Clay
.
Help
me
up
,
I
feel
kind_of
stiff
''
.
Clayton
lifted
him
gently
into
the
saddle
,
like
a
child
.
``
I
hate
to
leave
my
garden
''
,
Gavin
said
.
``
They
'll
trample
it
down
.
I
loved
my
garden
''
.
``
It
will
grow
again
-
in
California
''
.
``
I
loved
this
valley
''
,
he
whispered
huskily
.
``
Lived
alone
here
for
three
years
,
before
any
man
came
.
Lived
alone
by
the
river
.
It
was
nice
then
,
so
peaceful
and
quiet
.
There
was
no
one
but
me
.
I
do
n't
want
to
leave
it
''
.
Clayton
swung
into
the
saddle
and
whacked
the
stallion
's
rump
.
The
two
horses
broke
from
the
yard
,
from
the
circle
of
light
cast
by
the
lamp
still
burning
in
the
house
,
into
the
darkness
.
They
rode
at
a
measured
pace
through
the
valley
.
Dawn
would
come
soon
and
the
night
was
at
its
coldest
.
The
moon
had
sunk
below
the
black
crest
of
the
mountains
and
the
land
,
seen
through
eyes
that
had
grown
accustomed_to
the
absence
of
light
,
looked
primeval
,
as
if
no
man
had
ever
trespassed
before
.
It
looked
as
Gavin
had
first
seen
it
years
ago
,
on
those
nights
when
he
slept
alone
by
his
campfire
and
waked
suddenly
to
the
hoot
of
an
owl
or
the
rustle
of
a
blade
of
grass
in
the
moon
's
wind
-
a
savage
land
,
untenanted
and
brooding
,
too
strong
to
be
broken
by
the
will
of
men
.
Gavin
sighed
bitterly
.
In_that
inert
landscape
the
caravan
of
his
desires
passed
before
his
mind
.
He
saw
them
ambushed
,
strewn
in
the
postures
of
the
broken
and
the
dying
.
In_vain
his
mind
groped
to
reassemble
the
bones
of
the
relationships
he
had
sought
so
desperately
,
but
they
would
not
come_to_life
.
The
silence
oppressed
him
,
made
him
bend
low
over
the
horse
's
neck
as
if
to
hide
from
a
wind
that
had
begun
to
blow
far
away
and
was
twisting
slowly
through
the
darkness
in
its
slow
search
.
They
passed
ranches
that
were
framed
dark
gray
against
the
black
hills
.
Then
at_last
the
darkness
began
to
dissolve
.
A
bold
line
of
violet
broke_loose
from
the
high
ridge
of
the
mountains
,
followed
by
feathers
of
red
that
swept
the
last
stars
from
the
sky
.
The
wan
light
spread_over
the
ground
and
the
valley
revealed
in
the
first
glimmer
the
contours
of
trees
and
fences
and
palely
shadowed
gullies
.
They
had
been
seen
as
soon
as
they
left
the
ranch
,
picked_out
of
the
darkness
by
the
weary
though
watchful
eyes
of
two
men
posted
a_few
hundred
yards
away
in
the
windless
shelter
of
the
trees
.
The
two
men
whipped
their
horses
into
town
and
flung
themselves
up
the
steps
of
the
saloon
,
crying
their
intelligence
.
The
men
in
Pettigrew
's
were
tired
from
a
night
's
drinking
,
their
faces
red
and
baggy
.
But
the
liquor
had
flushed
their
courage
.
They
greeted
the
news
angrily
,
as
though
they
had
been
cheated
of
purpose
.
Lester
heard
their
muttering
,
saw
their
eyes
reveal
their
desire
.
He
worked
his
tongue
round
and
round
in
the
hollow
of
his
cheek
and
his
voice
came_out
of
his
throat
,
dry
and
cracked
.
``
He
's
leavin
.
That
's
what
you
wanted
,
is
n't
it
?
Clayton
is
with
him
,
takin
him
out
of
the
valley
.
You
can
n't
''
-
``
Keep_out
of_this
''
,
Purvis
snarled
.
``
He
's
not
your
brother
,
he
's
Gavin
's
son
.
You
see
,
he
lied
to
us
when
he
said
he
was
leavin
alone
''
.
Joe_Purvis
was
thinking_back
many
years
.
First
he
thought_of
the
time
he
had
ridden
to
Gavin
and
told
him
how
his
cattle
were
being
rustled
at
the
far
end
of
the
valley
.
He
remembered
Gavin
's
smirk
,
his
own
cringing
feeling
,
his
impotence
.
Then
he
thought_of
a
time
when
Clayton
's
horse
had
fallen
lame
in
the
Gap
.
His
wife
had
said
to
him
:
``
Nellie
is
in_love
with
Clayton_Roy
.
He
would
n't
even
dance
with
her
at
Gavin
's
party
.
He
treats
her
like
she
was
dirt
.
And
you
stand_by
like
a
fool
and
let
him
do
it
''
.
He
remembered
Clayton
's
mocking
smile
in
the
saloon
when
he
had
asked
him
what
he
would
do
if
they
brought
their
cattle
to
water
.
It
was
the
night
Clayton
had
tricked
them
in
the
poker_game
.
``
You
're
Gavin
's
son
''
,
Joe_Purvis
had
said
.
He
turned_to
Lester
.
``
You
brought
him
back
to
this
valley
thinkin
he
would
help
you
find
your
boy
.
He
meant
to
help
Gavin
all_the_time
.
He
made
a
fool
of
you
,
Lester
''
.
He
swung
round
to
the
other
men
-
``
We
can
catch
him
easy
!
There
are
plenty
of
fresh
horses
halfway
at
my
place
.
If
we
let
them
go
,
they
won
n't
stay
away
,
they
'll
find
men
to
ride
with
them
and
they
'll
be
back
.
There
's
only
one
way
they
can
get_out
now
and
that
's
through
the
Gap
-
if
we
ride
hard
we
can
take
them
''
.
Lester
's
hand
fluttered
to
Cabot
's
shoulder
.
The
boy
jerked
away
.
``
He
killed
Tom
-
do
you
understand
that
''
?
Cabot
turned
back
to
the
men
and
he
was
drunk
with
the
thing
they
would
do
,
wild
to
break
from
the
cloying
warmth
of
the
saloon
into
the
cold
of
the
ebbing
night
.
He
fled
through
the
door
and
down
the
steps
,
running
,
and
the
men
grunted
and
followed
,
pushing
Lester
to
one
side
where
he
backed
against
the
wall
with
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
raised
before
his
eyes
to
shut_out
the
light
.
Purvis
and
Silas_Pettigrew
were
the
last
to
leave
.
They
mounted_up
and
rode
slowly
behind
the
others
at
a
safe
distance
.
In
the
cold
dawn
the
mist
swirled
low
to
the
ground
,
then
rose
with
a
gust
of
sudden
wind
to
leave
the
valley
clear
.
The
clouds
parted
and
hard
gashes
of
sunlight
swooped
down
to
stain
the
earth
with
streaks
of
white
and
gold
light
so_that
the
shadows
of
the
running
horses
flowed
like
dark
streams
over
the
dazzling
snow
.
When
they
turned
in
the
saddle
they
could
see
the
men
behind
them
,
strung_out
on
the
prairie
in
a
flat
black
line
.
The
wind
of
their
running
was
cold
and
wild
,
the
horses
were
lathered
and
their
manes
streamed
like
stiff
black
pennants
in
the
wind
.
The
mare
began
to
tire
and
Clayton
felt
the
spray
of
snow
from
the
hoofs
of
Gavin
's
stallion
.
He
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
thin
dotting
of
pursuers
.
They
neither
gained
nor
fell_back
.
He
rode
low
on
the
mare
's
neck
.
Ahead
of
him
Gavin
turned
slightly
off
the
trail
and
pointed
for
the
Gap
,
no_more_than
a
mile
away
.
Gavin
's
face
was
bloodless
with_excitement
.
He
did
not
look_back
;
he
could
feel
more_than
hear
the
staccato
beat
of
hoofs
that
fanned_out
across
the
prairie
to_the_north
.
He
knew
who
was
riding
after
him
-
the
men
he
had
known
all
his
life
,
the
men
who
had
worked
for
him
,
sworn
their
loyalty
to
him
.
Now
they
were
riding
to
kill
him
.
And
he
was
fleeing
,
running
-
fleeing
his
death
and
his
life
at_the_same_time
.
The
land
over
which
he
sped
was
the
land
he
had
created
and
lived
in
:
his
valley
.
With
every
leaping
stride
of
the
horse
beneath
him
he
crossed
one
more
patch
of
earth
that
had
been
his
,
that
he
would
never
see
again
.
The
Gap
looming
before
him
-
the
place
where
had
confronted
Jack_English
on_that
day
so
many
years
ago
-
was
his
exit
from
all
that
had
meaning
to
him
.
California
is
too
far
,
he
thought
.
He
would
never
reach
California
.
He
was
too
old
-
when
he
passed
up
and
through
the
corridor
of
pines
that
lined
the
trail
he
could
see
ahead
,
he
was
passing
from
life
.
