Radio
is
easily
outdistancing
television
in
its
strides
to
reach
the
minority
listener
.
Lower
costs
and
a
larger
number
of
stations
are
the
key
factors
making
such
specialization
possible
.
The
mushrooming
of
FM
outlets
,
offering
concerts
(
both
jazz
and
classical
)
,
lectures
,
and
other
special
events
,
is
a
phenomenon
which
has
had
a
fair
amount
of
publicity
.
Not
so
well_known
is
the
growth
of
broadcasting
operations
aimed
wholly
or
partly
at
Negro
listeners
-
an
audience
which
,
in
the
United_States
,
comprises
some
19000000
people
with
$
20000000000
to
spend
each_year
.
Of_course
,
the
nonwhite
listener
does
his
share
of
television
watching
.
He
even
buys
a_lot_of
the
products
he
sees
advertised
-
despite_the_fact_that
the
copy
makes
no
special
bid
for
his
favor
and
sponsors
rarely
use
any
but
white
models
in
commercials
.
But
the
growing
number
of
Negro-appeal
radio_stations
,
plus
evidence
of
strong
listener
support
of
their
advertisers
,
give
time
salesmen
an
impressive
argument
as
they
approach
new
prospects
.
It
is
estimated
that
more_than
600
stations
(
of
a
total
of
3400
)
do
a
significant
amount
of
programing
for
the
Negro
.
At_least
60
stations
devote
all_of
their
time
to
reaching
this
audience
in
about
half
of
the
50
states
.
These
and
other
figures
and
comments
have
been
reported
in
a
special
supplement
of
Sponsor
magazine
,
a
trade
publication
for
radio
and
TV
advertisers
.
For
10
years
Sponsor
has
issued
an
annual
survey
of
the
size
and
characteristics
of
the
Negro
market
and
of
successful
techniques
for
reaching
this
market
through
radio
.
In_the_past
10
years
,
Sponsor
observes
,
these
trends
have
become
apparent
:
Negro
population
in
the
U._S.
has
increased
25
per_cent
while
the
white
population
was
growing
by
18
per_cent
.
``
The
forgotten
15
million
''
-
as
Sponsor
tagged
the
Negro
market
in
its
first
survey
-
has
become
a
better-remembered
19
million
.
Advertisers
are
changing
their
attitudes
,
both
as
to
the
significance
of_this
market
and
the
ways
of
speaking_to
it
.
Stations
programing
to
Negro
listeners
are
having
to
upgrade
their
shows
in_order_to
keep
pace
with
rising
educational
,
economic
,
and
cultural
levels
.
Futhermore
,
the
station
which
wants
real
prestige
must
lead
or
participate
in
community
improvement
projects
,
not
simply
serve
on
the
air
.
In
the
last
decade
the
number
of
Negro-appeal
radio
program
hours
has
risen
at_least
15
per_cent
,
and
the
number
of
Negro-appeal
stations
has
increased
30
per_cent
,
according
to
a
research
man
quoted
by
Sponsor
.
A
year
ago
the
Negro_Radio_Association
was
formed
to
spur
research
which
the
30
-
odd
member
stations
are
sure
will
bring_in
more
business
.
The
1960
census
underscored
the
explosive
character
of
the
population
growth
.
It
also
brought_home
proof
of
something
a
casual
observer
might
have
missed
:
that
more_than
half
of
the
U._S.
Negroes
live
outside
the
southeastern
states
.
Also
,
the
state
with
the
largest
number
of
Negroes
is
New_York
-
not
in
the
South
at_all
.
In
New_York_City
,
WLIB
boasts
``
more
community
service_programs
than
any
other
Negro
station
''
and
``
one
of
the
largest
Negro
news
staffs
in
America
''
.
And
WWRL
's
colorful
mobile
unit
,
cruising
predominately
Negro
neighborhoods
,
is
a
frequent
reminder
of_that
station
's
round-the-clock
dedication
to
nonwhite
interests
.
Recently
,
WWRL
won
praise
for
its
expose
of
particular
cases
of
employment_agency
deceit
.
A
half-dozen
other
stations
in
the
New_York
area
also
bid
for
attention
of
the
city
's
Negro
population
,
up
about
50
per_cent
in_the_past
decade
.
In_all
big
cities
outside
the
South
,
and
even
in
small_towns
within
the
South
,
radio_stations
can
be
found
beaming
some
or
all_of
their
programs
at
Negro
listeners
.
The
Keystone_Broadcasting_System
's
Negro
network
includes
360
affiliated
stations
,
whose
signals
reach
more_than
half
the
total
U._S._Negro
population
.
One
question
which
inevitably
crops_up
is
whether
such
stations
have
a
future
in
a
nation
where
the
Negro
is
moving_into
a
fully
integrated
status
.
Whatever
the
long-range
impact
of
integration
,
the
owners
of
Negro-appeal
radio_stations
these
days
know
they
have
an
audience
and
that
it
is
loyal
.
Advertisers
have
discovered
the
tendency
of
Negroes
to
shop
for
brand
names
they
have
heard
on
stations
catering
to
their
special
interests
.
And
many
advertisers
have
been
happy
with
the
results
of
letting
a
Negro
disc_jockey
phrase
the
commercial
in
his
own
words
,
working
only
from
a
fact
sheet
.
What
sets
Negro-appeal
programing
apart
from
other
radio
shows
?
Sponsor
magazine
notes
the
stress
on
popular
Negro
bands
and
singers
;
rhythm-and-blues
mood
music
;
``
race
''
music
,
folk_songs
and
melodies
,
and
gospel
programs
.
Furthermore
,
news
and
special
presentations
inform
the
listener
about
groups
,
projects
,
and
personalities
rarely
mentioned
on
a
general-appeal
station
.
Advertising
copy
frequently
takes_into_account
matters
of
special
Negro
concern
.
Sponsor
quotes
John_McLendon
of
the
McLendon-Ebony
station
group
as
saying
that
the
Southern_Negro
is
becoming
conscious_of
quality
and
and
``
does
not
wish
to
be
associated
with
radio
which
is
any
way
degrading
to
his
race
;
he
tends
to
shy_away_from
the
hooting
and
hollering
personalities
that
originally
made
Negro
radio
programs
famous
''
.
The
sociological
impact
is
perhaps
most
eloquently
summed_up
in_this
quotation
of
J._Walter_Carroll
of
KSAN
,
San_Francisco
:
``
Negro-appeal
radio
is
more
important
to
the
Negro
today
,
because
it
provides
a
direct
and
powerful
mirror
in_which
the
Negro
can
hear
and
see
his
ambitions
,
achievements
and
desires
.
It
will
continue
to
be
important
as
a
means
of
orientation
to
the
Negro
,
seeking
to
become
urbanized
,
as
he
tries
to
make
adjustment
to
the
urban
life
.
Negro
radio
is
vitally
necessary
during
the
process
of
assimilation
''
.
Presentation
of
``
The
Life
and
Times
of
John_Sloan
''
in
the
Delaware_Art_Center
here
suggests
a
current
nostalgia
for
human
values
in
art
.
Staged
by
way
of
announcing
the
gift
of
a
large
and
intimate
Sloan
collection
by
the
artist
's
widow
,
Helen_Farr_Sloan
,
to
the
Wilmington_Society
of
the
Fine_Arts
,
the
exhibition
presents
a
survey
of
Sloan
's
work
.
From
early
family
portraits
,
painted
before
he
entered
the
schools
of
the
Pennsylvania_Academy
of
the
Fine_Arts
,
the
chronology
extends_to
a
group
of
paintings
executed
in
his
last
year
(
1951
)
and
still
part
of
his
estate
.
Few
artists
have
left
a
life
work
so
eloquent
of
the
period
in_which
they
lived
.
Few
who
have
painted
the
scenes
around
them
have
done
so
with
so
little
bitterness
.
The
paintings
,
drawings
,
prints
,
and
illustrations
all
reflect
the
manners
,
costumes
,
and
mores
of
America
in
the
first_half
of
the
present
century
.
Obviously
Sloan
's
early
years
were
influenced
by
his
close
friend
Robert_Henri
.
As
early
as
1928
,
however
,
the
Sloan
style
began
to
change
.
The
dark
pigments
of
the
early
work
were
superseded
by
a
brighter
palette
.
The
solidity
of
brush
stroke
yielded
to
a
hatching
technique
that
finally
led
to
virtual
abandonment
of
American
genres
in
favor
of
single
figure
studies
and
studio
nudes
.
The
exhibition
presents
all
phases
of
Sloan
's
many-sided
art
.
In_addition
to
the
paintings
are
drawings
,
prints
,
and
illustrations
.
Sloan
created
such
works
for
newspaper
supplements
before
syndication
threw
him
out
of
a
job
and
sent
him
to
roam
the
streets
of
New_York
,
thereby
building
for
America
an
incomparable
city
survey
from
paintings
of
McSorley
's
Saloon
to
breezy
clotheslines
on
city
roofs
.
One
of
the_most
appealing
of
the
rooftop
canvases
is
``
Sun
and
Wind
on
the
Roof
''
,
with
a
woman
and
child
bracing
themselves
against
flapping
clothes
and
flying
birds
.
Although
there
are
landscapes
in
the
show
(
one
of
the
strongest
is
a
vista
of
``
Gloucester_Harbor
''
in
1915
)
,
the
human
element
was
the
compelling
factor
in
Sloan
's
art
.
Significant
are
such
canvases
as
``
Bleeker_Street
,
Saturday_Night
''
,
with
its
typically
American
crowd
(
Sloan
never
went
abroad
)
;
the
multifigure
``
Traveling_Carnival
''
,
in_which
action
is
vivified
by
lighting
;
or
``
Carmine_Theater
,
1912
''
,
the
only
canvas
with
an
ash
can
(
and
foraging
dog
)
,
although
Sloan
was
a
member
of
the
famous
``
Eight
''
,
and
of
the
so-called
``
Ash-Can_School
''
,
a
term
he
resented
.
Not
all
the
paintings
,
however
,
are
of
cities
.
The
exhibition
touches
briefly
on
his
sojourn
in
the
Southwest
(
``
Koshare
in
the
Dust
''
,
a
vigorous
Indian
dance
,
and
landscapes
suggest
the
influence
of
western
color
on
his
palette
)
.
The
fact
that
Sloan
was
an
extrovert
,
concerned
primarily
with
what
he
saw
,
adds
greatly
to
the
value
of
his
art
as
a
human
chronicle
.
There
are
151
items
in
the
Wilmington
show
,
including
one
painting
by
each
member
of
the
``
Eight
''
,
as_well
as
work
by
Sloan
's
friends
and
students
.
Supplementing
the
actual
art
are
memorabilia
-
correspondence
,
diaries
,
books
from
the
artist
's
library
,
etc.
.
All
belong_to
the
collection
being
given
to
Wilmington
over
a
period
of
years
by
Mrs._Sloan
,
who
has
cherished
such
revelatory
items
ever
since
she
first
studied
with
Sloan
at
the
Art_Students
League
,
New_York
,
in
the
1920
's
.
To
enable
students
and
the
public
to
spot
Sloan
forgeries
,
the
Delaware_Art_Center
(
according
to
its
director
,
Bruce_St._John
)
will
maintain
a
complete
file
of
photographs
of
all
Sloan
works
,
as_well
as
a
card
index
file
.
The
entire
Sloan
collection
will
be
made
available
at
the
center
to
all
serious
art_students
and
historians
.
The
current
exhibition
,
which
remains
on
view
through
Oct.
29
,
has
tapped
14
major
collections
and
many
private
sources
.
Any
musician
playing
Beethoven
here
,
where
Beethoven
was_born
,
is
likely
to
examine
his
own
interpretations
with
special
care
.
In_a_sense
,
he
is
offering
Bonn
what
its
famous
son
(
who
left
as
a
youth
)
never
did
-
the
sound
of
the
composer
's
mature
style
.
Robert_Riefling
,
who
gave
the
only
piano
recital
of
the
recently
concluded
23
rd
Beethoven_Festival
,
penetrated
deep
into
the
spirit
of
the
style
.
His
readings
were
careful
without
being
fussy
,
and
they
were
authoritative
without
being
presumptuous
.
The
32
C
minor
Variations
with
which
he
opened
moved
fluently
yet
logically
from
one
to
another
,
leaving
the
right
impression
of
abundance
under
discipline
.
The
D
minor
Sonata
,
Op.
31
No.
2
,
introduced
by
dynamically
shaped
arpeggios
,
was
most
engaging
in
its
moments
of
quasi-recitative
-
single
lines
in_which
the
fingers
seemed
to
be
feeling
their
way
toward
the
idea
to
come
.
These
inwardly
dramatic
moments
showed
the
kind_of
``
opera
style
''
of_which
Beethoven
was
genuinely
capable
,
but
which
did
not
take
so
kindly
to
the
mechanics
of
staging
.
Two
late
Sonatas
,
Op.
110
and
111
,
were
played
with
similar
insight
,
the
disarming
simplicities
of
the
Op.
111
Adagio
made
plain
without
ever
becoming
obvious
.
The
two
were
separated
from
each
other
by
the
Six
Bagatelles
of
Op.
126
.
Herr_Riefling
,
in
everything
he
gave
his
large
Beethoven_Hall
audience
,
proved
himself
as
an
interpreter
of
unobtrusive
authority
.
Volker_Wangenheim
,
who
conducted
Bonn
's
Sta
^
dtisches
Orchester
on
the
following
evening
,
made
one
more
conscious_of
the
process
of
interpretation
.
Herr_Wangenheim
has
only
recently
become
the
city
's
music_director
,
and
is
a
young_man
with
a
clear
flair
for
the
podium
.
But
he
weighted
the
Eighth_Symphony
,
at_times
,
with
a
shuddering
subjectivity
which
seemed
considerably
at_odds
with
the
music
.
He
might
have
been
hoping
,
to
all
appearances
,
that
this
relatively
sunny
symphony
,
in
conjunction
with
the
Choral_Fantasy
at
the
end
of
the
program
,
could
amount
to
something
like
the
Ninth
;
but
no
amount
of
head-tossing
could
make
it
so
.
The
conductor
's
preoccupation
with
the
business
of
starting
and
stopping
caused
occasional
raggedness
,
as
with
the
first
orchestra
entrance
in
the
Fourth_Piano_Concerto
,
but
when
he
put
his
deliberations
and
obsequies
aside
and
let
the
music
move
as
designed
,
it
did
so
with
plenty
of
spring
.
The
concerto
's
soloist
,
Hans_Richter-Haaser
,
played
with
compensatory
ease
and
economy
,
though
without
the
consummate
plasticity
to_which
we
had
been
treated
on
the
previous
evening
by
Herr_Riefling
.
His
was
a
burgomaster
's
Beethoven
,
solid
and
sensible
.
Everybody
returned
after
intermission
for
the
miscellaneous
sweepings
of
the
Fantasy
for
Piano
,
Chorus
,
and
Orchestra
in
C
minor
,
made_up
by
its
composer
to
fill_out
one
of
his
programs
.
The
entrance
of
the
Sta
^
dtisches
Gesangverein
(
Bonn
's
civic
chorus
)
was
worth
all
the
waiting
,
however
,
as
the
young
Rhenish
voices
finally
brought
the
music
to
life
.
The
last
program
of_this
festival
,
which
during
two_weeks
had
sampled
most
compositional
categories
,
brought
the
Cologne_Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchester
and
Rundfunkchor
to
Bonn
's
gold-filled
hall
for
a
performance
of
the
Missa_Solemnis
.
