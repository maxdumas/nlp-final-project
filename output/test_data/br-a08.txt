as
promotion
manager
of
The
Times-Picayune
Publishing_Company
was
announced
Saturday
by
John_F._Tims
,
president
of
the
company
.
Pfaff
succeeds
Martin_Burke
,
who
resigned
.
The
new
promotion
manager
has
been
employed
by
the
company
since
January
,
1946
,
as
a
commercial_artist
in
the
advertising_department
.
He
is
a
native
of
New_Orleans
and
attended
Allen
Elementary_school
,
Fortier
High_school
and
Soule
business_college
.
From
June
,
1942
,
until
December
,
1945
,
Pfaff
served
in
the
Army
Air_Corps
.
While
in
the
service
he
attended
radio
school
at
Scott_Field
in
Belleville
,
Ill.
.
Before
entering
the
service
,
Pfaff
for
five
years
did
clerical
work
with
a
general
merchandising
and
wholesale
firm
in
New_Orleans
.
He
is
married
to
the
former
Audrey_Knecht
and
has
a
daughter
,
Karol
,

.
They
reside
at

Miles_dr.
.
Thousands
of
bleacher-type
seats
are
being
erected
along
Pennsylvania_Avenue
between
the
Capitol
and
the
White_House
for
the
big
inaugural
parade
on
Jan.
20
.
Assuming
the
weather
is
halfway
decent
that
day
,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
persons
will
mass
along
this
thoroughfare
as
President_John_F._Kennedy
and
retiring
President_Dwight_D._Eisenhower
leave
Capitol_Hill
following
the
oath-taking
ceremonies
and
ride
down
this
historic
ceremonial
route
.
Pennsylvania_Avenue
,
named
for
one
of
the
original
13
states
,
perhaps
is
not
the_most
impressive
street
in
the
District_of_Columbia
from
a
commercial
standpoint
.
But
from
a
historic
viewpoint
none
can
approach
it
.
Within
view
of
the
avenue
are
some
of
the
United_States_government
's
tremendous
buildings
,
plus
shrines
and
monuments
.
Of_course
,
1600
Pennsylvania
,
the
White_House
,
is
the_most
famous
address
of
the
free_world
.
Within
an
easy
walk
from
Capitol_Hill
where
Pennsylvania_Avenue
comes
together
with
Constitution_Avenue
,
begins
a
series
of
great
federal
buildings
,
some
a
block
long
and
all
about
seven-stories
high
.
Great
chapters
of
history
have
been
recorded
along
the
avenue
,
now
about
169
years
old
.
In
the
early
spring
of
1913
a_few
hundred_thousand
persons
turned_out
to
watch
5000
women
parade
.
They
were
the
suffragettes
and
they
wanted
to
vote
.
In
the
1920
presidential
election
they
had
that
right
and
many_of
them
did
vote
for_the_first_time
.
Along
this
avenue
which
saw
marching
soldiers
from
the
War_Between_the_States
returning
in
1865
is
the
National
Archives
building
where
hundreds
of
thousands
of_this
country
's
most
valuable
records
are
kept
.
Also
the
department_of_justice
building
is
located
where
J._Edgar_Hoover
presides
over
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
.
Street
car
tracks
run
down
the
center
of
Pennsylvania
,
powered
with
lines
that
are
underground
.
Many
spectators
will
be
occupying
seats
and
vantage_points
bordering
Lafayette_Square
,
opposite
the
White_House
.
In_this
historic
square
are
several
statutes
,
but
the
one
that
stands_out
over
the
others
is
that
of
Gen._Andrew_Jackson
,
hero
of
the
Battle
of
New_Orleans
.
Moving
past
the
presidential
viewing
stand
and
Lafayette_Square
will
be
at_least
40
marching
units
.
About
16000
military
members
of
all
branches
of
the
armed_forces
will
take_part
in
the
parade
.
Division
one
of
the
parade
will
be
the
service
academies
.
Division
two
will
include
the
representations
of
Massachusetts
and
Texas
,
the
respective
states
of
the
President
and
of
Vice-President_L._B._Johnson
.
Then
will
come
nine
other
states
in
the
order
of
their
admission
to
the
union
.
Division
three
will
be
headed
by
the
Marines
followed
by
12
states
;
division
four
will
be
headed
by
the
Navy
,
followed
by
11
states
;
division
five
,
by
the
Air_Force
followed
by
11
states
.
Division
six
will
be
headed
by
the
Coast_Guard
,
followed
by
the
reserve
forces
of
all
services
,
five
states
,
Puerto_Rico
,
the_Virgin
Islands
,

What
does
1961
offer
in
political
and
governmental
developments
in
Mississippi
?
Even
for
those
who
have
been
observing
the
political
scene
a
long_time
,
no
script
from
the
past
is
worth
very_much
in
gazing
into
the
state
's
immediate
political
future
.
This
is
largely
because
of
the
unpredictability
of
the
man
who
operates
the
helm
of
the
state_government
and
is
the
elected
leader
of
its
two
million
inhabitants
-
Gov._Ross_Barnett
.
Barnett
,
who
came
into
office
with
no
previous
experience
in_public
administration
,
has
surrounded
himself
with
confusion
which
not_only
keeps
his
foes
guessing
but
his
friends
as_well
.
Consequently
,
it
is
uncertain
after
nearly
12
months
in
office
just
which
direction
the
Barnett
administration
will
take
in
the
coming
year
.
Some
predict
the
administration
will
settle_down
during
1961
and
iron_out
the
rough
edges
which
it
has
had
thus_far
.
The
builtin
headache
of
the
Barnett
regime
thus_far
has
been
the
steady
stream
of
job-seekers
and_others
who
feel
they
were
given
commitments
by
Barnett
at
some
stage
of
his
eight-year
quest
for
the
governor
's
office
.
There
are
many
who
predict
that
should
Barnett
decide
to
call
the
Legislature
back
into
special
session
,
it
will
really
throw
his
administration
into
a
scramble
.
Certainly
nobody
will
predict
that
the
next
time
the
lawmakers
come_back
together
Barnett
will
be_able_to
enjoy
a
re-enactment
of
the
strange
but
successful
``
honeymoon
''
he
had
in
the
1960
legislative
session
.
If
Barnett
does
n't
call
a
special
session
in
1961
,
it
will
be
the
first
year
in
the
last
decade
that
the
Legislature
has
not
met
in
regular
or
special
session
.
The
odds
favor
a
special
session
,
more_than
likely
early
in
the
year
.
Legislators
always
get
restless
for
a
special
session
(
whether
for
the
companionship
or
the
$
22.50
per_diem
is
not
certain
)
and
if
they
start
agitating
.
Barnett
is
not
expected
to
be
able
to
withstand
the
pressure
.
The
issue
which
may
make
it
necessary
to
have
a
session
is
the
highly_sensitive
problem
of
cutting
the
state
's
congressional_districts
from
six
to
five
to
eliminate
one
congressional
seat
.
With
eyes
focused_on
the
third
congressional_district
,
the
historic
Delta
district
,
and
Congressman_Frank_E._Smith
as
the
one
most
likely
to
go
,
the
redistricting
battle
will
put
to
a
test
the
longstanding
power
which
lawmakers
from
the
Delta
have
held
in
the
Legislature
.
Mississippi
's
relations
with
the
national
Democratic_party
will
be
at
a
crossroads
during
1961
,
with
the
first
Democratic
president
in
eight
years
in
the
White_House
.
Split
badly
during
the
recent
presidential
election
into
almost
equally
divided
camps
of
party
loyalists
and
independents
,
the
Democratic_party
in
Mississippi
is
currently
a
wreck
.
And
there
has
been
no
effort
since
the
election
to
pull
it
back
together
.
Barnett
,
as
the
titular
head
of
the
Democratic_party
,
apparently
must
make
the
move
to
reestablish
relations
with
the
national
Democratic_party
or
see
a
movement
come
from
the
loyalist
ranks
to
completely
bypass
him
as
a
party
functionary
.
With
a
Democratic
administration
,
party
patronage
would
normally
begin
to
flow
to
Mississippi
if
it
had
held
its
Democratic
solidarity
in
the
November
election
.
Now
,
the
picture
is
clouded
,
and
even
US
Sens._James_O._Eastland
and
John_C._Stennis
,
who
remained
loyal
to
the
ticket
,
are
uncertain
of
their
status
.
Reports
are
that
it
is
more_than
probability
that
the
four
congressmen
from
Mississippi
who
did
not
support
the
party
ticket
will
be
stripped
of
the
usual
patronage
which
flows
to
congressmen
.
The
Gov._Jimmie_H._Davis
administration
appears
to
face
a
difficult
year
in
1961
,
with
the
governor
's
theme
of
peace
and
harmony
subjected
to
severe
stresses
.
The
year
will
probably
start_out
with
segregation
still
the_most
troublesome
issue
.
But
it
might
give_way
shortly
to
another
vexing
issue
-
that
of
finances
in
state_government
.
The
transition
from
segregation
to
finances
might
already
be
in_progress
,
in
the
form
of
an
administration
proposal
to
hike
the
state
sales_tax
from
2
per_cent
to
3
per_cent
.
The
administration
has
said
the
sales_tax
proposal
is
merely
part
of
the
segregation
strategy
,
since
the
revenues
from
the
increase
would
be
dedicated
to
a
grant
in
aid
program
.
But
the
tardiness
of
the
administration
in
making
the
dedication
has
caused
legislators
to
suspect
the
tax_bill
was
related
more
directly
to
an
over-all
shortage
of
cash
than
to
segregation
.
Indeed
,
the
administration
's
curious
position
on
the
sales_tax
was
a
major
factor
in
contributing
to
its
defeat
.
The
administration
could
not
say
why
$
28
million
was
needed
for
a
grant-in-aid
program
.
The
effectiveness
of
the
governor
in
clearing_up
some
of
the
inconsistencies
revolving_about
the
sales_tax
bill
may
play
a
part
in
determining
whether
it
can
muster
the
required
two-thirds
vote
.
The
tax_bill
will
be
up
for
reconsideration
Wednesday
in
the
House
when
the
Legislature
reconvenes
.
Davis
may
use
the
tax_bill
as
a
means
to
effect
a
transition
from
special
sessions
of
the
Legislature
to
normalcy
.
If
it
fails
to
pass
,
he
can
throw
up
his
hands
and
say
the
Legislature
would
not
support
him
in
his
efforts
to
prevent
integration
.
He
could
terminate
special
sessions
of
the
Legislature
.
Actually
,
Davis
would
have
to
toss_in_the_towel
soon
anyway
.
Many
legislators
are
already
weary
and
frustrated
over
the
so-far
losing
battle
to
block
token
integration
.
This
is
not
the
sort_of
thing
most
politicos
would
care
to
acknowledge
publicly
.
They
would
like
to
convey
the
notion
something
is
being
done
,
even_though
it
is
something
they
know
to
be
ineffectual
.
Passage
of
the
sales_tax
measure
would
also
give
Davis
the
means
to
effect
a
transition
.
He
could
tell
the
Legislature
they
had
provided
the
needed
funds
to
carry_on
the
battle
.
Then
he
could
tell
them
to
go_home
,
while
the
administration
continued
to
wage
the
battle
with
the
$
28
million
in
extra
revenues
the
sales_tax
measure
would
bring_in
over
an
eight
months
period
.
It
is
difficult
to
be
certain
how
the
administration
views
that
$
28
million
,
since
the
views
of
one
leader
may
not
be
the
same
as
the
views
of
another
one
.
But
if
the
administration
should
find
it
does
not
need
the
$
28
million
for
a
grant-in-aid
program
,
a
not
unlikely
conclusion
,
it
could
very_well
seek
a
way
to
use
the
money
for
other
purposes
.
This
would
be
in
perfect
consonance
with
the
underlying
concern
in
the
administration
-
the
shortage
of
cash
.
It
could
become
an
acute
problem
in
the
coming
fiscal_year
.
If
the
administration
does
not
succeed
in
passing
the
sales_tax
bill
,
or
any
other
tax_bill
,
it
could
very_well
be
faced
this
spring
at
the
fiscal
session
of
the
Legislature
with
an
interesting
dilemma
.
Since
the
constitution
forbids
introduction
of
a
tax_bill
at
a
fiscal
session
,
the
administration
will
either
have
to
cut_down
expenses
or
inflate
its
estimates
of
anticipated
revenues
.
In
either
case
,
it
could
call
a
special
session
of
the
Legislature
later
in
1961
to
make
another
stab
at
raising
additional
revenues
through
a
tax
raiser
.
The
prospect
of
cutting_back
spending
is
an
unpleasant
one
for
any
governor
.
It
is
one
that
most
try
to
avoid
,
as
long
as
they
can
see
an
alternative
approach
to
the
problem
.
But
if
all
alternatives
should
be
clearly
blocked_off
,
it
can
be
expected
the
Davis
administration
will
take
steps
to
trim
spending
at
the
spring
session
of
the
state
Legislature
.
This
might
be
done
to
arouse
those
who
have
been
squeezed_out
by
the
trims
to
exert
pressure
on
the
Legislature
,
so
it
would
be
more
receptive
to
a
tax
proposal
later
in
the
year
.
A
constant
problem
confronting
Davis
on
any
proposals
for
new
taxes
will
be
the
charge
by
his
foes
that
he
has
not
tried
to
economize
.
Any
tax_bill
also
will
revive
allegations
that
some
of
his
followers
have
been
using
their
administration
affiliations
imprudently
to
profit
themselves
.
The
new_year
might
see
some
house-cleaning
,
either
genuine
or
token
,
depending_upon
developments
,
to
give
Davis
an
opportunity
to
combat
some
of
these
criticisms
.
