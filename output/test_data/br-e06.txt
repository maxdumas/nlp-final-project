At_one_time
,
to
most
Americans
,
unless
they
were
fortunate
enough
to
live
near
a
body
of
navigable
water
,
boats
were
considered
the
sole
concern
of
fishermen
,
rich
people
,
and
the
United_States
Navy
.
Today
the
recreational
boating
scene
is
awash
with
heartening
statistics
which
prove
the
enormous
growth
of_that
sport
.
There
are
more_than
8000000
recreational
boats
in_use
in
the
United_States
with
almost
10000000
the
prediction
for
within
the
next
decade
.
About
40000000
people
participated
in
boating
in
1960
.
Boating
has
become
a
giant
whose
strides
cover
the
entire
nation
from
sea
to
shining
sea
.
Boats
are
operated
in
every
state
in
the
Union
,
with
the
heaviest
concentrations
along
both
coasts
and
in_the_Middle
West
.
The
spectacular
upsurge
in
pleasure
boating
is
markedly
evident
,
expectedly
,
in
the
areas
where
boats
have
always
been
found
:
the
natural
lakes
,
rivers
,
and
along
the
nation
's
coastline
.
But
during
the
last
several
years
boats
were
launched
in
areas
where
,
a
short_time
ago
,
the
only
water
to
be
found
was
in
wells
and
watering
troughs
for
livestock
.
Developed
as
a
result
of
the
multi-purpose
resources
control
program
of
the
government
,
vast
,
man-made
bodies_of_water
represent
a
kind_of
glorious
fringe_benefit
,
providing
boating
and
fishing
havens
all_over
the
country
.
No_matter_how
determined
or
wealthy
boating
lovers
of
the
Southwest
had
been
,
for_example
,
they
could
never
have
created
anything
approaching
the
fifty
square-mile
Lake_Texoma
,
located
between
Texas
and
Oklahoma
,
which
resulted
when
the
Corp
of
Army_Engineers
dammed
the
Red_River
.
In
1959
,
according
to
the
Engineers
,
Lake_Texoma
was
only
one
of
thirty-two
artificial_lakes
and
reservoirs
which
were
used
for
recreation
by
over
1000000
persons
.
Where
an
opportunity
to
enjoy
boating
has
not
been
created
by
bringing
bodies_of_water
to
the
people
,
means
have
been
found
to
take
the
people
and
their
boats
to
the
water
.
Providing
these
means
are_about
ninety
companies
which
manufactured
the
estimated
1800000
boat
trailers
now
in_use
.
It
is
a
simple
task
to
haul
a
boat
fifty
or
one_hundred
miles
to
a
lake
or
reservoir
on
the
new
,
light
,
strong
,
easy-to-operate
trailers
which
are_built
to
accommodate
almost
any
kind_of
small_boat
and
retail
from
$
100
to
$
2000
.
The
sight
of
sleek
inboards
,
outboards
,
and
sailboats
being
wheeled
smartly
along
highways
many
miles
from
any
water
is
commonplace
.
Boatmen
lucky
enough
to
have
facilities
for
year
'
round
anchorage
for
their
craft
,
will
recall
the
tedious
procedure
of
loading
their
gear
into
the
car
,
driving
to
the
water
,
and
making
trip
after
trip
to
transfer
the
gear
to
the
boat
.
Today
,
the
boat
,
on
its
trailer
,
is
brought
to
the
gear
and
loaded
at
the
door
.
Arriving_at
the
waterside
,
the
boat
is
launched
,
the
family
taken
aboard
and
,
that
easily
,
another
day
afloat
is
begun
.
And
trailers
for
boats
are
not
what
they
started_out
to
be
ten
years
ago
.
This
year
,
Americans
will
discover
previously
unheard
of
refinements
in
trailers
that
will
be
exhibited
in
about
one_hundred
of
our
nation
's
national
,
regional
and
local
boat
shows
.
The
boats
of
America
's
trailer
sailors
in
1961
will
be
coddled
on
clouds
as
they
are
hauled
to
new
horizons
.
The
variety
of
craft
on
the
country
's
waters
today
is
overwhelming
.
They
range
from
an
eight-foot
pram
,
which
you
can
build
yourself
for
less_than
$
50
,
to
auxiliary
sailboats
which
can
cost
over
$
100000
.
Boat
prices
vary
according
to
the
buyer
's
desires
or
needs
.
In_this
respect
,
boats
can
be
compared
with
houses
.
There
is
no
limit
to
what
you
can
spend
,
yet
it
is
easily
possible
to
keep
within
a
set
budget
.
There
is
no
question
as
to
just
what
is
available
.
You
name
it
,
our
industry
is
producing
it
,
and
it
probably
is
made
in
different
models
.
There
are
canoes
ideal
for
fishing
in
protected
waters
or
for
camping
trips
.
There
are
houseboats
which
are
literally
homes
afloat
,
accommodating
whole
families
in
comfort
and
convenience
.
You
can
cross
an
ocean
in
a
fully
equipped
craft
,
sail
,
power
,
or
both
,
or
laze
away
a
fine
day
in
a
small
dinghy
on
a
local
pond
.
You
may
have
your
boat
of
wood
,
canvas
,
plywood
,
plastic
,
or
metal
.
You
may
order
utility
models
,
inboard
or
outboard
,
with
or
without
toilets
,
galleys
,
and
bunks
.
You
may
dress
it
up
with
any
number
of
accessories
or
keep
it
as
simple
as
you
choose
.
Designers
and
manufacturers
have
produced
models
for
purchasers
who
run
the
gamut
from
a
nautical
version
of
the
elderly
Pasadena
lady
who
never
drove
more_than
five
miles
an
hour
on
her
once-a-month
ride
around
the
block
,
to
the
sportiest
boatman
who
insists
on
all
the
dash
,
color
,
flair
and
speed
possible
to
encompass
in
a
single
boat
.
You
pay
your
money
and
you
take
your
choice
.
American
technology
in
engine
and
hull
design
is
largely
responsible_for
the
plentiful
interest
in
American
boating
.
I
wonder
if
anyone
ever
bothered
to
make
the
point
that
when
it
comes_to
boats
and
their
motors
,
Americans
excel
over
any
country
in
the
world
in_the_long_run
.
Russia
,
whose
technology
is
not_quite
primitive
,
is
still
in
the
dark_ages
when
it
comes_to
improving
the
outboard_motor
,
for_instance
.
Now
here
is
truly
a
marvel
.
The
outboard
engine
of
today
has
a
phenomenal
range
of
one
to
80
horsepower
,
unheard
of
a_few
years
ago
for
a
two
cycle
engine
in
quantity
production
.
These
engines
can
be
removed
from
a
boat
with
relative
ease
,
wherein
lies
their
greatest
advantage
.
Their
cost
is
not
beyond
the
hopes
of
the
American
pocketbook
,
the
range
being
about
$
150
to
$
1000
,
depending_on
size
.
Great
thought
has
been
given
to
making
life
easier
for
the
growing
boating
population
of
the
country
;
and
to
making
the
owning
of
a
boat
simpler
.
There
was
a
time
when
,
if
a
man
wanted
to
purchase
a
boat
,
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
be
able
to
produce
a
sizeable
amount
of
cash
before
he
could
touch
the
tiller
or
wheel
.
Having
a
boat
financed
through
a
local
bank
is
done
much
the
same
way
as
an
automobile
loan
is
extended
.
Marine
dealers
and
even
some
manufacturers
who
sell
direct
in
non-dealer
areas
cooperate
in
enabling
you
to
launch
now
and
pay
later
.
Terms
range
from
one
to
five
years
and
the
interest_rates
and
down_payments
run
about
the
same
as
for
automobiles
.
Of_course
,
individual
financing
arrangements
depend
a
good_deal
on
the
purchaser
's
earning
power
,
credit
rating
and
local
bank
policy
.
Outboard_motors
,
insurance
,
and
boat
repairs
may
also
be
financed
in
the
same
way
as
boats
.
Terms
and
rates
of
interest
for
motors
generally
follow
those
for
home_appliances
.
When
the
automobile
was
in
its
embryonic
stage
,
such
roads
as
existed
were
pretty_much
open
roads
with
the
tacit
understanding
that
horses
should
not
be
unduly
terrified
being
about
the
only
rule
governing
where
,
when
and_how
fast
a
car
could
go
.
When
air_travel
was
in
its
infancy
,
the
sky
was
considered
big
enough
and
high
enough
for
all
.
Man
had
enough
to
worry
about
managing
to
get
up
there
and
stay
without
being
burdened
with
rules
once
aloft
.
It
was
much
the
same
with
pleasure
boating
at_first
.
Come
one
,
come
all
,
the
water
's
fine
!
As
the
ungoverned
days
of
the
automobile
and
the
airplane
are
long_since
relegated
to
the
past
,
so
is
the
carefree
attitude
toward
what
a
boatman
may
and
may_not
do
;
must
and
should
do
.
However
,
there
is
a
minimum
of
legislative
restriction
on
boating
.
Laws
on
boating
vary
according
to
the
state
in_which
the
craft
is
to
be
used
and
according
to
its
horsepower
.
What
may
be
acceptable
in
one
state
may
be
strictly
prohibited
across
the
boundary_line
.
The
main
requirement
is
to
be
sure
the
boat
is
numbered
according
to
the
regulations
of
the
state
in_which
the
boat
will
be
principally
used
.
If
your
state
has
no
provisions
for
the
numbering
of
pleasure_boats
,
you
must
apply
for
a
number
from
the
U._S._Coast_Guard
for
any
kind_of
boat
with
mechanical
propulsion
rated
at
more_than
10
horsepower
before
it
can
be
used
on
Federal
waterways
.
State
numbering
laws
differ
from
each
other
in
many
ways
.
Fees
are
not
the
same
and
some
states
do
not
require
certain
craft
,
such_as
sailboats
with
no
power
,
to
be
registered
at_all
.
Many
states
have
laws
regulating
the
use
of
boat
trailers
and
some
have
restrictions
regarding
the
age
of
motor
boat
operators
.
Generally
,
states
reserve
for
communities
the
right
to
have
local
ordinances
regulating
speed
and
other
activities
.
It
is
always
wise_to
consult
your
marine
dealer
,
local
yacht
or
boat
club
secretary
,
or
local
law_enforcement
officers
if
you
are
not
positive
what
the
regulations
are
.
Ignorance
of
the
law
is
no
better
excuse
on
the
water
than
it
is
on
land
;
lack
of
ability
and
common_sense
can
lead
to
just_as
much
tragedy
.
Hand_in_hand
with
the
legislative
program
is
the
industry
's
self
originated
and
directed
safety
program
.
Foreseeing
the
possible
threats
to
safety
with
the
rapid_growth
of
the
sport
,
the
industry
has
been
supporting
an
intense
,
coordinated
educational
program
with
great
success
since
1947
.
A
primary
factor
in
the
success
of
the
safety
program
has
been
the
enthusiastic
cooperation
of
the
individual
manufacturers
.
The
industry
has
been
its
own
watch
dog
.
With
U._S._Coast_Guard
cooperation
,
the
American_Boat
and
Yacht_Council
was
formed
to
develop
recommended
practices
and
standards
for
boats
and
their
equipment
with_reference_to
safety
.
Industry
interest
in
safety
goes
even
farther
.
In
1959
,
the
Yacht_Safety_Bureau
was
reorganized
by
the
National_Association
of
Engine
and
Boat
Manufacturers
and
a
group
of
insurance
underwriters
to
provide
a
testing
laboratory
and
labeling
service
for
boats
and
their
equipment
.
A
new
waterfront
site
for
the
bureau
is
now
being
built
at
Atlantic_City
,
New_Jersey
,
to
provide
the_most
modern
marine
testing
facilities
as
a
further
tool
to
keep
the
sport
safe
.
In_addition
to
these
activities
,
the
NAEBM
,
with
headquarters
at
420
lexington
Avenue
,
New_York_City
,
as_well
as
other
associations
and
individual
manufacturers
,
provide
and
distribute
films
,
booklets
,
and
public_services
in
regard_to
proper
boat
handling
and
safety
afloat
.
It
is
important
to
note
the
work
of
the
United_States
Power_Squadrons
and
the
U._S._Coast_Guard_Auxiliary
.
Each
of
these
fine
groups
gives
free
boating
classes
in
seamanship
piloting
and
small_boat
handling
.
These
are
not
governmentally
subsidized
organizations
.
This
year
,
over
100000
persons
will
receive
this
free
instruction
.
As
America
on
wheels
was
responsible_for
an
industry
of
motor
courts
,
motels
,
and
drive-in
establishments
where
you
can
dine
,
see
a
movie
,
shop
,
or
make
a
bank_deposit
,
the
ever-increasing
number
of
boating
enthusiasts
have
sparked
industries
designed
especially
to
accommodate
them
.
Instead
of
motels
,
for
the
boatman
there
are
marinas
.
The
word
marina
was
coined
by
NAEBM
originally
to
describe
a
waterfront
facility
where
recreational
boats
could
find
protection
and
basic
needs
to
lay_over
in
relative
comfort
.
Currently
,
marina
is
used
to
indicate
a
municipal
or
commercially
operated
facility
where
a
pleasure_boat
may
dock
and
find
some
or
all_of
the
following
available
:
gasoline
,
fresh
water
,
electricity
,
telephone_service
,
ice
,
repair
facilities
,
restaurants
,
sleeping
accommodations
,
a
general_store
,
and
a
grocery_store
.
Yachtel
,
a
relatively
new
word
,
indicates
a
waterfront
type
of
hotel
where
a
yachtsman
may
dock
and
find
overnight
accommodations
on
the
premises
as_well
as
other
services
.
Boatel
has
a
similar
meaning
to
yachtel
.
It
indicates
the
same
thing
but
it
is
meant
to
pertain
more
specifically
to
establishments
designed
to
cater
to
smaller
type
boats
such_as
outboards
.
Regardless_of
nomenclature
,
yachtels
and
boatels
are
marinas
.
Boatyards
which
also
provide
some
of
the
above
facilities
may
rightfully
be
called
marinas
.
A
recent
survey
disclosed
there
are
about
4000
commercially
and
municipally
operated
marinas
and
boatyards
in
the
United_States
,
the
majority
of_which
are
equipped
to
handle
outboard
boats
.
