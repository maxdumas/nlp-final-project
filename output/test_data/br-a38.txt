The
Masters
golf
tournament
proved
last
Monday
what
it
can
do
to
the
strongest
men
and
the
staunchest
nerves
.
Gary_Player
,
the
small
,
trim
South_African
,
was
the
eventual
winner
,
but
in_all
his
25
years
he
never
spent
a
more
harrowing
afternoon
as
he
waited
for
the
victory
to
drop
in
his
lap
.
Arnold_Palmer
,
the
defending
champion
,
lost
his
title
on
the
72
nd
hole
after
a_few
minutes
of
misfortune
that
left
even
his
fellow
pros
gaping
in
disbelief
.
``
Just
when
you
think
you
have
it
licked
,
this
golf_course
can
get_up
and
bite
you
''
,
Player
had
said
one
afternoon
midway
through
the
tournament
.
And
that
is
just
what
happened
on
the
last
few
holes
.
The
Augusta_National
Golf_Club
Course
got_up
and
bit
both
Player
and
Palmer
.
Player
was
the
first
to
feel
its
teeth
.
After
playing
a
splendid
first
nine
holes
in
34
-
two
strokes
under
par
-
on
this
fifth
and
final
day
of
the
tournament
(
Sunday
's
fourth
round
had
been
washed_out
by
a
violent
rainstorm
when
it
was
only
half
completed
)
,
Player
's
game
rapidly
fell
to
pieces
.
He
bogeyed
the
10
th
.
After
a
journey
through
woods
and
stream
he
double-bogeyed
the
13
th
.
He
bogeyed
the
15
th
by
missing
a
short
putt
and
finally
scrambled
through
the
last
three
holes
without
further
mishap
for
a
2
-
over-par
74
and
a
72
-
hole
total
of
280
.
As
he
signed
his
scorecard
and
walked
off
the
course
,
Player
was
almost
in
tears
.
He
could
read
on
the
nearby
scoreboard
that
Palmer
,
by
then
playing
the
15
th
hole
,
was
leading
him
by
a
stroke
.
Palmer
had
started
the
round
four
strokes
behind
Player
,
and
at
one
point
in
the
afternoon
had
trailed
by
as_many
as
six
strokes
.
Now
all
he
had
to
do
was
finish
in
even
par
to
collect
the
trophy
and
the
biggest
single
paycheck
in
golf
.
When
Palmer
hit
a
good
straight
drive
up
the
fairway
on
the
72
nd
hole
,
he
seemed
to
have
the
championship
won
.
But
the
seven-iron
shot
he
used
to
approach
the
green
strayed
into
a
bunker
and
lodged
in
a
slight
depression
.
In
trying
to
hit
it
out
with
a
sand_wedge
Palmer
bounced
the
ball
over
the
green
,
past
spectators
and
down
the
slope
toward
a
TV
tower
.
Afterwards
,
Palmer
told
Charlie_Coe
,
his
last-round
partner
,
that
he
simply
played
the
hole
too
fast
.
He
did
seem
hasty
on
his
second
and
third
shots
,
but
then
there
was
an
agonizing
wait
of
several
minutes
while
Coe
graciously
putted
out
,
giving
Palmer
a
chance
to
recover
his
composure
,
which
he
had
quite
visibly
lost
.
When
the
shaken
Palmer
finally
did
hit
his
fourth
shot
,
he
overshot
the
hole
by
15
feet
.
Palmer
was
now
putting
merely
for
a
tie
,
and
Player
,
who
was
sitting
beside
his
wife
and
watching
it
all
on
television
in
Tournament_Chairman_Clifford_Roberts
'
clubhouse
apartment
,
stared
in
amazement
when
Palmer
missed
the
putt
.
Palmer
's
281
for
the
four
rounds
at
Augusta
was
a
comfortable
four
strokes
ahead
of
the
next
closest
pro
,
but
it
was
barely
good
enough
for
a
second-place
tie
with
Coe
.
The
lean
and
leathery
Oklahoma
amateur
,
who
has
been
playing
topnotch
tournament
golf
for
many
years
,
refused
to
let
the
Masters
jitters
overtake
him
and
closed
the
tournament
with
his
second
straight
69
.
Until
late
last
Saturday
afternoon
Palmer
had
played
seven
consecutive
rounds_of_golf
at
the
Masters
-
four
last
year
and
three
this
-
without
ever
being
out
of
first
place
.
As
evening
approached
and
Palmer
finished
his
Saturday
round
with
a
disappointing
one-over-par
73
,
this
remarkable
record
was
still
intact
,
thanks
to
his
Thursday
and
Friday
rounds
of
68
and
69
.
His
three-round
total
of
210
was
three
strokes
better
than
the
next
best
score
,
a
213
by
Bill_Collins
,
the
tall
and
deliberate
Baltimorean
who
had
been
playing
very_well
all
winter
long
.
But
Palmer
knew
,
as
did
everybody
else
at
Augusta
,
that
his
streak
was
about
to
be
broken
.
Half
an
hour
after
he
finished
his
round
,
Player
holed_out
at
the
18
th
green
with
a
69
and
a
three-round
total
of
206
,
four
strokes
ahead
of
Palmer
.
More_than
a
streak
had
ended
.
Long
after
the
erratic
climate
and
the
washed-out
final
round
on
Sunday
have
become
meteorological
footnotes
,
the
1961
Masters
will
be
remembered
as
the
scene
of
the
mano
a
mano
between
Arnold_Palmer
and
Gary_Player
.
Unlike
most
such
sports
rivalries
,
it
appeared
to
have
developed
almost
spontaneously
,
although
this
was
not
exactly
the
case
.
When
the
winter
tour
began
at
Los_Angeles
last
January
there
was
no
one
in_sight
to
challenge
Palmer
's
towering
prestige
.
As
if
to
confirm
his
stature
,
he
quickly
won
three
of
the
first
eight
tournaments
.
Player
won
only
one
.
But
as
the
tour
reached
Pensacola
a
month
ago
,
Player
was
leading
Palmer
in
official
winnings
by
a_few
hundred
dollars
,
and
the
rest
of
the
field
was
somewhere
off
in
nowhere
.
On
the
final
round
at
Pensacola
,
the
luck
of
the
draw
paired
Palmer
and
Player
in
the
same
threesome
and
,
although
it
was
far
from
obvious
at_the_time
,
the
gallery
was
treated
to
the
first
chapter
of_what
promises
to
be
one
of
the_most
exciting
duels
in
sport
for
a
long_time
to
come
.
On_that
final
Sunday
at
Pensacola
neither
Palmer
nor
Player
was
leading
the
tournament
and
,
as
it
turned_out
,
neither
won
it
.
But
whichever
of
these
two
finished
ahead
of
the
other
would
be
the
undisputed
financial
leader
of
the
tour
.
Player
immediately
proved
he
was
not
in_the_least
awed
by
the
dramatic
proximity
of
Palmer
.
He
outplayed
Palmer
all_around
the
course
and
finished
with
a
tremendous
65
to
Palmer
's
71
.
Thereafter
,
until
the
Masters
,
Player
gradually
increased
his
lead
over
Palmer
in
winnings
and
added
one
more
tournament
victory
at
Miami
.
When
they
reached
Augusta
last
week
,
together
they
had
won
five
of
the
13
tournaments
to_date
.
On
Thursday
,
the
first
day
of
the
Masters
,
the
contest
between
Palmer
and
Player
developed
instantly
.
It
was
a
dismal
,
drizzly
day
but
a
good
one
on_which
to
score
over
the
Augusta_National
course
.
The
usually
skiddy
greens
were
moist
and
soft
,
so
the
golfers
were
able
to
strike
their
approach_shots
boldly
at
the
flag-stick
and
putt
firmly
toward
the
hole
without
too_much
worry
about
the
consequences
.
Palmer
's
4
-
under-par
68
got
him
off
to
an
early
lead
,
which
he
shared
with
Bob_Rosburg
.
But
Player
was
only
one
stroke
back
,
with
a
69
.
Even_so
,
it
was
still
not
clear
to
many
in
the
enormous
horde
of
spectators
-
unquestionably
the
largest
golf
crowd
ever
-
that
this
tournament
was
to
be
,
essentially
,
a
match
between
Palmer
and
Player
.
A_lot_of
people
were
still
thinking_about
Jack_Nicklaus
,
the
spectacular
young
amateur
,
who
had
a
70
;
or
Ken_Venturi
,
who
had
a
somewhat
shaky
72
but
was
bound_to
do
better
;
or
Rosburg
,
whose
accurate
short
game
and
supersensitive
putter
can
overcome
so
many_of
Augusta
's
treacheries
;
or
even
old
Byron_Nelson
,
whose
excellent
71
made
one
wonder
if
he
had
solved
the
geriatric
aspects
of
golf
.
(
On
Thursday
nobody
except
Charlie_Coe
was
thinking_of
Charlie_Coe
.
)
On
Friday
,
a
day
as
cloudless
and
lovely
as
Thursday
had
been
gray
and
ugly
,
the
plot
of
the
tournament
came
clearly
into
focus
.
Rosburg
had
started
early
in
the
day
,
and
by
the
time
Palmer
and
Player
were
on
the
course
-
separated
,
as
they
were
destined
to
be
for
the
rest
of
the
weekend
,
by
about
half
an
hour
-
they
could
see
on
the
numerous
scoreboards
spotted
around
the
course
that
Rosburg
,
who
ended
with
a
73
,
was
not
having
a
good_day
.
As
Player
began
his
second
round
in
a
twosome
with
amateur
Bill_Hyndman
,
his
share
of
the
gallery
was
not
conspicuously
large
for
a
contender
.
Player
began
with
a
birdie
on
the
first
hole
,
added
five
straight
pars
and_then
another
birdie
at
the
9
th
.
On
the
back
nine
he
began
to
acquire
the
tidal_wave
of
a
gallery
that
stayed
with
him
the
rest
of
the
tournament
.
He
birdied
the
13
th
,
the
15
th
and
the
18
th
-
five
birdies
,
one
bogey
and
12
pars
for
a
68
.
Starting
half
an
hour
behind
Player
in
company
with
British
Open_Champion_Kel_Nagle
,
Palmer
birdied
the
2
nd
,
the
9
th
,
the
13
th
and
the
16
th
-
four
birdies
,
one
bogey
and
13
pars
for
a
69
.
The
roar
of
Palmer
's
gallery
as
he
sank
a
thrilling
putt
would
roll
out
across
the
parklike
landscape
of
Augusta
,
only
to
be
answered
moments
later
by
the
roar
of
Player
's
gallery
for
a
similar
triumph
.
At
one
point
late
in
the
day
,
when
Palmer
was
lining_up
a
25
-
foot
putt
on
the
16
th
,
a
thunderous
cheer
from
the
direction
of
the
18
th
green
unmistakably
announced
that
Player
had
birdied
the
final
hole
.
Without
so_much
as
a
grimace
or
a
gesture
to
show
that
he
had
noticed
(
although
he
later
admitted
that
he
had
)
Palmer
proceeded
to
sink
his
25
-
footer
,
and
his
gallery
sent
its
explosive
vocalization
rolling
back
along
the
intervening
fairways
in_reply
.
Anyone
who
now
doubted
that
a
personal
duel
was
under_way
had
only
to
watch
how
these
exceptionally
gifted
golfers
were
playing
this
most
difficult
golf_course
.
It
is
almost
axiomatic
that
golfers
who
dominate
the
game
of
golf
for
any
period_of_time
attack
their
shots
with
a
vehemence
bordering_on
violence
.
The
bad_luck
that
can
so
often
mar
a
well-played
round_of_golf
is
simply
overpowered
and
obliterated
by
the
contemptuous
boldness
of
these
champions
.
Bob_Jones
played
that
way
.
Byron_Nelson
did
,
Hogan
did
.
And
last
week
at
the
Masters_Palmer
and
Player
did
.
As
the
third
round
of
the
tournament
began
on
Saturday
and
the
duel
was
resumed
in_earnest
,
it
was
Player
's
superior
aggressiveness
that
carried
him
into
the
lead
.
This
day
Palmer
had
started
first
.
As
Player
stepped
on
the
first
tee
he
knew
that
Palmer
had
birdied
the
first
two
holes
and
already
was
2
under
par
for
the
day
.
Player
immediately
proceeded
to
follow_suit
.
In_fact
,
he
went_on
to
birdie
the
6
th
and
8
th
as_well
,
to
go
4
under
par
for
the
first
eight
holes
.
But
Player
's
real
test
came
on
the
ninth
hole
,
a
downhill
dogleg
to
the
left
measuring
420
yards
.
He
hit
a
poor
tee
shot
,
pulling
it
off
into
the
pine
woods
separating
the
9
th
and
first
fairways
.
Having
hit
one
of
the
trees
,
the
ball
came
to
rest
not
more_than
160
yards
out
.
Player
then
had
the
choice
of
punching
the
ball
safely
out
of
the
woods
to
the
9
th
fairway
and
settling
for
a
bogey
5
,
or
gambling
.
The
latter
involved
hitting
a
full
four-wood
out
to
the
first
fairway
and
toward
the
clubhouse
,
hoping
to
slice
it
back
to
the
deeply
bunkered
9
th
green
.
``
I
was
hitting
the
ball
well
''
,
Player
said
later
,
``
and
I
felt
strong
.
When
you
're
playing
like
that
you
'd
better
attack
''
.
Player
attacked
with
his
four-wood
and
hit
a
shot
that
few
who
saw
it
will
ever
forget
.
It
struck
the
9
th
green
on_the_fly
and
stopped
just
off
the
edge
.
From
there
he
chipped
back
and
sank
his
putt
for
a
par
4
.
Palmer
,
meanwhile
,
had
been
having
his
troubles
.
They
started
on
the
4
th
hole
,
a
220
-
yard
par-3
.
On_this_day
the
wind
had
switched
180
`
from
the
northwest
to
the
southeast
,
and
nearly
every
shot
on
the
course
was
different
from
the
previous
few
days
.
At
the
4
th
tee
Palmer
chose
to
hit
a
one-iron
when
a
three-wood
was
the
proper
club
,
so
he
put
the
ball
in
a
bunker
in_front
of
the
green
.
His
bogey
4
on
this
hole
and
subsequent
bogeys
at
5
and
7
along
with
a
birdie
at
8
brought
him
back
to
even
par
.
Starting
the
second
nine
,
Palmer
was
already
four
strokes
behind
Player
and
knew
it
.
