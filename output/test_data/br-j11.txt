Many
other
(
probably
nearly
all
)
snakes
at
maturity
are
already
more_than
half
their
final
length
.
Laurence_M_._Klauber
put
length
at
maturity
at
two
thirds
the
ultimate
length
for
some
rattlesnakes
,
and
Charles_C_._Carpenter
's
data
on
Michigan
garter
and
ribbon_snakes
(
Thamnophis
)
show
that
the
smallest
gravid
females
are
more_than
half
as
long
as
the
biggest
adults
.
Felix_Kopstein
states
that
``
when
the
snake
reaches
its
maturity
it
has
already
reached
about
its
maximal
length
''
,
but
goes_on
to
cite
the
reticulate
python
as
an
exception
,
with
maximum
length
approximately
three_times
that
at
maturity
.
It
is
hard
to
understand
how
he
concluded
that
most
snakes
do
not
grow
appreciably
after
attaining
maturity
;
he
was
working
with
species
of
Java
,
so
perhaps
some
tropical
snakes
are
unusual
in
this
respect
.
Certain
individual
giants
recorded
later
did
fail
to
show
a
reasonable
difference
after
maturity
,
but
it
is
impossible
to
know
whether
this
is_due
to
captive
conditions
.
Additional
records
of
slow
growth
have
been
omitted
.
It
is
possible
to
make
a_few
generalizations
about
the
six
giants
themselves
.
There
seems
to
be
a
rough
correlation
between
the
initial
and
ultimate
lengths
,
starting
with
the
smallest
(
boa_constrictor
)
and
ending
with
the
largest
(
anaconda
)
.
Data
on
the
former
are
scanty
,
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
latter
is
sometimes
born
at
a
length
greater
than
that
of
any
of
the
others
,
thereby
lending
support
to
the
belief
that
the
anaconda
does
,
indeed
,
attain
the
greatest
length
.
For
four
of
the
six
(
the
anaconda
and
the
amethystine_python
cannot
be
included
for
lack
of
data
)
there
is
also
a
correlation
between
size
at
maturity
and
maximum
length
,
the
boa_constrictor
being
the
smallest
and
the
Indian_python
the
next
in
size
at
the
former
stage
.
Let
us
speculate
a_little
on
the
maximum
size
of
the
anaconda
.
If
,
in
a
certain
part
of
the
range
,
it
starts
life
1
foot
longer
than
do
any
of
the
other
(
relatively
large
)
giants
,
and
reaches
maturity
at
,
let
us
guess
,
18
inches
longer
than
the
others
,
a
quadrupling
of
the
maturity
length
would
result
in
a
maximum
of
(
nearly
)
40
feet
.
When
it
comes_to
rate
of
early
growth
,
the
Indian_python
leads
with
a
figure
of
about
3
feet
6
inches
per_year
for
the
first
two
years
,
more_or_less
.
The
African
rock_python
,
a
close
second
,
is
followed
in_turn
by
the
reticulate
python
.
There
are
few
data
on
the
boa_constrictor
,
those
for
the
anaconda
are
unconvincing
,
and
there
is
nothing
at_all
on
the
amethystine_python
.
It
seems
likely
that
the
Indian_python
comes_out
ahead
because
records
of
its
growth
have
been
made
more
carefully
and
frequently
;
it
responds
exceptionally
well
to
captivity
and
does
not
reach
proportions
that
make
it
hard
to
keep
.
I
cannot
make
sense
out
of
the
figures
for
post
maturity
growth
;
at_best
the
annual
increase
appears
to
be
a
matter
of
inches
rather_than
feet
.
Until
better
records
have
been
kept
over
longer
periods_of_time
and
much
more
is
known
about
the
maximum
dimensions
,
it
will
be
wise
to
refrain_from
drawing
conclusions
.
It
is
often
stated
that
the
largest
snakes
require
five
years
to
attain
maturity
,
but
this
apparently
is
an
overestimation
.
The
best
way
to
determine
the
correct
figure
(
in
captives
)
is
by
direct
observation
of
pairs
isolated
from
birth
,
a
method
that
produced
surprising
results
:
maturing
of
a
male
Indian_python
in
less_than
two
years
,
his
mate
in
less_than
three
;
data
on
the
boa_constrictor
about
match
this
.
Another
approach
is
to
estimate
from
the
rate_of_growth
and
the
smallest
size
at
maturity
.
Results
from
this
approach
amply
confirm
the
direct
observations
:
about
three
years
are
required
,
there
being
a
possible
slight
difference
between
males
and
females
in
the
time
required
.
Only
the
amethystine_python
and
the
anaconda
must
be
excluded
for
lack
or
paucity
of
data
.
The
following
information
on
snakes
varying
greatly
in
size
(
but
all
with
less_than
a
10
-
foot
maximum
)
shows
,
when
considered
with
the
foregoing
,
that
there
is
probably
no
correlation
between
the
length
of
a
snake
and
the
time
required
for
it
to
mature
.
Oliver
,
in
his
summary
of
the
habits
of
the
snakes
of
the
United_States
,
could
supply
data
on
the
maturing
period
for
only
three
species
in_addition_to
the
rattlers
,
which
I
shall
consider
separately
.
These
three
were
much
alike
:
lined_snake
(
Tropidoclonion
)
,
one
year
and
nine
months
;
red-bellied_snake
(
Storeria
)
,
two
years
;
cottonmouth
(
Ancistrodon
)
,
two
years
.
Klauber
investigated
the
rattlesnakes
carefully
himself
and
also
summarized
what
others
have
found
.
He
concluded
that
in
the
southern
species
,
which
are
rapidly
growing
types
,
females
mate
at
the
age
of
two
and
a
half
and
bear
the
first
young
when
they
are
three
.
Other
herpetologists
have
ascertained
that
in
the
northern
United_States
the
prairie_rattlesnake
may_not
give
first
birth
until
it
is
four
or
even
five
years
old
,
and
that
the
young
may
be_born
every_other
year
,
rather_than
annually
.
Carpenter
's
study
showed
that
female
common
garter
and
ribbon_snakes
of
Michigan
mature
at
about
the
age
of
two
.
Oversized
monsters
are
never
brought
home
either
alive
or
preserved
,
and
field
measurements
are
obviously
open_to
doubt
because
of
the
universal
tendency
to
exaggerate
dimensions
.
Measurements
of
skins
are
of
little
value
;
every
snake
hide
is
noticeably
longer
than
its
carcass
and
intentional
stretching
presents
no
difficulty
to
the
unscrupulous
explorer
.
In_spite
of
all
the
pitfalls
,
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
agreement
on
some
of
the
giants
.
The
anaconda
proves
to
be
the
fly_in_the_ointment
,
but
the
reason
for
this
is
not
clear
;
the
relatively
wild
conditions
still
found
in
tropical
South_America
might
be
responsible
.
There
are
three
levels
on
which
to
treat
the
subject
.
The
first
is
the
strictly
scientific
,
which
demands
concrete
proof
and
therefore
may
err
on
the
conservative
side
by
waiting
for
evidence
in_the_flesh
.
This
approach
rejects
virtually
all
field
measurements
.
The
next
level
attempts
to
weigh
varied
evidence
and
come
to
a
balanced
,
sensible
conclusion
;
field
measurements
by
experienced
explorers
are
not
rejected
,
and
even
reports
of
a
less
scientific
nature
are
duly
evaluated
.
The
third
level
leans_on
a
belief
that
a_lot
of
smoke
means
some
fire
.
The
argument
against
this
last
approach
is
comparable_to
that
which
rejects
stories
about
hoop_snakes
,
about
snakes
that
break
themselves
into
many
pieces
and
join
up
again
,
or
even
of
ghosts
that
chase
people
out
of
graveyards
;
the
mere
piling_up
of
testimony
does
not
prove
,
to
the
scientific
mind
,
the
existence
of
hoop_snakes
,
joint_snakes
,
or
ghosts
.
Oliver
has
recently
used
the
second
level
approach
with
the
largest
snakes
,
and
has
come
to
these
conclusions
:
the
anaconda
reaches
a
length
of
at_least
37
feet
,
the
reticulate
python
33
,
the
African
rock_python
25
,
the
amethystine_python
at_least
22
,
the
Indian_python
20
,
and
the
boa_constrictor
18
-
1_2
.
Bernard_Heuvelmans
also
treats
of
the
largest
snakes
,
but
on
the
third
level
,
and
is
chiefly
concerned
with
the
anaconda
.
He
reasons
that
as
anacondas
30
feet
long
are
often
found
,
some
might
be
38
,
and
occasional
``
monstrous
freaks
''
over
50
.
He
rejects
dimensions
of
70
feet
and
more
.
His
thirteenth
chapter
includes
many
exciting
accounts
of
huge
serpents
with
prodigious
strength
,
but
these
seem
to
be
given
to
complete
his
picture
,
not
to
be
believed
.
Detailed
information
on
record
lengths
of
the
giants
is
given
in
the
section
that
follows
.
Discussions
of
the
giants
one_by_one
will
include
,
as_far_as_possible
,
data
on
these
aspects
of
growth
:
size
at
which
life
is
started
and
at
which
sexual
maturity
is
reached
;
time
required
to
reach
maturity
;
rate_of_growth
both
before
and
after
this
crucial
stage
;
and
maximum
length
,
with
confirmation
or
amplification
of
Oliver
's
figures
.
Definite
information
on
the
growth
of
senile
individuals
is
lacking
.
At_birth
,
this
species
varies
considerably
in
size
.
A
brood
of
twenty-eight
born
at
Brookfield_Zoo
,
near
Chicago
,
ranged
in_length
from
22
to
33
-
1
2
inches
and
averaged
29
inches
.
Lawrence_E_._Griffin
gives
measurements
of
nineteen
young
anacondas
,
presumably
members
of
a
brood
,
from
``
South_America
''
;
the
extreme
measurements
of
these
fall
between
the
lower_limit
of
the
Brookfield
brood
and
its
average
.
Raymond_L_._Ditmars
had
two
broods
that
averaged
27
inches
.
R_._R_._Mole
and
F_._W_._Urich
give
approximately
20
inches
as
the
average
length
of
a
brood
of
thirty
from
the
region
of
the
Orinoco
estuaries
.
William_Beebe
reports
26
inches
and
2.4
ounces
(
this
snake
must
have
been
emaciated
)
for
the
length
and
the
weight
of
a
young
anaconda
from
British_Guiana
.
In
contrast
,
Ditmars
recorded
the
average
length
of
seventy-two
young
of
a
19
-
foot
female
as
38
inches
,
and
four
young
were_born
in
London
at
a
length
of
35
or
36
inches
and
a
weight
of
from
14
to
16
ounces
.
Beebe
had
a
3
-
foot
anaconda
that
weighed
only
9.8
ounces
.
A
difference
between
subspecies
might
explain
the
great
range
in
size
.
I
have
little
information
on
the
anaconda
's
rate_of_growth
.
Hans_Schweizer
had
one
that
increased
from
19
-
1
2
inches
to
5
feet
3
inches
in
five
years
,
and
J_._J_._Quelch
records
a
growth
of
from
less_than
4
feet
to
nearly
10
in
about
six
years
.
It
is
very
unlikely
that
either
of
these
anacondas
was
growing
at
a
normal
rate
.
In
1948
,
Afranio_do_Amaral
,
the
noted
Brazilian
herpetologist
,
wrote
a
technical
paper
on
the
giant
snakes
.
He
concluded
that
the
anaconda
's
maximum
length
is
12
or
13
(
perhaps
14
)
meters
,
which
would
approximate
from
39
to
42
feet
(
14
meters
is
slightly
less
that
46
feet
)
.
Thus
,
his
estimate
lies
between
Oliver
's
suggestion
of
at_least
37
feet
and
the
50
-
foot
``
monstrous
freaks
''
intimated
by
Heuvelmans
.
The
most
convincing
recent
measurement
of
an
anaconda
was
made
in
eastern
Colombia
by
Roberto_Lamon
,
a
petroleum_geologist
of
the
Richmond_Oil_Company
,
and
reported
in
1944
by
Emmett_R_._Dunn
.
However
,
as
a
field
measurement
,
it
is
open_to
question
.
Oliver
's
37
-
1
2
feet
is
partly
based
on
this
report
and
can
be
accepted
as
probable
.
However
,
many
herpetologists
remain
skeptical
and
would
prefer
a
tentative
maximum
of
about
30
feet
.
It
is
possible
that
especially
large
anacondas
will
prove
to
belong_to
subspecies
limited
to
a
small
area
.
In
snakes
difference
in
size
is
a
common
characteristic
of
subspecies
.
A
Colombian
female
's
brood
of
sixteen
boa_constrictors
born
in
the
Staten_Island_Zoo
averaged
20
inches
.
This
birth
length
seems
to
be
typical
.
When
some
thirteen
records
of
newly
and
recently
born
individuals
are
collated
,
little
or
no
correlation
between
length
and
distribution
can
be
detected
.
The
range
is
from
14
to
25
inches
;
the
former
figure
is
based
on
a
somewhat
unusual
birth
of
four
by
a
Central_American
female
(
see
chapter
on
Laying
,
Brooding
,
Hatching
,
and
Birth
)
,
the
latter
on
a
``
normal
''
newly
born
individual
.
However
,
as
so
many
of
the
records
are
not
certainly
based
on
newborn
snakes
,
these
data
must
be
taken
tentatively
;
final
conclusions
will
have_to
await
the
measurements
of
broods
from
definite
localities
.
Alphonse_R_._Hoge
's
measurements
of
several
very
young
specimens
from
Brazil
suggest
that
at_birth
the
female
is
slightly
larger
than
the
male
.
I
have
surprisingly
little
information
on
the
size
and
age
at
maturity
.
Carl_Kauffeld
has
written
to
me
of
sexual_activity
in
February
1943
of
young
born
in
March
1940
.
One
female
,
collected
on
an
island
off
the
coast
of
Nicaragua
,
was
gravid
and
measured
4
feet
8
inches
from
snout
to
vent
(
her
tail
should
be
between
6
and
7
inches
long
)
.
The
female
from
Central_America
which
gave_birth
to
four
was
only
3
feet
11
inches
long
.
What
data
there
are
on
growth
indicate
considerable
variation
in
rate
;
unfortunately
,
no_one
has
kept
complete
records
of
one
individual
,
whereas
many
have
been
made
for
a
very
short
period_of_time
.
The
results
are
too
varied
to
allow
generalization
.
