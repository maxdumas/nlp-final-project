Some
recent
writings
assume
that
the
ignorant
young
couples
are
a
thing
of
the
remote
,
Victorian
past
;
that
nowadays
all
honeymooners
are
thoroughly
familiar_with
the
best
sex-manuals
and
know
enough
from
talk
with
friends
and
personal
experimentation
to
take
all
the
anxiety
and
hazards
out
of
the
situation
.
Perhaps
-
but
extensive
discussions
with
contemporary
practitioners
,
family_doctors
and
gynecologists
indicate
that
this
is
still
an
area
of
enormous
ignorance
.
Joking
and
talking
may
be
freer
and
easier
,
but
the
important
factual
information
is
still
lacking
for
far
too
many
newly-married
men
and
women
.
Various
factors
in
the
setting
can
still
be
of
great
advantage
in
making
the
first
intercourse
a
good
rather_than
a
bad
memory
for
one
or
both
.
Privacy
must
be
highly
assured
both
in_time
and
place
.
That_is
,
locking
the
room
or
stateroom
door
gives
privacy
of
location
,
but
it
is
equally
important
to
be
sure
there
is
time
enough
for
an
utterly
unhurried
fulfillment
.
If
the
wedding_party
lasted
late
,
and
the
travel
schedule
means
there
are
only
a_few
hours
before
resuming
the
trip
or
making
an
early
start
,
the
husband
may
forestall
tensions
and
uncertainties
by
confiding
to
his
bride
that
lying
in
each
other
's
arms
will
be
bliss
enough
for
these
few
hours
.
The
consummation
should
come
at
the
next
stopping
place
when
they
have
a
long
private
time
(
day
or
night
)
for
that
purpose
.
First
intercourse
for
the
bride
brings
with
it
the
various
problems
connected
with
virginity
and
the
hymen
.
One
thing
should
be
clear
to
both
husband
and
wife
-
neither
pain
nor
profuse
bleeding
has_to
occur
when
the
hymen
is
ruptured
during
the
first
sex_act
.
Ignorance
on
this
point
has
caused
a
great_deal
of
needless
anxiety
,
misunderstanding
and
suspicion
.
The
hymen
is
,
in_essence
,
a
fragile
membrane
that
more_or_less
completely
covers
the
entrance
to
the
vagina
in
most
female
human_beings
who
have
not
had
sex
relations
.
(
Hymen
,
in_fact
,
is
the
Greek
word
for
membrane
.
)
Often
it
is
thin
and
fragile
and
gives_way
readily
to
the
male
organ
at
the
first
attempt
at
intercourse
.
As_might_be_expected
,
girls
in_this
situation
bleed
very
little
and
perhaps
not_at_all
in
the
process
of
losing
their
virginity
.
It
is
also
important
to
realize
that
many
girls
are_born
without
a
hymen
or
at_most
only
a
tiny
trace
of
one
;
so_that
the
absence
of
the
hymen
is
by_no_means
positive
proof
that
a
girl
has
had
sex
relations
.
But
there
is
a
basis
in_fact
for
the
exaggerations
of
the
folk-lore
beliefs
.
Some
hymens
are
so
strongly
developed
that
they
cannot
be
torn
without
considerable
pain
to
the
girl
and
marked
loss
of
blood
.
More
rarely
,
the
hymen
is
so
sturdy
that
it
does
not
yield
to
penetration
.
Extreme
cases
are
on
record
in_which
the
doctor
has
had
to
use
instruments
to
cut
through
the
hymen
to
permit
marital
relations_to
be
consummated
.
These
cases
,
for
all
their
rarity
,
are
so
dramatic
that
friends
and
relations
repeat
the
story
until
the
general
population
may
get
an
entirely
false
notion
of
how
often
the
hymen
is
a
serious
problem
to
newly-weds
.
In_recent_times
,
when
sexual
matters
began
to
be
discussed
more
scientifically
and
more
openly
,
the
emotional
aspects
of
virginity
received
considerable
attention
.
Obviously
,
the
bridal
pair
has
many
adjustments
to
make
to
their
new
situation
.
Is
it
necessary
to
add
to
the
other
tensions
the
hazard
of
making
the
loving
husband
the
one
who
brought
pain
to
his
bride
?
Gynecologists
and
marriage
manuals
began
to
advise
that
the
bride
should
consult
a
physician
before
marriage
.
If
he
foresaw
any
problem
because
of
the
quality
of
the
hymen
,
it
was
recommended
that
simple
procedures
be
undertaken
at_once
to
incise
the
hymen
or
,
preferably
,
to
dilate
it
.
As
a
natural
outgrowth
of_this
approach
it
was
often
suggested
that
the
doctor
should
complete
the
preparation
for
painless
intercourse
by
dilating
the
vagina
.
This
recommendation
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
hymen
was
not
the
only
barrier
to
smooth
consummation
of
the
sex_act
.
The
vagina
is
an
organ
capable_of
remarkable
contraction
and
dilation
.
This
is
obvious
when
it
is
remembered
that
,
during
childbirth
,
the
vagina
must
dilate
enough
to
permit
the
passage
of
the
baby
.
The
intricate
system
of
muscles
that
manage
the
contraction
and
dilatation
of
the
vagina
are
partly
under
voluntary
control
.
But
an
instinctive
reflex
may
work
against
the
conscious
intention
of
the
woman
.
That_is
,
when
first
penetration
takes_place
,
the
pressure
and
pain
signals
may
involuntarily
cause
all
the
vaginal
muscles
to
contract
in
an
effort
to
bar
the
intrusion
and
prevent
further
pain
.
The
advantages
of
dilatation
by
the
physician
are
both
physical
and
psychological
.
Since
it
is
a
purely
professional
situation
,
none
of
the
pain
is
associated
with
love-making
or
the
beloved
.
By
using
instruments
of
gradually
increasing
size
,
the
vagina
is
gently
,
and
with
minimum
pain
at
each
stage
,
taught
to
yield
to
an
object
of
the
appropriate
shape
.
In_this
process
the
vaginal
muscles
come
under
better
conscious
control
by
the
girl
.
She
learns
how
to
relax
them
to
accept
-
instead
of
contracting
them
to
repel
the
entering
object
.
Apart
from
the
standard
problem
of
controlling
the
vaginal
muscles
,
other
serious
barriers
may
exist
that
need
special
gynecological
treatment
.
It
is
far
better
to
have
such
conditions
treated
in_advance
than
to
have
them
show_up
on
the
honeymoon
where
they
can
create
a
really
serious
situation
.
When
no
medical
problems
exist
,
the
newly
married_couple
generally
prefer
to
cope_with
the
adjustments
of
their
new
relationship
by
themselves
.
Special
information
and
guidance
about
the
possible
difficulties
are
still
of
great
value
.
Folk-lore
,
superstition
and
remembered
passages
from
erotic
literature
can
create
physical
and
emotional
problems
if
blindly
taken
as
scientific
facts
and
useful
hints
.
The
importance
of
loving
tenderness
is
obvious
.
The
long
,
unhurried
approach
and
the
deliberate
prolongation
of
fore-play
work
on
several
levels
.
Under
the
excitement
of
caresses
and
sexual
stimulation
the
vagina
relaxes
and
dilates
and
the
local
moisture
greatly
increases
,
providing
an
excellent
lubricant
to
help
achieve
an
easier
penetration
.
Extensive
observations
by
physicians
during
vaginal
examinations
have
established
the
fact
that
a
single
finger
inserted
along
the
anterior
wall
(
the
top
line
of
the
vagina
as
the
woman
lies
on
her
back
)
may
cause
a
great_deal
of
distress
in
a
virgin
.
But
during
the
same
examination
,
two
fingers
may
be
inserted
along
the
posterior
wall
(
the
bottom
of
the
vagina
in
the
same
position
)
without
any
pain
;
and
in_fact
without
any
difficulty
if
the
pressure
is
kept
downward
at_all_times
.
These
regional
differences
of
sensitivity
to
pain
may
be
of
crucial
significance
during
the
earliest
intercourse
.
The
husband
and
wife
should
start
with
this
anatomical
information
clearly
in
mind
.
They
may
then
adjust
their
positions
and
movements
to
avoid
too_much
pressure
on
the
urethra
and
the
anterior
wall
of
the
vagina
;
at_least
until
repeated
intercourse
has
dilated
it
and
pain
is
no_longer
a
possible
threat
against
the
full
pleasure
of
love-making
.
In_fact
,
the
technical
procedure
in
medical_examinations
may
be
wisely
adapted
to
his
romantic
purposes
by
the
husband
during
the
honeymoon
.
Locker-room
talk
often
stresses
the
idea
that
a
man
is
doing
the
girl
a
favor
if
he
is
forceful
and
ruthless
during
the
first
penetration
.
The
false
reasoning
is
that
a
gradual
advance
prolongs
the
pain
while
a
swift
powerful
act
gets
it
over
with
and
leaves
the
girl
pleased
with
his
virility
and
grateful
for
his
decisiveness
in
settling
the
problem
once_and_for_all
.
Such
talk
is
seriously
in
error
.
Ruthlessness
at
this
time
can
be
a
very
severe
shock
to
the
bride
,
both
physically
and
psychologically
.
The
insistent
,
forceful
penetration
may
tear
and
inflame
the
vaginal
walls
as_well
as
do
excessive
damage
to
the
hymen
.
The
pain
and
distress
associated
with
the
performance
may
easily
give
the
wife
a
deep-seated
dread
of
marital
relations
and
cause
her
,
unconsciously
,
to
make
the
sex_act
unpleasant
and
difficult
for
both
by
exercising
her
vaginal
muscles
to
complicate
his
penetration
instead
of
relaxing
them
to
facilitate
it
.
Serious
attention
must
also
be
given
to
the
husband
's
problems
in
the
honeymoon
situation
.
The
necessity
for
keeping
alert
to
his
bride
's
hazards
can
act_as
an
interference
with
the
man
's
spontaneous
desire
.
The
emotional
stimulation
may
be
so
great
that
he
may
experience
a
premature
climax
.
This
is
a
very
common
experience
and
should
in_no_way
discourage
or
dishearten
either
husband
or
wife
.
Or
the
frequent
need
to
check
and
discipline
himself
to
the
wisest
pace
of
the
consummation
can
put
him
off
stride
and
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
be
continuously
ready
for
penetration
over
a
long
period
.
The
signals
to
proceed
may
therefore
come
when
he
is
momentarily
not
able
to
take_advantage
IN
them
.
The
best
course
is
to
recover
his
physical
excitement
by
a
change
of
pace
that
makes
him
ardent
again
.
This
may
require
imagination
and
reminding
himself
that
now
he
can
be
demanding
and
self-centered
.
He
can
take
security
from
the
fact
that
the
progress
he
has
made
by
his
gentle
approach
will
not
be
lost
.
Now
while
he
uses
talk
,
caresses
or
requires
caresses
from
her
,
his
bride
will
sympathetically
understand
the
situation
and
eagerly
help
him
restore
his
physical
situation
so
they
can
have
the
consummation
they
both
so
eagerly
desire
.
A
final
word
.
The
accumulated
information
on
this
point
shows
that
first
intercourse
,
even
when
it
is
achieved
with
minimum
pain
or
difficulty
,
is
seldom
an
overwhelming
sexual
experience
to
a
woman
.
Too
many
new
things
are
happening
for
it
to
be
a
complete
erotic
fulfillment
.
Only
under
rare
circumstances
would
a
bride
experience
an
orgasm
during
her
first
intercourse
.
Both
man_and_wife
should
be
aware_of
the
fact
that
a
lack
of
climax
,
and
even
the
absence
of
the
anticipated
keen
pleasure
are
not
a
sign
that
the
wife
may
be
cold
or
frigid
.
If
the
early
approaches
are
wise
,
understanding
and
patient
,
the
satisfactions
of
marital
fulfillment
will
probably
be
discovered
before
the
marriage
is
much
older
.
Writing
in
a
large
volume
on
the
nude
in
painting
and
sculptures
,
titled
The
Nude
:
A
Study
in
Ideal
Form
,
Kenneth_Clark
declares
:
``
he
human_body
,
as
a
nucleus
,
is
rich_in
associations
.
It
is
ourselves
and
arouses
memories
of
all
the
things
we
wish
to
do
with
ourselves
''
.
Perhaps
this
is
a
clue
to
the
amazing
variety
and
power
of
reactions
,
attitudes
,
and
emotions
precipitated
by
the
nude
form
.
The
wide
divergence
of
reactions
is
clearly
illustrated
in
the
Kinsey
studies
in
human
sexuality
.
Differences
were_related
to
social
,
economic
,
and
educational
backgrounds
.
Whereas
persons
of
eighth
grade
education
or
less
were
more
apt
to
avoid
or
be
shocked
by
nudity
,
those
educated
beyond
the
eighth
grade
increasingly
welcomed
and
approved
nudity
in
sexual_relations
.
Such
understanding
helps
to
explain
why
one
matron
celebrating
thirty-five
years
of
married
life
could
declare
with
some
pride
that
her
husband
had
``
never
seen
her
entirely
naked
''
,
while
another
woman
,
boasting
an
equal
number
of
years
of
married
life
,
is
proud
of
having
``
shared
the
nudist
way_of_life
-
the
really
free
,
natural
nude
life
-
for
most_of
that
period
''
.
Attempts
at
censorship
always
involve
and
reveal
such
complex
and
multiple
individual
reactions
.
The
indignant
crusader
sees
the
nude
or
semi-nude
human
form
as
``
lewd
and
pornographic
,
a
threat
and
danger
''
to
all
the
young
,
or
good
,
or
religious
,
or
moral
persons
.
The
equally
ardent
proponent
of
freedom
from
any
kind_of
censorship
may
find
the
nude
human
form
the
``
natural
,
honest
,
free
expression
of
man
's
spirit
and
the
epitome
of
beauty
and
inspiration
''
.
One
is
always
a_little
surprised
to
bump
into
such
individual
distinctions
when
it
is
unexpected
.
I
still
recall
the
mild
shock
I
experienced
in
reading
material
of
an
enthusiastic
advocate
of
the
``
clean
,
healthful
,
free
way
of
natural
life
in
nudism
''
,
who
seemed
to
brave
much
misunderstanding
and
persecution
in
fine
spirit
.
