Buffeted
by
swirling
winds
,
the
little
green
biplane
struggled
northward
between
the
mountains
beyond
Northfield_Gulf
.
Wires
whined
as
a
cold
November
blast
rocked
the
silver
wings
,
but
the
engine
roar
was
reassuring
to
the
pilot
bundled
in_the_open
cockpit
.
He
peered
ahead
and
grinned
as
the
railroad_tracks
came
into
view
again
below
.
``
Good
old
iron
compass
''
!
he
thought
.
A
plume
of
smoke
rose
from
a
Central_Vermont
locomotive
which
idled
behind
a
string
of
gravel
cars
,
and
little
figures
that
were
workmen
labored
to
set
the
ruptured
roadbed
to
rights
.
The
girders
of
a
shattered
Dog_River
bridge
lay
strewn
for
half
a
mile
downstream
.
Vermont
's
main
railroad_line
was
prostrate
.
And
in
the
dark
days
after
the
Great_Flood
of
1927
-
the
worst
natural
disaster
in
the
state
's
history
-
the
little
plane
was
its
sole
replacement
in
carrying
the
United_States
mails
.
Rain
of
near
cloudburst
proportions
had
fallen
for
three
full
days
and
it
was
still
raining
on
the
morning
of
Friday
,
November
4
,
1927
,
when
officials
of
the
Post_Office_Department
's
Railway_Mail_Service
realized
that
their
distribution
system
for
Vermont
had
been
almost
totally
destroyed
overnight
.
Clerks
and
postmasters
shoveled
muck
out
of
their
offices
-
those
who
still
had
offices
-
and
wondered
how
to
move
the
mail
.
The
state
's
railroad
system
counted
miles
of
broken
bridges
and
missing
rights-of-way
:
it
would
obviously
remain
out
of
commission
for
weeks
.
And
once
medicine
,
food
,
clothing
and
shelter
had
been
provided
for
the
flood
's
victims
,
communications
and
the
mail
were
the
next
top
problems
.
From
Burlington
,
outgoing
mail
could
be
ferried
across
Lake_Champlain
to
the
railroad
at
Port_Kent
,
N._Y.
.
But
what
came_in
was
piling_up
.
The
nearest
undisrupted
end
of
track
from
Boston
was
at
Concord
,
N._H.
.
When
Governor_Al_Smith
offered
New_York
National_Guard
planes
to
fly
the
mail
in
and
out
of
the
state
,
it
seemed
a
likely
temporary
solution
,
easing
Burlington
's
bottleneck
and
that
at
Montpelier
too
.
The
question
was
``
Where
to
land
''
?
There
was
no
such
thing
as
an
airport
in
Vermont
.
Burlington
aviator
John_J._Burns
suggested
the
parade_ground
southwest
of
Fort_Ethan_Allen
,
and
soon
a
dozen
hastily-summoned
National_Guard
pilots
were
bringing
their
wide-winged
``
Jenny
''
and
DeHaviland
two-seaters
to
rest
on
the
frozen
sod
of
the
military
base
.
The
only
available
field
that
could
be
used
near
flood-ravaged
Montpelier
was
on
the
Towne
farm
off
upper
Main_Street
,
a
narrow
hillside
where
takeoffs
and
landings
could
be
safely
made
only
under
light
wind
conditions
.
Over
in
Barre
the
streets
had
been
deep
in
swirling
water
,
and
bridges
were
crumpled
and
gone
.
Anticipating
delivery
of
medicines
and
yeast
by
plane
,
Granite_City
citizens
formed
an
airfield
committee
and
with
the
aid
of
quarrymen
and
the
172
nd
Infantry
,
Vermont
National_Guard
,
laid_out
runways
on
Wilson
flat
,
high
on
Millstone_Hill
.
The
``
Barre_Aviation_Field
''
was
set_to
receive
its
first
aircraft
the
Sunday
following
the
flood
.
Though
the
makeshift
airports
were
ready
,
the
York_State_Guard
flyers
proved
unable
to
keep
any
kind_of
mail
schedule
.
They
had
courage
but
their
meager
training
consisted_of
weekend
hops
in
good_weather
,
in
and
out
of
established
airports
,
And
the
increasingly
cold_weather
soon
raised
hob
with
the
water
cooled
engines
of
their
World_War
1
,
planes
.
It
seemed
like
a
good
time
for
officials
to
use
a
recently-passed
law
empowering
the
post_office_department
to
contract
for
the
transport
of
first_class
mail
by
air
.
They
had_to
act
fast
,
for
letters
were
clogging
the
terminals
.
Down
in
Concord
,
New_Hampshire
,
was
a
flier
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
:
Robert_S._Fogg
,
a
native
New_Englander
,
had
been
a
World_War
1
,
flying
instructor
,
barnstormer
,
and
one
of
the
original
planners
of
the
Concord_Airport
.
Tall
,
wiry
,
dark-haired
Bob_Fogg
had
already
racked_up
one
historical
first
in
air_mail
history
.
Piloting
a
Curtiss_Navy_MF
flying_boat
off
Lake_Winnipesaukee
in
1925
,
he
had
inaugurated
the
original
Rural
Delivery
air
service
in
America
.
During
the
excitement
following
Lindbergh
's
flight
to
Paris
earlier
in
1927
,
dare
devil
aviators
overnight
became
legendary
heroes
.
In
Concord
,
Bob_Fogg
was
the_most
prominent
New_Hampshire
boy
with
wings
.
Public-spirited
backers
staked
him
to
a
brand-new
airplane
,
aimed
at
putting
their
city
and
state
on
the
flying
map
.
The
ship
was
a
Waco
biplane
,
one
of
the
first
two
of
its
type
to
be
fitted
with
the
air
cooled
,
225
HP_Wright
radial_engine
known
as
the
Whirlwind
.
A
trim
green
and
silver-painted
craft
only
22
-
1
2
feet
long
,
the
Waco
was
entered
to
compete
in
the
``
On-to-Spokane
''
Air_Derby
of
1927
.
As_a_matter_of_fact
,
Fogg
and
his
plane
did
n't
get
beyond
Pennsylvania
in
the
race
-
an
engine
oil
leak
forced
him
down
-
but
the
flying
service
and
school
he
started
subsequently
were
first_steps
in
paying_off
his
wry-faced
backers
.
So
with
all
this
experience
,
Bob_Fogg
was
a
natural
choice
to
receive
the
first
Emergency
Air_Mail
Star_Route
contract
.
His
work
began
just
six
days
after
the
flood
.
By
airline
from
Concord
to
Burlington
is
a
distance
of
about
150
miles
,
counting
a
slight
deviation
for
the
stop
at
either
Barre
or
Montpelier
.
The
first
few
days
Bob_Fogg
set
his
plane
down
on
Towne
field
back
of
the
State_House
when
the
wind
was
right
,
and
used
Wilson
flat
above
Barre
when
it
was
n't
.
Between
the
unsafe
Towne
field
and
the
long
roundabout
back
road
haul
that
was
necessary
to
gain
access
to
Wilson
flat
,
arrangements
at
the
state_capital
were
far
from
satisfactory
.
Each
time
in
,
the
unhappy
pilot
,
pushing
his
luck
,
begged
the
postal
officials
that
met
him
to
find
a
safer
landing_place
,
preferably
on
the
flat-topped
hills
across
the
Winooski_River
.
``
But
Fogg
''
,
they
countered
,
``
we
can
n't
get_over
there
.
And
besides
you
seem
to
make_it
all_right
here
''
.
It
took
a
tragedy
to
bring
things
to
a
head
.
After
a
week
of
precarious
uphill
landings
and
downwind
takeoffs
,
Fogg
one_day
looked
down
at
the
shattered
yellow
wreckage
of
an
Army
plane
strewn
across
snow-covered
Towne
field
.
Sent
to
Montpelier
by
Secretary_Herbert_Hoover
,
Red_Cross
Aide_Reuben_Sleight
had
been
killed
,
and
his
pilot
,
Lt._Franklin_Wolfe
,
badly
injured
.
With
the
field
a
blur
of
white
the
unfortunate
pilot
had
simply
flown
into
the
hillside
.
Faced
with
this
situation
,
Postmaster_Charles_F._McKenna
of
Montpelier
went
with
Fogg
on
a
Burlington
trip
,
and
together
they
scouted
the
terrain
on
the
heights
of
Berlin
.
A
long
flat
known
as
the
St._John
field
seemed
to
answer
their
purpose
,
and
since
the
Winooski
bridges
were
at_last
passable
,
they
decided
to
use
it
.
With
a
wary
eye
on
the
farmer
's
bull
,
Fred_Somers
of
Montpelier
and
Mr._St._John
marked
the
field
with
a
red
table
cloth
.
As
a
wind
direction
indicator
,
they
tied
a
cotton
rag
to
a
sapling
.
With
these
aids
,
and
a
pair
of
skiis
substituting
for
wheels
on
the
Waco
,
Bob_Fogg
made
the
first
landing
on
what
is
now
part
of
the
Barre-Montpelier_Airport
on
November
21
,
1927
.
Each
trip
saw
the
front
cockpit
filled
higher
with
mail_pouches
.
During
the
second
week
of
operations
,
Fogg
received
a
telegram
from
the
Post_Office_Department
,
asking
him
to
``
put_on
two
airplanes
and
make
two
flights
daily
,
plus
one
Sunday
trip
''
.
Since
Fogg
's
was
a
one-man
,
one-plane
flying
service
,
this
meant
that
he
would
have
to
do
both
trips
,
flying
alone
600
miles
a
day
,
under
sub-freezing
temperature
conditions
.
Over
the
weeks
,
America
's
first
Star_Route
Air_Mail
settled
into
a
routine
pattern
despite
the
vagaries
of
weather
and
the
lack
of
ground
facilities
and
aids
to
navigation
.
Each
morning
at
five
Fogg
crawled
out_of_bed
to
bundle
into
flying
togs
over
the
furnace
register
of
his
home
.
Always
troubled
by
poor
circulation
in
his
feet
,
he
experimented
with
various
combinations
of
socks
and
shoes
before
finally
adopting
old-style
felt
farmer
's
boots
with
his
sheepskin
flying
boots
pulled
over
them
.
A
sheep-lined
leather
flying
suit
,
plus
helmet
,
goggles
and
mittens
completed
his
attire
for
the
rigors
of
the
open
cockpit
.
The
airman
's
stock
answer
to
``
Were
n't
you
cold
''
?
became
``
Yes
,
the
first_half
hour
is
tough
,
but
by
then
I
'm
so
numb
I
do
n't
notice
it
''
!
As
daylight
began
to
show
through
the
frosty
windows
,
Fogg
would
place
a
call
to
William_A._Shaw
at
the
U._S.
Weather_Station
at
Northfield
,
Vermont
,
for
temperature
and
wind-velocity
readings
.
Shaw
could
also
give
the
flyer
a
pretty
good
idea
of
area
visibility
by
a
visual
check
of
the
mountains
to
be
seen
from
his
station
.
``
Ceilings
''
were
judged
by
comparison
with
known
mountain
heights
and
cloud
positions
.
Later_on
in
the
day
Fogg
could
get
a
better
weather
picture
from
the
Burlington
Weather_Bureau
supervised
by
Frank_E._Hartwell
.
Out
at
the
airport
each
morning
,
Fogg
's
skilled
mechanic
Caleb_Marston
would
have
the
Waco
warmed_up
and
running
in
the
drafty
hangar
.
(
He
'd
get
the
engine
oil
flowing
with
an
electric_heater
under
a
big
canvas
cover
.
)
Wishing
to
show
that
aviation
was
dependable
and
here
to
stay
,
Bob_Fogg
always
made
a
point
of
taking_off
each
morning
on
the
dot
of
seven
,
disregarding
rain
,
snow
and
sleet
in
true
postal
tradition
.
Concord
learned
to
set
its
clocks
by
the
rackety
bark
of
the
Whirlwind
's
exhaust
overhead
.
Sometimes
the
pilot
had_to
turn_back
if
fully
blocked
by
fog
,
but
85
%
of
his
trips
were
completed
.
Plane
radios
were
not_yet
available
,
and
once
in_the_air
,
Fogg
flew
his
ship
by
compass
,
a
good
memory
for
landmarks
as
seen
from
above
,
and
a
capacity
for
dead_reckoning
and
quick
computation
.
Often
,
threading
through
the
overcast
,
he
was
forced
to
fly
close_to
the
ground
by
a
low
ceiling
,
skimming
above
the
Winooski
or
the
White_River
along
the
line
of
the
broken
railroad
.
When
driving
rain
or
mist
socked
in
one
valley
,
Fogg
would
chandelle
up
and
over
to
reverse
course
and
try
another
one
,
ranging
from
the
Ottauquechee
up_to
Danville
in
search
of
safe
passage
through
the
mountain_passes
.
The
dependable
Wright
engine
was
never
stopped
on
these
trips
.
It
ticked
over
smoothly
,
idling
while
Fogg
exchanged
mails
with
the
armed
messenger
from
Burlington
at
Fort_Ethan_Allen
,
and
one
from
Montpelier
and
Barre
at
the
St._John
field
.
Sometimes
,
on
a
return
trip
,
the
aviator
would
``
go
upstairs
''
high
over
the
clouds
.
There
he
'd
take
a
compass
heading
,
figure
his
air
speed
,
and
deduce
that
in
a
certain
number
of
minutes
he
'd
be
over
the
broad
meadows
of
the
Merrimack_Valley
where
it
would
be
safe
to
let_down
through
the
overcast
and
see
the
ground
before
it
hit
him
.
Bob_Fogg
did
n't
have
today
's
advantages
of
Instrument_Flight
and
Ground_Control_Approach
systems
.
At
the
end
of
the
calculated
time
he
'd
nose
the
Waco
down
through
the
cloud_bank
and
hope
to
break_through
where
some
feature
of
the
winter
landscape
would
be
recognizable
.
Usually
back
in
Concord
by
noon
,
there
was
just
time
to
get
partially
thawed
out
,
refuel
,
and
grab
a_bit
of
Mrs._Fogg
's
hot
broth
before
starting
the
second
trip
.
Day_after_day
Fogg
shuttled
back_and_forth
on
his
one-man
air_mail
route
,
until
the
farmers
in
their
snowy
barnyards
and
the
road
repairmen
came
to
recognize
the
stubby
plane
as
their
link
with
the
rest
of
the
country
.
The
flyer
had
his
share
of
near-misses
.
At
Fort_Ethan_Allen
the
ever-present
wind
off
Lake_Champlain
could
readily
flip
a
puny
man-made
thing
like
an
airplane
if
the
pilot
miscalculated
.
Once
the
soldiers
from
the
barracks
had_to
hold
the
ship
from
blowing
away
while
Fogg
revved
the
engine
and
got
the
tail
up
.
At
a
nod
of
his
head
they
let_go
,
turning
to
cup
their
ears
against
the
icy
slipstream
.
Tracks
in
the
snow
showed
the
plane
was
airborne
in
less_than
a_hundred
feet
.
One
afternoon
during
a
cold
,
powdery
snowstorm
,
Fogg
took_off
for
Concord
from
the
St._John
field
.
