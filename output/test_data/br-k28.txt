Going
downstairs
with
the
tray
,
Winston
wished
he
could
have
given_in
to
Miss_Ada
,
but
he
knew
better
than
to
do
what
she
said
when
she
had
that
little
girl
look
.
There
were
times
it
was
n't
right
to
make
a
person
happy
,
like
the
times
she
came_in
the
kitchen
and
asked
for
a
peanut_butter
sandwich
.
``
You
know
we
do
n't
keep
peanut_butter
in_this
house
''
,
he
always
told
her
.
``
Why
,
Winston
''
,
she
'd
cry
,
``
I
just_now
saw
you
eating
it
out
of
the
jar
''
!
But
he
knew
how
important
it
was
for
her
to
keep
her
figure
.
In
the
kitchen
,
Leona
,
his
little
young
wife
,
was
reading
the
morning
paper
.
Her
legs
hung
down
long
and
thin
as
she
sat
on
the
high
stool
.
``
Here
''
,
Winston
said
gently
,
``
what
's
these
dishes
doing
not
washed
''
?
The
enormous
plates
which
had
held
Mr._Jack
's
four
fried_eggs
and
five
strips
of
bacon
were
still
stacked
in
the
sink
.
``
Leave
me
alone
''
,
Leona
said
.
``
Ca
n't
you
see
I'm
busy
''
?
She
looked
at
him
impudently
over
the
corner
of
the
paper
.
``
This
is
moving
day
''
,
Winston
reminded
her
,
``
and
I
bet
you
left
things
every_which_way
upstairs
,
your
clothes
all_over
the
floor
and
the
bed
not
made
.
Leona
''
!
His
eye
had
fastened
on
her
leg
;
bending
,
he
touched
her
knee
.
``
If
I
catch
you
one
more
time
down
here
without
stockings
''
-
She
twitched
her
leg
away
.
``
Fuss
,
fuss
,
old_man
''
.
She
had
an
alley_cat
's
manners
.
Winston
stacked
Miss_Ada
's
thin
pink
dishes
in
the
sink
.
Then
he
spread_out
the
last
list
on
the
counter
.
``
To
Be
Left
Behind
''
was
printed
at
the
top
in
Miss_Ada
;
fine
hand
.
Winston
took_out
a
pencil
,
admired
the
point
,
and
wrote
slowly
and
heavily
,
``
Clothes
Stand
''
.
Sighing
,
Leona
dropped
the
paper
and
stood_up
.
``
I
guess
I
better
get
ready
to
go
''
.
Winston
watched
her
fumbling
to
untie
her
apron
.
``
Here
''
.
Carefully
,
he
undid
the
bow
.
``
How_come
your
bows
is
always
cockeyed
''
?
She
turned
and
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
leave
here
,
Winston
''
.
``
Now
listen
to
that
''
.
He
drew_back
,
embarrassed
and
pleased
.
``
I
thought
you
was
sick_to_death
of_this
big
house
.
Said
you
wore
yourself
out
,
cleaning
all
these
empty
rooms
''
.
``
At_least
there
is
room
here
''
,
she
said
.
``
What
room
is
there
going_to
be
in
an
apartment
for
any
child
''
?
``
I
told
you
what
Miss_Ada
's
doctor
said
''
.
``
I
do
n't
mean
Miss_Ada
!
What
you
think
I
care
about
that
?
I
mean
our
children
''
.
She
sounded
as
though
they
already
existed
.
In_spite
of
the
hundred
things
he
had
on
his
mind
,
Winston
went
and
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
.
``
We
've
got
plenty
of
time
to
think_about
that
.
All
the
time
in_the_world
.
We
've
only
been
married
four
years
,
January
''
.
``
Four
years
''
!
she
wailed
.
``
That
's
a
long_time
,
waiting
''
.
``
How
many
times
have
I
told
you
''
-
he
began
,
and
was
almost
glad
when
she
cut
him
off
-
``
Too
many
times
''
!
-
and
flounced
to
the
sink
,
where
she
began
noisily
to
wash
her
hands
.
Too
many
times
was
the
truth
of_it
,
Winston
thought
.
He
hardly
believed
his
reason
himself
any_more
.
Although
it
had
seemed
a
good
reason
,
to_begin_with
:
no
couple
could
afford
to
have
children
.
``
How
you
going
to
work
with
a
child
hanging_on
you
''
?
he
asked
Leona
.
``
You
want
to
keep
this
job
,
do
n't
you
''
?
He
doubted
whether
she
heard
him
,
over
the
running
water
.
He
sat
for_a_while
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
watching
the
bend
of
her
back
as
she
gathered_up
her
things
-
a
comb
,
a
bottle
of
aspirin
-
to
take
upstairs
and
pack
.
She
made
him
sad
some
days
,
and
he
was
never
sure
why
;
it
was
something
to
do
with
her
back
,
the
thinness
of_it
,
and
the
quick
,
jerky
way
she
bent
.
She
was
too
young
,
that
was
all
;
too
young
and
thin
and
straight
.
``
Winston
''
!
It
was
Mr._Jack
,
bellowing
out
in
the
hall
.
Winston
hurried
through
the
swinging_door
.
``
I
've
been
bursting
my
lungs
for
you
''
,
Mr._Jack
complained
.
He
was
standing
in_front_of
the
mirror
,
tightening
his
tie
.
He
had_on
his
gray
tweed
overcoat
and
his
city
hat
,
and
his
brief_case
lay
on
the
bench
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
think
you
've
been
doing
about
my
clothes
''
,
he
said
.
``
This
coat
looks_like
a
rag
heap
''
.
There
were
a_few
blades
of
lint
on
the
shoulder
.
Winston
took
the
clothesbrush
out
of
the
closet
and
went
to
work
.
He
gave
Mr._Jack
a
real
going_over
;
he
brushed
his
shoulders
and
his
back
and
his
collar
with
long
,
firm
strokes
.
``
Hey
''
!
Mr._Jack
cried
when
the
brush
tipped
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
.
Winston
apologized
and
quickly
set
the
hat
right
.
Then
he
stood_back
to
look
at
Mr._Jack
,
who
was
pulling
on
his
pigskin
gloves
.
Winston
enjoyed
seeing
him
start_out
;
he
wore
his
clothes
with
style
.
When
he
was
going_to
town
,
nothing
was
good
enough
-
he
had
cursed
at
Winston
once
for
leaving
a
fleck
of
polish
on
his
shoelace
.
At
home
,
he
would
n't
even
wash
his
hands
for
supper
,
and
he
wandered
around
the
yard
in
a
pair
of
sweaty
old
corduroys
.
The
velvet
smoking_jackets
,
pearl
gray
,
wine
,
and
blue
,
which
Miss_Ada
had
bought
him
hung
brushed
and
unworn
in
the
closet
.
``
Good-by
,
Winston
''
,
Mr._Jack
said
,
giving
a
final
set
to
his
hat
.
``
Look_out
for
those
movers
''
!
Winston
watched
him
hurry
down
the
drive
to
his
car
;
a
handsome
,
fine-looking
man
it
made
him
proud
to
see
.
After
Mr._Jack
drove
away
,
Winston
went_on
looking
out
the
window
.
He
noticed
a
speck
of
dirt
on
the
sill
and
swiped
at
it
with
his
finger
.
Then
he
looked
at
his
finger
,
at
the
wrinkled
,
heavy
knuckle
and
the
thick
nail
he
used
like
a
knife
to
pry
up
,
slit
,
and
open
.
For_the_first_time
,
he
let
himself
be
sad
about
the
move
.
That
house
was
ten
years
off
his
life
.
Each
brass
handle
and
hinge
shone
for
his
reward
,
and
he
knew
how
to
get_at
the
dust
in
the
china
flowers
and
how
to
take_down
the
long
glass
drops
which
hung
from
the
chandelier
.
He
knew
the
house
like
a
blind_man
,
through
his
fingers
,
and
he
did
not
like
to
think_of
all
the
time
and
rags
and
polishes
he
had
spent
on
keeping
it
up
.
Ten
years
ago
,
he
had
come
to
the
house
to
be
interviewed
.
The
tulips
and
the
big
pink
peonies
had
been
blooming
along
the
drive
,
and
he
had
walked
up
from
the
bus
almost
singing
.
Miss_Ada
had
been
out
back
,
in
a
straw_hat
,
planting
flowers
.
She
had
talked
to
him
right
there
,
with
the
hot
sun
in
his
face
,
which
made
him
sweat
and
feel
ashamed
.
Winston
had
been
surprised
at
her
for
that
.
Still
,
he
had
liked
the
way
she
had
looked
,
in
a
fresh
,
neat
cotton
dress
-
citron
yellow
,
if
he
remembered
.
She
had
had
a
dignity
about
her
,
even
barefoot
and
almost
too
tan
.
Since
then
,
the
flowers
she
had
planted
had
spread
all_over
the
hill
.
Already
the
jonquils
were
blooming
in
a
flock
by
the
front
gate
,
and
the
periwinkles
were
coming_on
,
blue
by
the
porch
steps
.
In
a
week
the
hyacinths
would
spike_out
.
And
the
dogwood
in
early
May
,
for
Miss_Ada
's
alfresco
party
;
and
after
that
the
Japanese_cherries
.
Now
the
yard
looked
wet
and
bald
,
the
trees
bare
under
their
buds
,
but
in
a
while
Miss_Ada
's
flowers
would
bloom
like
a
marching
parade
.
She
had
dug
a
hole
for
each
bulb
,
each
tree
wore
a
tag
with
her
writing
on_it
;
where
would
she
go
for
her
gardening
now
?
Somehow
Winston
did
n't
think
she
'd
take_to
window_boxes
.
Sighing
,
he
hurried
to
the
living_room
.
He
had
a_thousand
things
to
see
to
.
Still
,
he
could
n't
help
thinking
,
we
're
all
getting
old
,
getting
small
;
the
snail
is
pulling_in
her
horns
.
In
the
living_room
,
Miss_Ada
was
standing
by
the
window
with
a
sheaf
of
lists
in
her
hand
.
She
was
looking
out
at
the
garden
.
``
Winston
''
,
she
said
,
``
get
the
basket
for
the
breakables
''
.
Winston
had
the
big
straw
basket
ready
in
the
hall
.
He
brought
it
in
and
put
it
down
beside
her
.
Miss_Ada
was
looking
fine
;
she
had_on
her
Easter
suit
,
blue
,
with
lavender
binding
.
Halfway
across
the
house
,
he
could
have
smelled
her
morning
perfume
.
It
hung_in
all
her
day
clothes
,
sweet
and
strong
;
sometimes
when
he
was
pressing
,
Winston
raised
her
dresses
to
his
face
.
Frowning
,
Miss_Ada
studied
the
list
.
``
Well
,
let
's
see
.
The
china
lemon_tree
.
The
alabaster
cockatoo
''
.
Winston
followed
her
around
the
room
,
collecting
the
small
frail
objects
(
Christmas
,
birthday
,
and
anniversary
)
and
wrapping
them
in
tissue_paper
.
Neither
of
them
trusted
the
movers
.
When
they
came
to
Mr._Jack
's
photograph
,
twenty
by
twelve
inches
in
a
curly
silver
frame
,
Miss_Ada
said
,
``
By_rights
I
ought
to
leave
that
,
seeing
he
won
n't
take
my
clotheshorse
''
.
She
smiled
at
Winston
,
and
he
saw
the
hateful
hard
glitter
in
her
eyes
.
He
picked_up
the
photograph
and
began
to
wrap
it
.
``
At_least
you
could
leave
it
for
the
movers
''
,
Miss_Ada
said
.
``
What
possessed
you
to
tell
me
a
clotheshorse
would
be
a
good
idea
''
?
Winston
folded
the
tissue_paper
carefully
.
``
He
's
used
it
every_day
;
every
morning
,
I
lay_out
his
clothes
on_it
''
.
``
Well
,
that
's
over
now
.
And
it
was
his
main
present
!
Leave
that
fool
picture
out
''
,
she
added
sharply
.
Winston
laid
it
in
the
basket
.
``
Mr._Jack
sets
store
by
that
''
.
``
Really
,
Winston
.
It
was
meant
to
be
my
present
''
.
But
she
went_on
down
the
list
.
Winston
was
relieved
;
those
presents
had
been
on
his
mind
.
He
had
only
agreed
with
Miss_Ada
about
getting
the
valet
,
but
he
had
actually
suggested
the
photograph
to
Mr._Jack
.
``
You
know
what
she
likes
,
Winston
''
,
he
had
said
wearily
,
one
evening
in
November
when
Winston
was
pulling_off
his
overshoes
.
``
Tell
me
what
to
get
her
for
Christmas
''
.
``
She
's
been
talking_about
a
picture
''
,
Winston
had
told
him
.
``
Picture
!
You
mean
picture
of
me
''
?
But
Winston
had
persuaded
him
.
On
Christmas
night
,
they
had
had
a
disagreement
about
it
.
Winston
had
heard
because
he
was
setting_up
the
liquor
tray
in
the
next
room
.
Through
the
door
,
he
had
seen
Mr._Jack
walking_around
,
waiting
for
Miss_Ada
.
Finally
she
had
come_down
;
Winston
had
heard
her
shaking
out
the
skirt
of
her
new
pink
silk
hostess
gown
.
``
How
do
you
like
it
''
?
she
had
asked
.
Mr._Jack
had
said
,
``
You
look
about
fifteen
years
old
''
.
``
Is
that
a
compliment
''
?
``
I
do
n't
know
''
.
He
had
stood
at
a_little
distance
,
studying
her
,
as
though
he
would
walk_around
next
and
look
at
the
back
of
her
head
.
``
Lovie
,
you
make
me
feel
naked
''
.
Miss_Ada
had
giggled
,
and
she
went
sweeping
and
rustling
to
the
couch
and
sank
down
.
``
You
look
like
that
picture
I
have
at
the
office
''
,
Mr._Jack
had
started
.
``
Not
a
line
,
not
a
wrinkle
.
I
look_like
an
old_man
,
compared
''
,
and
he
had
picked_up
his
photograph
with
the
red
Christmas
bow
still
on_it
.
``
Look
,
an
old_man
.
Will
you
wear
pink
when
you
're
sixty
''
?
``
Darling
,
I
love
that
photograph
.
I'm
going_to
put
it
on
my
dresser
''
.
``
I
guess
it
's
children
make
a
woman
old
.
A
man
gets
old
anyhow
''
.
After
a
minute
he
went_on
,
``
People
must
think
the
curse
is
on
me
,
seeing
you
fresh
as
an
apple
and
me
old
and
gray
''
.
``
I
'll
give
you
a
medical
certificate
,
framed
,
if
you
like
''
,
Miss_Ada
had
said
.
``
No
.
All
I
want
is
a
picture
-
with
a_few
lines
.
Make
the
man
put
them
in
if
he
has
to
''
.
After
that
they
had
sat
for
five
minutes
without
saying
a
word
.
Then
Miss_Ada
had
stood_up
,
rustling
and
rustling
,
and
gone
upstairs
.
