Mr._Speaker
,
for
several
years
now
the
commuter
railroads
serving
our
large
metropolitan
areas
have
found
it
increasingly
difficult
to
render
the
kind
of
service
our
expanding
population
wants
and
is
entitled
to
have
.
The
causes
of
the
decline
of
the
commuter
railroads
are
many
and
complex
-
high
taxes
,
losses
of
revenue
to
Government
subsidized
highway
and
air
carriers
,
to
name
but
two
.
And
the
solutions
to
the
problems
of
the
commuter
lines
have
been
equally
varied
,
ranging
all_the_way
from
Government
ownership
to
complete
discontinuance
of
this
important
service
.
There
have
been
a
number
of
sound
plans
proposed
.
But
none
of
these
has
been
implemented
.
Instead
we
have
stood
idly
by
,
watched
our
commuter
railroad
service
decline
,
and
have
failed
to
offer
a
helping_hand
.
Though
the
number
of
people
flowing
in
and
out
of
our
metropolitan
areas
each_day
has
increased
tremendously
since
World_War_2
,
,
total
annual
rail
commutation
dropped
124
million
from
1947
to
1957
.
Nowhere
has
this
decline
been
more
painfully
evident
than
in
the
New_York_City
area
.
Here
the
New_York_Central_Railroad
,
one
of
the
Nation
's
most
important
carriers
,
has
alone
lost
47.6
percent
of
its
passengers
since
1949
.
At
this
time
of
crisis
in
our
Nation
's
commuter
railroads
,
a
new
threat
to
the
continued
operations
of
the
New_York_Central
has
appeared
in
the
form
of
the
Chesapeake_+_Ohio_Railroad
's
proposal
for
control
of
the
Baltimore_+_Ohio_railroads
.
The
New_York_Central
has
pointed_out
that
this
control
,
if
approved
by
the
Interstate_Commerce_Commission
,
would
give
the
combined
C.+O.
-
B.+O._Railroad
a
total
of
185
points
served
in_common
with
the
New_York_Central
.
Not_only
is
this
kind
of
duplication
wasteful
,
but
it
gives
the
combined
system
the
ability
to
take
freight
traffic
away
from
the
New_York_Central
and
other
railroads
serving
the
area
.
The
New_York_Central
notes
:
``
The
freight
traffic
most
susceptible
to
raiding
by
the
C.
+_O._-_B.
+_O.
provides
the
backbone
of
Central
's
revenues
.
These
revenues
make
it
possible
to
provide
essential
freight
and
passenger
service
over
the
entire
New_York_Central
system
as_well_as
the
New_York
area
commuter
and
terminal
freight
services
.
If
these
services
are
to
be
maintained
,
the
New_York_Central
must
have
the
revenues
to
make
them
possible
''
.
The
New_York_Central
today
handles
60
percent
of
all
southbound
commuter_traffic
coming
into
New_York_City
.
This
is
a
$
14
million
operation
involving
3500
employees
who
work_on
commuter_traffic
exclusively
.
A
blow
to
this
phase
of
the
Central
's
operations
would
have
serious
economic
consequences
not_only
to
the
railroad
itself
,
but
to
the
40000
people
per
day
who
are
provided
with
efficient
,
reasonably
priced
transportation
in_and_out
of
the
city
.
``
There
is
a
workable
alternative
to
this
potentially
dangerous
and
harmful
C.
+
O.
-
B.
+
O.
merger
scheme
''
-
The
Central
has
pointed_out
.
``
The
logic
of
creating
a
strong
,
balanced
,
competitive
two
system
railroad
service
in
the
East
is
so
obvious
that
B._+_O.
was
publicly
committed
to
the
approach
outlined
here
.
Detailed
studies
of
the
plan
were
well
underway
.
Though
far
from
completion
,
these
studies
indicated
beyond
a
doubt
that
savings
would
result
which
would
be
of
unprecedented
benefit
to
the
railroads
concerned
,
their
investors
,
their
customers
,
their
users
,
and
to
the
public
at_large
.
Then
,
abandoning
the
studies
in
the
face
of
their
promising
outlook
for
all
concerned
,
B.
+
O.
entered
on-again-off-again
negotiations
with
C.
+
O.
which
resulted
in
the
present
situation
.
In
the
light
of
the
facts
at_hand
,
however
,
New_York_Central
intends
to
pursue
the
objective
of
helping
to
create
a
healthy
two
system
eastern
railroad
structure
in
the
public
interest
``
.
The
Interstate_Commerce_Commission
will
commence
its
deliberations
on
the
proposed
C._+_O._-_B.
+
O.
merger
on
June
18
.
Obviously
,
the
Interstate_Commerce_Commission
will
not
force
the
New_York_Central
to
further
curtail
its
commuter
operations
by
giving
undue
competitive
advantages
to
the
lines
that
wish
to
merge
.
However
,
there
is
a
more
profound
consideration
to
this
proposed
merger
than
profit
and
loss
.
That_is
,
will
it
serve
the
long-range
public
interest
?
For
the
past
40
years
Congress
has
advocated
a
carefully
planned
,
balanced
and
competitive
railway_system
.
We
must
ask
ourselves
which
of
the
two
alternatives
will
help
the
commuter
-
the
two-way
B.
+_O._-_C._+
O.
merger
,
or
the
three_way
New_York_Central
B._+_O._-_C._+_O.
merger
.
Which
will
serve
not_only
the
best
interest
of
the
stockholders
,
but
the
interests
of
all
the
traveling
public
?
Mr._Speaker
,
I
rise
today
to
pay
tribute
to
a
great
newspaper
,
the
New_York_Times
,
on
the
occasion
of
a
major
change
in
its
top_executive
command
.
Arthur_Hays_Sulzberger
has
been
a
distinguished
publisher
of
this
distinguished
newspaper
and
it
is
fitting
that
we
take
due
notice
of
his
major
contribution
to
American
journalism
on
the
occasion
of
his
retirement
.
I
am
pleased
to
note
that
Mr._Sulzberger
will
continue
to
serve
as
chairman_of_the_board
of
the
New_York_Times
.
Mr._Sulzberger
's
successor
as
publisher
is
Mr._Orvil_E._Dryfoos
,
who
is
president
of
the
New_York_Times_Co.
,
and
who
has
been
with
the
Times
since
1942
.
Mr._Dryfoos
'
outstanding
career
as
a
journalist
guarantees
that
the
high
standards
which
have
made
the
Times
one
of
the
world
's
great
newspapers
will
be
maintained
.
I
am
also
pleased
to
note
that
Mr._John_B._Oakes
,
a
member
of
the
Times
staff
since
1946
,
has
been
appointed
as
editorial
page
editor
.
Mr._Oakes
succeeds
Charles_Merz
,
editor
since
1938
,
who
now
becomes
editor
emeritus
.
I
should_like
at
this
time
,
Mr._Speaker
,
to
pay
warm
tribute
to
Arthur_Hays_Sulzberger
and
Charles_Merz
on
the
occasion
of
their
retirement
from
distinguished
careers
in
American
journalism
.
My
heartiest
congratulations
go
to
their
successors
,
Orvil_E._Dryfoos
and
John_B._Oakes
,
who
can
be
counted_upon
to
sustain
the
illustrious
tradition
of
the
New_York_Times
.
The
people
of
the
17_th
District
of
New_York
,
and
I
as
their
Representative
in
Congress
,
take
great
pride
in
the
New_York_Times
as
one
of
the
great
and
authoritative
newspapers
of
the
world
.
Mr._Speaker
,
in
my
latest
newsletter
to
my
constituents
I
urged
the
imposition
of
a
naval_blockade
of
Cuba
as
the
only
effective
method
of
preventing
continued
Soviet
armaments
from
coming
into
the
Western_Hemisphere
in
violation
of
the
Monroe_Doctrine
.
Yesterday
,
I
had
the
privilege
of
reading
a
thoughtful
article
in
the
U._S._News_+_World_Report
of
May
8
which
discussed
this
type
of
action
in
more
detail
,
including
both
its
advantages
and
its
disadvantages
.
Under
leave
to
extend
my
remarks
,
I
include
the
relevant
portion
of
my
newsletter
,
together
with
the
text
of
the
article
from
the
U._S._News_+_World_Report
:
``
Cuban
S._S._R.
:
Whatever
may
have
been
the
setbacks
resulting
from
the
unsuccessful
attempt
of
the
Cuban
rebels
to
establish
a
beachhead
on
the
Castro
held
mainland
last
week
,
there
was
at_least
one
positive
benefit
,
and
that
was
the
clear-cut
revelation
to
the
whole
world
of
the
complete
conversion
of
Cuba
into
a
Russian
dominated
military
base
.
In_fact
,
one
of
the
major
reasons
for
the
failure
of
the
ill-starred
expedition
appears
to
have
been
a
lack
of
full
information
on
the
extent
to
which
Cuba
has
been
getting
this
Russian
military
equipment
.
Somehow
,
the
pictures
and
stories
of
Soviet
T-34
tanks
on
Cuban
beaches
and
Russian
Mig
jet
fighters
strafing
rebel
troops
has
brought_home
to
all_of
us
the
stark
,
blunt
truth
of
what
it
means
to
have
a
Russian
military
base
90
miles
away
from
home
.
Russian
tanks
and
planes
in
Cuba
jeopardize
the
security
of
the
United_States
,
violate
the
Monroe_Doctrine
,
and
threaten
the
security
of
every
other
Latin_American
republic
.
Once
the
full
extent
of_this
Russian
military
penetration
of
Cuba
was
clear
,
President_Kennedy
announced
we
would
take
whatever
action
was
appropriate
to
prevent
this
,
even
if
we
had
to
go
it
alone
.
But
the
Latin_American
republics
who
have
been
rather
inclined
to
drag
their
feet
on
taking
action
against
Castro
also
reacted
swiftly
last
week
by
finally
throwing
Cuba
off
the
Inter-American_Defense_Board
.
For
years
the
United_States
had
been
trying
to
get
these
countries
to
exclude
Castro
's
representative
from
secret
military
talks
.
But
it
took
the
pictures
of
the
Migs
and
the
T-34
tanks
to
do
the
job
.
There
is
a
new
atmosphere
of
urgency
in
Washington
this
week
.
You
can
see
it
,
for_example
,
in
the
extensive
efforts
President_Kennedy
has
made
to
enlist
solid
bipartisan
support
for
his
actions
toward
both
Cuba
and
Laos
;
efforts
,
as
I
see
it
,
which
are
being
directed
,
by_the_way
,
toward
support
for
future
actions
,
not
for
those
already
past
.
What
the
next
move
will
be
only
time
,
of_course
,
will
tell
.
Personally
,
I
think
we
ought
to
set_up
an
immediate
naval_blockade
of
Cuba
.
We
simply
can
n't
tolerate
further
Russian
weapons
,
including
the
possibility
of
long-range
nuclear
missiles
,
being
located
in
Cuba
.
Obviously
,
we
can
n't
stop
them
from
coming_in
,
however
,
just
by
talk
.
A
naval_blockade
would
be
thoroughly
in
line
with
the
Monroe_Doctrine
,
would
be
a
relatively
simple
operation
to
carry_out
,
and
would
bring
an
abrupt
end
to
Soviet
penetration
of
our
hemisphere
``
.
Look_at
Castro
now
-
cockier
than
ever
with
arms
and
agents
to
threaten
the_Americas
.
How
can
the
United_States
act
?
Blockade
is
one
answer
offered
by
experts
.
In
it
they
see
a
way
to
isolate
Cuba
,
stop
infiltration
,
maybe
finish
Castro
,
too
.
This
is
the
question
now
facing
President_Kennedy
:
How
to
put
a
stop
to
the
Soviet
buildup
in
Cuba
and
to
Communist
infiltration
of
this
hemisphere
?
On
April
25
,
the
White_House
reported
that
a
total
embargo
of
remaining
U._S.
trade
with
Cuba
was
being
considered
.
Its
aim
:
To
undermine
further
Cuba
's
economy
.
weaken
Castro
.
Another
strategy
-
bolder
and
tougher
-
was
also
attracting
notice
in
Washington
:
a
naval
and
air
blockade
to
cut
Cuba
off
from
the
world
,
destroy
Castro
.
Blockade
,
in
the
view
of
military
and
civilian
experts
,
could
restore
teeth
to
the
Monroe_Doctrine
.
It
could
halt
a
flood
of
Communist
arms
and
strategic
supplies
now
reaching
Castro
.
It
could
stop
Cuban
re
export
of
guns
and
propaganda
materials
to
South_America
.
It
would
be
the
most
severe
reprisal
,
short_of
declared
war
,
that
the
United_States
could
invoke
against
Castro
.
It
is
the
strategy
of
blockade
,
therefore
,
that
is
suddenly
at
the
center
of
attention
of
administration
officials
,
Members
of
Congress
,
officers
in
the
Pentagon
.
As
a
possible
course
of
action
,
it
also
is
the
center
of
debate
and
is
raising
many
questions
.
Among
these
questions
:
Military
experts
say
a
tight
naval_blockade
off
Cuban
ports
and
at
the
approaches
to
Cuban
waters
would
require
two
naval
task_forces
,
each
built
around
an
aircraft_carrier
with
a
complement
of
about
100
planes
and
several
destroyers
.
The
Navy
,
on
April
25
,
announced
it
is
bringing_back
the
carrier
Shangri-La
from
the
Mediterranean
,
increasing
to
four
the
number
of
attack_carriers
in
the
vicinity
of
Cuba
.
More
than
36
other
big
Navy
ships
are
no
less_than
a
day
's
sailing
time
away
.
To
round_out
the
blockading
force
,
submarines
would
be
needed
-
to
locate
,
identify
and
track
approaching
vessels
.
Land
based
radar
would
help
with
this
task
.
So
would
radar
picket_ships
.
A
squadron
of
Navy
jets
and
another
of
long-range
patrol
planes
would
add
support
to
the
carrier
task_forces
.
Three
requirements
go_with
a
blockade
:
It
must
be
proclaimed
;
the
blockading
force
must
be
powerful
enough
to
enforce
it
;
and
it
must
be
enforced
without
discrimination
.
Once
these
conditions
of
international_law
are
met
,
countries
that
try
to
run
to
blockade
do
so
at
their
own
risk
.
Blockade
runners
can
be
stopped
-
by
gunfire
,
if
necessary
-
searched
and
held
,
at_least
temporarily
.
They
could
be
sent
to
U._S.
ports
for
rulings
whether
cargo
should
be
confiscated
.
Plenty
,
say
the
experts
.
In
a
broad
sense
,
it
would
reaffirm
the
Monroe_Doctrine
by
opposing
Communist
interference
in
the
Western_Hemisphere
.
It
could
,
by
avoiding
direct
intervention
,
provide
a
short-of
war
strategy
to
meet
short-of
war
infiltration
.
Primary
target
would
be
shipments
of
tanks
,
guns
,
aviation
gasoline
and
ammunition
coming
from
Russia
and
Czechoslovakia
.
Shipments
of
arms
from
Western
countries
could
similarly
be
seized
as
contraband
.
In
a
total
blockade
,
action
could
also
be
taken
against
ships
bringing_in
chemicals
,
oils
,
textiles
,
and
even
foodstuffs
.
At_times
,
three
ships
a
day
from
the
Soviet
bloc
are
unloading
in
Cuban
ports
.
