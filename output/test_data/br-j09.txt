A
variety
of
techniques
have
been
directed
toward
the
isolation
and
study
of
blood_group
antibodies
.
These
include
low-temperature
ethanol
(
Cohn
)
fractionation
,
electrophoresis
,
ultracentrifugation
and
column_chromatography
on
ion_exchange
celluloses
.
Modifications
of
the
last
technique
have
been
applied
by
several
groups
of
investigators
.
Abelson
and
Rawson
,
using
a
stepwise
elution
scheme
,
fractionated
whole
sera
containing
ABO
and
Rh_antibodies
on
diethylaminoethyl
DEAE_cellulose
and
carboxymethyl_cellulose
.
Speer
and
coworkers
,
in
a
similar
study
of
blood_group
antibodies
of
whole
sera
,
used
a
series
of
gradients
for
elution
from
DEAE-cellulose
.
Fahey
and
Morrison
used
a
single
,
continuous
gradient
at
constant
pH
for
the
fractionation
of
anti
-
A
and
anti
-
B
agglutinins
from
preisolated
|
g-globulin
samples
.
In
the
present
work
whole
sera
have
been
fractionated
by
chromatography
on
DEAE-cellulose
using
single
gradients
similar
to
those
described
by
Sober
and
Peterson
,
and
certain
chemical
and
serological
properties
of
the
fractions
containing
antibodies
of
the
ABO
and
Rh
systems
have
been
described
.
Serum
samples
were
obtained
from
normal
group
A
,
group
B
and
group
O
donors
.
Three
of
the
anti
-
Rh
sera
used
were
taken
from
recently
sensitized
individuals
.
One
contained
complete
antibody
and
had
a
titer
of
1
:
512
in
saline
.
The
second
contained
incomplete
antibody
and
showed
titers
of
1
:
256
in
albumin
and
1
:
2048
by
the
indirect_Coombs_test
.
The
third
,
containing
the
mixed
type
of
complete
and
incomplete
antibodies
,
had
titers
of
1
:
256
in
saline
,
1
:
512
in
albumin
and
1
:
1024
by
the
indirect_Coombs_test
.
In_addition
one
serum
was
obtained
from
a
donor
(
R._E.
.
)
who
had
been
sensitized
6
years
previously
.
This
serum
exhibited
titers
of
1
:
16
in
albumin
and
1
:
256
by
the
indirect_Coombs_test
.
These
antibody
titers
were
determined
by
reaction
with
homozygous
*
*
f
red_cells
.
Anti
-
A
and
anti
-
B
activities
were
determined
in
fractions
from
the
sera
of
group
A
,
group
B
or
group
O
donors
by
the
following
tube
agglutination
methods
.
One
drop
of
each
sample
was
added
to
one
drop
of
a
2
%
suspension
of
group
*
*
f
or
group
B
red_cells
in
a
small
*
*
f
test_tube
.
In
several
instances
group
O
cells
were
also
used
as
controls
.
The
red_cells
were
used
within
2
days
after
donation
and
were
washed
with
large
amounts
of
saline
before
use
.
The
mixtures
of
sample
plus
cell
suspension
were
allowed
to
stand
at
room_temperature
for
1
hr
.
the
tubes
were
then
centrifuged
at
1000
rpm
for
1
min
and
examined
macroscopically
for
agglutination
.
For
the
albumin
method
,
equal
volumes
of
30
%
bovine
albumin
,
sample
and
2
%
cells
suspended
in
saline
were
allowed
to
stand
at
room_temperature
for
1
hr
and
then
were
centrifuged
at
1000
rpm
for
1
min
.
All
samples
were
tested
by
both
the
saline
and
albumin
methods
.
The
activities
of
fractions
of
sera
containing
Rh_antibodies
were
tested
by
the
saline
,
albumin
and
indirect_Coombs
techniques
.
Homozygous
and
heterozygous
*
*
f
cells
,
*
*
f
and
homozygous
and
heterozygous
*
*
f
cells
were
used
to
test
each
sample
;
however
,
in
the
interest
of
clarity
and
conciseness
only
the
results
obtained
with
homozygous
*
*
f
and
homozygous
*
*
f
cells
will
be
presented
here
.
The
saline
and
albumin
tests
were
performed
as
described
for
the
ABO
samples
except
that
the
mixture
was
incubated
for
1
hr
at
37
`
C
before
centrifugation
.
The
saline
tubes
were
saved
and
used
for
the
indirect_Coombs_test
in
the
following
manner
.
The
cells
were
washed
three
times
with
saline
,
anti
human
serum
was
added
,
the
cells
were
resuspended
,
and
the
mixture
was
centrifuged
at
1000
rpm
for
1
min
and
examined
for
agglutination
.
The
anti
human
sera
used
were
prepared
by
injecting
whole
human
serum
into
rabbits
.
Those
antisera
shown
by
immunoelectrophoresis
to
be
of
the
``
broad
spectrum
''
type
were
selected
for
used
in
the
present
study
.
The
red_cells
for
the
Rh_antibody
tests
were
used
within
3
days
after
drawing
except
for
the
*
*
f
cells
,
which
had
been
glycerolized
and
stored
at
-
20
`
C
for
approximately
1
year
.
These
cells
were
thawed
at
37
`
C
for
30
min
and
were
deglycerolized
by
alternately
centrifuging
and
mixing
with
descending
concentrations
of
glycerol
solutions
(
20
,
18
,
10
,
8
,
4
and
2
%
)
.
The
cells
were
then
washed
three
times
with
saline
and
resuspended
to
2
%
in
saline
.
Blood
samples
were
allowed
to
clot
at
room_temperature
for
3
hr
,
centrifuged
and
the
serum
was
removed
.
The
serum
was
measured
volumetrically
and
subsequently
dialyzed
in
the
cold
for
at_least
24
hr
against
three
to
four
changes
,
approximately
750
ml
each
,
of
``
starting_buffer
''
.
This
buffer
,
pH
8.6
,
was
0.005
M
in
*
*
f
and
0.039
M
in
tris
(
hydroxymethyl
)
-
aminomethane
(
Tris
)
.
After
dialysis
the
sample
was
centrifuged
and
the
supernatant
placed
on
a
*
*
f
cm
column
of
DEAE-cellulose
equilibrated
with
starting_buffer
.
The
DEAE-cellulose
,
containing
0.78
mEq
of
N
/
g
,
was
prepared
in
our
laboratory
by
the
method
of
Peterson
and
Sober
(
7
)
from
powdered
cellulose
,
100
-
230
mesh
.
The
small
amount
of
insoluble
material
which
precipitated
during
dialysis
was
suspended
in
approximately
5
ml
of
starting_buffer
,
centrifuged
,
resuspended
in
2.5
ml
of
isotonic
saline
and
tested
for
antibody
activity
.
The
chromatography
was
done
at
6
`
C
using
gradient
elution
,
essentially
according_to
Sober
and
Peterson
.
The
deep
concave
gradient
employed
(
fig.
2
)
was
obtained
with
a
nine
chambered
gradient
elution
device
(
``
Varigrad
''
,
reference
(
8
)
)
and
has
been
described
elsewhere
.
the
other
,
a
shallow
concave
gradient
(
Fig.
1
)
,
was
produced
with
a
so-called
``
cone
sphere
''
apparatus
,
the
``
cone
''
being
a
2
-
liter
Erlenmeyer_flask
and
the
``
sphere
,
''
a
2
-
liter
round-bottom
flask
.
Each
initially
contained
1700
ml
of
buffer
;
in
the
sphere
was
starting
buffer
and
in
the
cone
was
final
buffer
,
0.50
M
in
both
*
*
f
and
Tris
,
pH
4.1
.
A
flow_rate
of
72
*
*
f
was
used
and
12
ml
fractions
were
collected
.
Approximately
165
fractions
were
obtained
from
each
column
.
These
were
read
at
280
m
|
m
in
a
Beckman
model
DU
spectrophotometer
and
tested
for
antibody
activity
as
described
above
.
For
protein
identification
,
fractions
from
the
column
were
concentrated
by
pervaporation
against
a
stream
of
air
at
5
`
C
or
by
negative
pressure
dialysis
in
an
apparatus
which
permitted
simultaneous
concentration
of
the
protein
and
dialysis
against
isotonic
saline
.
During
the
latter
procedure
the
temperature
was
maintained
at
2
`
C
by
surrounding
the
apparatus
with
ice
.
Because
negative
pressure
dialysis
gave
better
recovery
of
proteins
,
permitted
detection
of
proteins
concentrated
from
very
dilute
solutions
and
was
a
gentler
procedure
,
it
was
used
in
all
but
the
earliest
experiments
.
Paper_electrophoresis
was
carried_out
on
the
concentrated
samples
in
a
Spinco
model
R
cell
using
barbital
buffer
,
pH
8.6
,
ionic
strength
0.075
,
at
room_temperature
on
Whatman
3
MM
filter_paper
.
Five
milliamperes
/
cell
were
applied
for
18
hr
,
after
which
the
strips
were
stained
with
bromophenol_blue
and
densitometry
was
carried_out
using
a
Spinco_Analytrol
.
When
paper_electrophoresis
was
to
be
used
for
preparation
,
eight
strips
of
a
whole
serum
sample
or
a
chromatographic
fraction
concentrated
by
negative
pressure
dialysis
were
run
/
chamber
under
the
conditions
described
above
.
At
the
end
of
the
run
,
the
strips
in
the
third
and
sixth
positions
in
each
chamber
were
dried
,
stained
for
1
hr
,
washed
and
dried
,
while
the
other
strips
were
maintained
in
a
horizontal
position
at
1
`
C
.
The
unstained
strips
were
then
marked
,
using
the
stained
ones
as
a
guide
,
and
cut
transversely
so
as
to
separate
the
various
protein
bands
.
The
strip
sections
containing
a
given
protein
were
pooled
,
eluted
with
0.5
ml
of
isotonic
saline
,
and
the
eluates
were
tested
for
antibody
activity
.
Fractions
from
the
column
which
were
to
be
subjected
to
analytical
ultracentrifugation
were
concentrated
by
negative
pressure
dialysis
and
dialyzed
for
16
hr
in
the
cold
against
at_least
500
volumes
of
phosphate
buffered
saline
,
pH
7.2
,
ionic
strength
0.154
.
They
were
then
centrifuged
at
59780
rpm
for
35
to
80
min
at
20
`
C
in
a
Spinco
model
E
ultracentrifuge
at
a
protein
concentration
of
1.00
to
1.25
%
.
Sedimentation
coefficients
were
computed
as
*
*
f
values
and
relative
amounts
of
the
various
components
were
calculated
from
the
Schlieren
patterns
.
For
preparative
ultracentrifugation
,
fractions
from
the
column
were
concentrated
by
negative
pressure
dialysis
to
volumes
of
1
ml
or
less
,
transferred
to
cellulose
tubes
and
diluted
to
12
ml
with
isotonic
saline
.
Ultracentrifugation
was
then
carried_out
in
a
Spinco
model
L
ultracentrifuge
at
40000
rpm
for
125
to
150
min
,
refrigeration
being
used
throughout
the
run
.
Successive
1
-
ml
fractions
were
then
drawn
off
with
a
hypodermic_syringe
,
starting
at
the
top
of
the
tube
,
and
tested
for
agglutinin
activity
.
Other
methods
will
be
described
below
.
The
insoluble
material
which
precipitated
during
dialysis
against
starting_buffer
always
showed
intense
agglutinin
activity
,
regardless
of
the
blood_group
of
the
donor
.
With
either
of
the
gradients
described
,
chromatography
on
DEAE-cellulose
separated
agglutinins
of
the
ABO
series
into
at_least
three
regions
(
Figs.
1
and
2
)
:
one
of
extremely
low
anionic
binding
capacity
,
one
of
low
anionic
binding
capacity
and
one
of
high
anionic
binding
capacity
.
These
have
been
labeled
Regions
1
,
2
,
and
4
,
respectively
,
in
Fig.
1
.
When
the
early
part
of
the
gradient
was
flattened
,
either
by
using
the
gradient
shown
in
Fig.
2
or
by
allowing
the
``
cone
sphere
''
gradient
to
become
established
more
slowly
,
Region
2
activity
could
sometimes
be
separated
into
two
areas
(
donors
P._J.
and
R._S.
,
Fig.
1
and
E._M.
,
Fig.
2
)
.
The
latter
procedure
gave_rise
to
a
small
active
protein
peak
(
Region
1a
)
between
Regions
1
and
2
.
In
2
of
15
experiments
on
whole
serum
a
region
of
agglutinin
activity
with
intermediate
anionic
binding
capacity
was
detected
(
Region
3
,
Fig.
1
)
.
Moreover
,
after
concentration
using
negative
pressure
dialysis
,
agglutinin
activity
could
sometimes
be
detected
in
the
region
designated
2a
(
donors
P._J.
,
D._A.
,
and
J._F.
,
Fig.
1
)
.
Not
all
these
regions
exhibited
equal
agglutinating_activity
,
as
evidenced
by
titer
and
the
extent
of
the
active
areas
.
In
all
cases
,
most
of
the
activity
lay_in
the
region
of
high
anionic
binding
capacity
.
This
was
particularly
noticeable
in
group
A
and
group
B
sera
,
in
which
cases
activity
in
Regions
1
and
2
was
usually
not
detectable
without
prior
concentration
and
occasionally
could
not
be
detected
at_all
.
There
appeared
to
be
no
difference
in
the
distribution
of
anti
-
A
and
anti
-
B
activity
in
group
O
serum
,
though
in
two
group
O
donors
(
J._F.
and
E._M.
)
only
one
type
of
agglutinin
was
found
in
the
regions
of
low
anionic
binding
capacity
(
Figs.
1
and
2
)
.
Several
samples
of
citrated
plasma
were
fractionated
in
our
laboratory
by
Method
6
of
Cohn
et_al
.
These
fractions
were
tested
for
ABO
agglutinin
activity
,
using
fractions
from
group
AB
plasma
as
a
control
.
As_expected
,
most
of
the
activity
was
found
in
Fraction
*
*
f
,
with
slight
activity
seen
in
Fraction
4
,
-
1
.
A
sample
of
Fraction
*
*
f
from
group
O
plasma
was
dissolved
in
starting_buffer
,
dialyzed
against
this
buffer
and
subjected
to
chromatography
using
the
gradient
shown
in
Fig.
2
.
Once_again
,
both
anti
-
A
and
anti
-
B
activities
were
found
in
the
insoluble
material
precipitated
during
dialysis
.
Similarly
,
both
types
of
antibodies
were
found
in
three
regions
of
the
chromatographic
eluate
,
having
extremely
low
,
low
,
and
high
anionic
binding
capacity
,
respectively
(
Fig.
3
)
.
Chromatography
of
whole
sera
revealed
that
the
areas
of
Rh_antibody
activity
were
generally
continuous
and
wide
.
The
incomplete
antibody
activity
appeared
in
the
early
part
of
the
chromatogram
;
the
complete
,
in
the
latter
part
.
The
serum
containing
the
mixed
type
of
complete
and
incomplete
antibodies
showed
activity
in
both
regions
(
Fig.
1
)
.
In
all
cases
the
activity
against
*
*
f
cells
was
spread
over
a
wider
area
than
that
with
*
*
f
cells
,
regardless
of
the
type
of
test
(
saline
,
albumin
,
indirect_Coombs
)
used
for
comparison
.
The
insoluble
material
resulting
from
dialysis
against
starting_buffer
always
showed
strong
activity
.
In_fact
agglutination
of
*
*
f
cells
in
saline
could
be
produced
by
the
insoluble
material
from
sera
containing
``
only
''
incomplete
antibody
activity
.
This
was
later
known
to
be
the
result
of
concentrating
the
minute
amount
of
complete
antibody
found
in
these
sera
;
when
the
insoluble
fraction
was
suspended
in
a
volume
of
saline
equal_to
that
of
the
original
serum
sample
,
no
complete
antibody
activity
could
be
detected
.
