``
I
had
a
rather
small
place
of
my
own
.
A
nice
bachelor
apartment
in
a
place
called
the
Lancaster_Arms
''
.
``
Uhhu
''
,
she
said
,
hardly
listening
as
she
studied
her
left
eyelid
.
``
And_then
I
had
another
place
farther
downtown
I
used
as
a
studio
''
.
``
Uhhu
''
.
``
I
'm
not
a
man
who
has
many
close
intimate
friends
,
Carla
''
,
he
said
,
wanting
her
to
know
all
about
him
.
``
Oh
,
I
'd
drink
with
newspaper
people
.
I
think
I
was
what
you
might
call
a
convivial
man
,
and
yet
it
was
when
I
was
alone
in
my
studio
,
doing
my
work
,
that
I
really
felt
alive
.
But
I
think
a
man
needs
at_least
one
intimate
friend
to
communicate
with
''
.
Pausing
,
he
waited
for
her
to
turn
,
to
ask
a
question
.
She
showed
no
interest
at_all
in
the
life
he
had
led
back
home
,
and
it
hurt
him
a_little
.
``
Well
,
what
about
you
,
Carla
''
?
``
Me
''
?
she
asked
,
turning
slowly
.
``
What
about
me
''
?
``
Did
you
make
friends
easily
''
?
``
Umm
,
uhhu
''
.
``
Somehow
I
imagine
that
as
you
grew_up
you
were
alone
a_lot
.
How
about
it
''
?
``
I
guess
so
''
,
she
said
taking
a
Kleenex
from
her
purse
.
When
she
had
wiped
some
of
the
lipstick
from
her
mouth
,
she
stared
solemnly
at
her
image
in
the
mirror
.
``
Are
your
people
still
alive
''
?
he
asked
,
trying
to
touch
a
part
of
her
life
Alberto
had
n't
discussed
;
so
he
could
have
something
of
her
for
himself
.
``
You
talk
so
well
,
Carla
''
,
he
went_on
.
``
You
seem
to
have
read
so
much
,
you
have
a
natural
gift
for
words
''
,
he
added
,
trying
to
flatter
her
vanity
.
``
You
must
have
been
good
at
history
at
school
.
Where
did
you
go_to
school
''
?
``
What
is
this
''
?
she
asked
,
turning
suddenly
.
``
Do
n't
you
know
all
about
me
by
this
time
?
My
name
's
Carla_Caneli
.
This
is
my
town
.
I
sleep_with
you
.
You
know
something
more
about
me
every_day
,
do
n't
you
?
Would
you
be
happier
if
I
made_up
some
stories
about
my
life
,
told
you
some
lies
?
Why
are
you
trying
to
worry
me
''
?
``
I
'm
not
trying
to
worry
you
''
.
``
Well
,
all_right
then
''
.
The
cleansing
tissues
she
had
been
using
had
been
falling
on
the
floor
,
and
he
got_up
and
picked_up
one
,
then
another
,
hoping
she
would
notice
what
he
was
doing
.
At
home
he
had
been
a
clean
orderly
man
,
and
now
he
had_to
hide
his
annoyance
.
Was
she
just
naturally
sloppy
about
everything
but
her
physical
appearance
?
he
wondered
.
Would
he
have_to
clean_up
after
her
every_day
,
clean
the
kitchen
,
the
bathroom
,
and
get_down
on
his
knees
and
scrub
the
kitchen
floor
,
then
hang_up
her
dresses
,
pick_up
her
stockings
,
make
the
bed
while
she
lay_around
?
He
straightened_up
,
ready
to
vent
his
exasperation
,
then
grew
afraid
.
If
he
dwelt
on
the
indignities
he
suffered
he
would
lose
all
respect
for
her
,
and
without
the
respect
he
might
lose
his
view
of
her
,
too
.
``
What
's
the_matter
''
?
she
asked
suddenly
.
``
Nothing
.
Nothing
at_all
''
,
he
said
quietly
.
``
Let
's
go_out
''
.
``
Are
those
the
only
shoes
you
have
,
Sam
''
?
``
What
's
the_matter
with
them
''
?
``
The
heavy
thick
soles
.
Look
at
them
''
.
``
They
're
an
expensive
English
shoe
for
walking_around
a_lot
.
I
like
them
''
.
``
Sam
,
no
one
around
here
wears
such
heavy
soles
.
Ca
n't
you
get
another
pair
''
?
``
Maybe
I
could
''
,
he
said
,
surprised
that
she
could
turn
from
herself
and
notice
anything
about
him
.
``
I
'll
get
an
elegant
pair
of
thin
soled
Italian
shoes
tomorrow
,
Carla
''
.
``
And
I
do
n't
know
why
you
want
to
go_on
wearing
that
outfit
''
,
she
said
,
making
a
face
.
``
What
's
the_matter
with
it
''
?
He
had
put_on
the
gray
jacket
and
the
dark
gray
slacks
and
the
fawn
colored
shirt
he
had
worn
that
first
night
in
Rome
when
he
had
encountered
her
on
the
street
.
``
Oh
,
Sam
.
You
look_like
a
tweedy
Englishman
.
Ca
n't
you
wear
something
else
and
look
a_little
more
as
though
you
belonged
''
?
``
I
do
n't
mind
at_all
''
,
he
said
,
delighted
with
her
attention
.
Changing
his
clothes
,
he
put_on
his
dark-blue
flannel
suit
,
and
laid
away
the
gray
jacket
with
the
feeling
that
he
might
be
putting
it
aside
for_good
.
But
it
was
a
hopeful
sign
,
he
told
himself
.
She
no_longer
wanted
anything
about
him
to
remind
her
of
the
circumstances
of
their
meeting
that
first
night
in
Parioli
.
That
day
they
loafed
around
,
just
getting
the
feel
of
the
city
.
They
looked
at
the
ruins
of
the
old
Roman
wall
on
the
lower
Via_Veneto
,
then
they
went_to
the
Farnese_Gardens
.
She
had
some
amusing
scandal
about
the
Farneses
in
the
old
days
.
Then
they
took
a
taxi
to
Trastevere
.
``
There
's
a
church
you
should
see
''
,
she
said
.
And
when
they
stood
by
the
fountain
in
the
piazza
looking
at
Santa_Maria
he
had_to
keep
a
straight_face
,
not
letting_on
he
had
been
there
with
Alberto
.
He
let
her
tell
him
all
about
the
church
.
Then
they
had
dinner
.
All
evening
she
was
eloquent
and
pleased
with
herself
.
When
they
got
home
at
midnight
she
was
tired_out
.
And
in
the
morning
when
he
woke_up
at
ten
the
church_bells
were
ringing
.
He
had
never
heard
so
many
bells
,
and
as
he
lay
there
listening
,
he
thought_of
her
scolding
him
for
his
remarks
when
he
had
looked
up
at
the
obelisk
and
the
church
at
the
top
of
the
Spanish_Steps
.
It
was
a
good
thing
that
she
clung
to
her
religion
,
he
thought
.
She
might
like
to
take
him
to
St._Peter
's
.
``
Carla
,
wake_up
''
,
he
said
shaking
her
.
``
It
's
ten
o_'_clock
.
Are
n't
you
going_out
to
mass
?
You
could
take
me
to
St._Peter
's
''
.
``
Uhhu
''
,
she
muttered
.
``
Come_on
,
you
'll
be
late
''
.
``
I
think
I
'll
sleep_in
this
morning
''
,
she
said
drowsily
,
and
as
she
snuggled
against
him
,
he
wondered
if
she
ever
went_to
church
.
Why
did
he
want
her
to
go_to
church
?
he
wondered
.
Probably
because
it
was
a
place
where
she
might
get
a
feeling
of
certainty
and
security
.
It
would
be
good
for
her
.
It
was
too_bad
he
had
no
feeling
himself
for
church
.
Not
his
poor
mother
's
fault
.
She
would
have
been
better_off
if
she
had
stuck_to
her
Bible
.
As
for
himself
,
he
just
did
n't
have
the
temperament
for
it
.
From
the
time
he
had
been
at
college
he
had
achieved
a
certain
tranquility
and
composure
by
accepting
the
fact
that
there
were
certain
things
he
could
never
know
.
Then
he
thought_of
those
Old_Testament
figures
on
the
ceiling
of
the
Sistine_Chapel
.
Just
figures
out
of
a
tribal
folklore
.
Could
he
honestly
believe
it
would
be
good
for
Carla
to
have
those
old
prophets
gripping
her
imagination
now
?
Being
a
woman
though
,
she
would
take
only
what
she
needed
from
church
.
It
was
too_bad
he
was
n't
a
Catholic
himself
.
Or
a
Protestant
,
or
one
of
those
amusing
dogmatic
atheists
,
or
a
strict
orthodox
Communist
.
What
was
the_matter
with
him
that
they
all
wearied
him
?
It
was
the
times
,
he
was
sure
.
All
the
ideologies
changing
from
day
to
day
,
right
under
his
eyes
,
so
how
could
a
man
look_to
any
one
of
them
for
an
enlargement
of
his
freedom
?
It
was
all_too
wearying
.
Look
somewhere
else
.
But
where
?
Just_the_same
,
he
thought
,
pondering
over
it
,
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
a
girl
like
Carla
if
she
got_up
and
went_to
church
.
A
half_hour
later
he
got
her
up
to
go_out
for
breakfast
so
the
Ferraros
,
hearing
them
hurrying
down
the
stairs
,
would
think
they
were
going_to
a
late
mass
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
if
the
Ferraros
felt
sure
of
them
,
could
place
them
,
it
would
help
him
to
feel
more
sure
of
himself
with
Carla
.
``
Since
we
're
having
coffee
with
them
this
afternoon
''
,
he
said
,
``
I
think
I
'll
ask
the
daughter
if
we
can
pay
her
to
come
in
every_day
to
clean
for
us
''
.
And
he
waited
for
her
to
say
,
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
can
do
it
,
Sam
.
There
's
so
little
to
do
''
.
``
Why
not
''
?
she
said
.
``
I
'm
not
good
at
that
kind
of
thing
''
.
``
This
afternoon
let
's
take
an
air
with
them
.
Let
's
be
fine
superior
people
of
great
dignity
''
,
he
said
as
if
he
were
joking
.
``
If
you
find
it
necessary
,
Sam
,
go_ahead
''
,
she
said
,
turning
on
the
stair
.
``
I
am
what
I
am
.
I
can
n't
help
it
''
.
Her
words
remained
with
him
,
worrying
him
for
hours
.
He
did
n't
know
how
she
would
behave
with
other
people
.
When
they
walked
into
the
Ferraro
apartment
,
the
old
lady
,
bowing
and
smiling
,
said
softly
.
``
Ciao
,
''
and
put_out
her
hand
.
Her
little
brown
face
wrinkled
up
,
her
brown
eyes
gleamed
,
and
with
her
little
gestures
she
said
all
the
courteous
things
.
Agnese
,
smiling
too
,
said
,
``
'
Ello
''
,
and_then
more
slowly
,
``
I
am
happy
''
.
And
they
sat_down
and
began
their
little
coffee
party
.
The
Ferraros
offered
them
biscuits
with
the
coffee
.
Acting
only
as
interpreter
Carla
,
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
,
was
utterly
impersonal
.
She
would
turn
to
them
,
then
turn
to
him
,
then
turn
again
.
Watching
her
,
he
felt
like
a
spectator
at
a
tennis
game
,
with
the
ball
being
bounced
back_and_forth
.
Signora_Ferraro
,
bobbing
her
head
encouragingly
,
asked
Sam
about
Canada
,
having
a
special
interest
.
Carla
translated
.
The
old_woman
had
a
nephew
from
North_Italy
,
a
poor
boy
from
a
lumber
mill
who
had
got
tired_of
the
seasonal
unemployment
,
and
who
had
migrated
to
Canada
to
work_on
the
railway
.
For
a
year
the
boy
had
lived
in
the
bush
in
a
boxcar
.
Did
many_of
Sam
's
countrymen
live
in
boxcars
in
the
bush
?
Had
Sam
ever
lived
in
a
boxcar
?
she
wanted
to
know
.
Regretfully
Sam
explained
that
he
had
no
experience
with
boxcars
.
Just_the_same
,
the
old_woman
said
,
she
would
write
to
her
nephew
in
his
boxcar
and
tell
him
she
had
met
a
nice
man
from
his
adopted
country
.
And
Sam
thanked
her
,
and
hoped
he
might
meet
her
nephew
back
home
,
and
asked
her
if
she
had
any
further
news
of
the
Pope
.
A
very
great
Pope
,
this
one
,
the
old_woman
explained
,
her
black
eyes
sparkling
.
An
intellectual
.
But
very
mystical
too
.
It
was
said
that
he
had
had
a
vision
.
Just_as
thousands
that
day
in
Portugal
had
seen
the
sun
dancing
in
the
sky
,
he
had
seen
the
same
thing
later
in
his
own
garden
,
and
she
turned_to
Agnese
for
confirmation
.
Agnese
had
been
sitting
quietly
,
listening
with
the
serenity
of
the
unaware
.
Now
a
little
flush
came_on
her
pale
homely
face
and
enchantment
in
her
eyes
.
The
Holy_Father
would
die
soon
,
she
said
to
Carla
,
so
she
could
translate
for
Sam
,
although
he
had
a
brilliant
doctor
,
a
man
who
did
not
need
the
assistance
of
those
doctors
offered
by
the
great
rulers
of
the
world
.
Yes
,
the
Pope
could
die
and
quickly
be
made
a
saint
.
No
,
he
was
indeed
a
saint
now
.
Nodding
approvingly
and
swelling
with
importance
,
the
old
lady
whispered
confidentially
.
There
was
a
certain
discontent
among
the
cardinals
.
The
Pope
,
in
the
splendor
of
his
great
intellect
,
had
neglected
them
a_little
.
There
would
be
changes
made
,
and
Signor_Raymond
should
understand
that
when
the
Pope
died
it
was
like
the
end
of
a
regime
in
Rome
.
Jobs
would
be
lost
and
new
faces
would
become
prominent
.
Did
Signor_Raymond
understand
?
Indeed
he
did
,
Sam
said
solemnly
,
trying
to
get
Carla
's
eye
.
Surely
she
could
see
that
these
women
were
her
Italians
,
too
,
he
thought
.
Devout
,
orthodox
and
plain
like
a
family
she
might
meet
in
Brooklyn
or
Malta
or
Ireland
.
But
Carla
;
eyes
were
on
Agnese
whose
glowing
face
and
softening
eyes
gave
her
a
look
of
warmth
and
happiness
.
And
Carla
,
watching
in
wonder
,
turned_to
Sam
.
``
It
means
so
much
to
her
.
It
's
like
a
flame
,
I
guess
''
,
she
said
in
a
dreamy
tone
.
