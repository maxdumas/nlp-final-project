Probably
THE
hottest
thing
that
has
hit
the
Dallas
investment
community
in
years
was
the
Morton
Foods_stock
issue
,
which
was
sold
to
the
public
during
the
past
week
.
For
many
reasons
,
the
demand
to
buy
shares
in
the
Dallas-headquartered
company
was
tremendous
.
It
was
not
a
case
of
the
investment_bankers
having
to
sell
the
stock
;
it
was
more
one
of
allotting
a_few
shares
to
a_number_of
customers
and
explaining
to
others
why
they
had
no_more
to
sell
.
Investors
who
wanted
100
shares
in
many
cases
ended_up
with
25
,
and
customers
who
had
put_in
a
bid
to
buy
400
shares
found
themselves
with
100
and
counted
themselves
lucky
to
get
that
many
.
In_fact
,
very_few
customers
,
anywhere
in
the
nation
,
were
able
to
get
more_than
100
shares
.
Some
Dallas
investment
firms
got
only
100
shares
,
for
all_of
their
customers
.
A
measure
of
how
hot
the
stock
was
,
can
be
found
in_what
happened
to
it
on
the
market
as
soon
as
trading
began
.
The
stock
was
sold
in
the
underwriting
at
a
price
of
$
12.50
a
share
.
The
first
over-the-counter
trade
Wednesday
afternoon
at
Eppler
,
Guerin
+
Turner
,
the
managing
underwriter
,
was
at
$
17
a
share
.
And
from_that
the
stock
moved
right_on
up
until
it
was
trading
Thursday
morning
at
around
$
22
a
share
.
But
the
Morton
Foods
issue
was
hot
long
before
it
was
on
the
market
.
Indeed
,
from
the
moment
the
reports
of
the
coming
issue
first
started
circulating
in
Dallas
last
January
,
the
inquiries
and
demand
for
the
stock
started
building_up
.
Letters
by
the
reams
came_in
from
investment
firms
all_over
the
nation
,
all_of
them
wanting
to
get
a
part
of
the
shares
that
would
be
sold
(
185000
to
the
public
at
$
12.50
,
with
another
5000
reserved
for
Morton
Foods
employes
at
$
11.50
a
share
)
.
There
was
even
a
cable
in
French
from
a
bank
in
Switzerland
that
had
somehow
learned
about
the
Dallas
stock
offering
.
``
We
subscribe
500
shares
of
Morton
Foods
of
Texas
.
Cable
confirmation
''
,
it
said
translated
.
But
E._G._T.
could
not
let
the_Swiss
bank
have
even
10
shares
.
After
it
allotted
shares
to
41
underwriters
and
52
selling
group
members
from
coast
to
coast
there
were
not_many
shares
for
anyone
.
But
the
result
of_it
all
was
,
E._G._T.
partner
Dean_Guerin
believes
,
an
effective
distribution
of
the
stock
to
owners
all_over
the
nation
.
``
I
feel
confident
the
stock
will
qualify
for
the
'
national
list
''
'
,
he
said
,
meaning
its
market_price
would
be
quoted
regularly
in
newspapers
all_over
the
country
.
He
was
also
pleased
with
the
wide
distribution
because
he
thought
it
proved
again
his
argument
that
Dallas
investment
men
can
do
just_as
good
a
job
as
the
big
New_York
investment_bankers
claim
only
they
can
do
.
But
what
made
the
Morton
Foods_stock
issue
such
a
hot
one
?
The
answer
is
that
it
was
a
combination
of
circumstances
.
First
,
the
general
stock_market
has
been
boiling
upward
for
the
last
few
months
,
driving
stocks
of
all
kinds
up
.
As
a
result
,
it
is
not
easy
to
find
a
stock
priced
as
the
Morton
issue
was
priced
(
at
roughly
10
times
1960
earnings
,
to
yield
a_little
over
5
per_cent
on
the
64
c
anticipated
dividend
)
.
Second
,
the
``
potato_chip
industry
''
has
caught
the
fancy
of
investors
lately
,
and
until
Morton
Foods
came_along
there
were
only
two
potato_chip
stocks
-
Frito
and
H._W._Lay
-
on
the
market
.
Both
of
those
have
had
dynamic
run-ups
in
price
on
the
market
in
recent
months
,
both
were
selling
at
higher
price-earnings
and
yield
bases
than
Morton
was
coming
to
market
at
,
and
everyone
who
knew
anything
about
it
expected
the
Morton
stock
to
have
a
fast
run-up
.
And
third
,
the
potato_chip
industry
has
taken_on
the
flavor
of
a
``
growth
''
industry
in
the
public
mind
of_late
.
Foods
,
which
long
had
been
considered
``
recession
resistant
''
but
hardly
dynamic
stocks
,
have
been
acting
like
growth_stocks
,
going_to
higher
price-earnings
ratios
.
The
potato_chip
industry
these
days
is
growing
,
not_only
as
a
result
of
population
increase
and
public
acceptance
of
convenience_foods
,
but
also
because
of
a
combination
of
circumstances
that
has
led
to
growth
by
merger
.
The
history
of
the
U._S.
potato_chip
industry
is
that
many_of
today
's
successful
companies
got_started
during
the
deep
depression
days
.
Those
that
remain
are
those
that
were
headed
by
strong
executives
,
men
with
the
abilities
to
last
almost
30
years
in
the
competitive
survival_of_the_fittest
.
But
today
many_of
those
men
are
reaching
retirement
age
and
suddenly
realizing
that
they
face
an
estate_tax
problem
with
their
closely
held
companies
and
also
that
they
have
no
second-echelon
management
in
their
firms
.
So
they
go
looking_for
mergers
with
other
firms
that
have
publicly
quoted
stock
,
and
almost
daily
they
pound
on
the
doors
of
firms
like
Frito
.
All
those
things
combined
to
make
the
Morton
Foods_stock
the
hot_issue
that
it
was
and
is
.
Now
,
if
Morton
's
newest
product
,
a
corn_chip
known
as
Chip-o
's
,
turns_out
to
sell
as_well
as
its
stock
did
,
the
stock
may
turn_out
to
be
worth
every
cent
of
the
prices
that
the
avid
buyers
bid
it
up_to
.
Dallas
and
North_Texas
is
known
world-wide
as
the
manufacturing
and
distribution
center
of
cotton
gin
machinery
and
supplies
,
valued
in
the
millions
of
dollars
.
More_than
10
companies
maintain
facilities
in
Dallas
and
one
large
manufacturer
is
located
to_the_north
at
Sherman
.
It
is
no
coincidence
that
the
Texas_Cotton_Ginner
's
Association
is
meeting
here
this
week
for
the
46
th
time
in
their
52
-
year
history
.
The
exhibition
of
cotton
ginning
machinery
at
the
State_Fair
grounds
is
valued_at
more_than
a_million
dollars
.
It
weighs
in
the
tons
,
so
the
proximity
of
factory
and
exhibition_area
makes
it
possible
for
an
outstanding
exhibit
each_year
.
A
modern
cotton
gin
plant
costs
in
the
neighborhood
of
$
250000
,
and
it
's
a
safe
assumption
that
a
large
percentage
of
new
gins
in
the
U._S.
and
foreign
countries
contain
machinery
made
in_this
area
.
The
Murray_Co.

gin
machinery
that
's
sold
anywhere
cotton
is
grown
.
Murray
makes
a
complete
line
of
ginning
equipment
except
for
driers
and
cleaners
,
and
this
machinery
is
purchased
from
a
Dallas-based
firm
.
The
Continental_Gin_Co.
began
operations
in
Dallas
in
1899
.
The
present
company
is
a
combination
of
several
smaller
ones
that
date_back
to
1834
.
Headquarters
is
in
Birmingham
,
Ala.
.
Factories
are
located
here
and

by
more_than
200

the
cotton-growing
world
.
Hardwicke-Etter_Co.
of

makes
a
full
line
of
gin
machinery
and
equipment
.
The
firm
recently
expanded
domestic
sales
into
the
Southeastern
states
as
a
result
of
an
agreement
with
Cen-Tennial_Gin_Co.
.
They
export
also
.
The
company
began
operation
in
1900
with

making
cotton
processing
equipment
.

Hardwicke-Etter
employs
300
-
450
people

and
heaters
,
and
they
lay_claim_to
being
the
first
maker
(
1910
)
of
boil
extraction
equipment
.
The
increase
in
mechanical
harvesting
of
cotton
makes
cleaning
and
drying
equipment
a
must
for
modern
gin
operation
.
Mitchell
employs
a

400
people
.

New
car
sales
in
Dallas_County
during
March
showed
slight
signs
of
recovering
from
the_doldrums
which
have
characterized
sales
this
year
.
Registrations
of
new
cars
in
Dallas_County
cracked
the
3000
mark
in
March
for_the_first_time
this
year
.
Totaling
3399
,
sales
jumped
14
per_cent
over
February
's
2963
.
However
,
compared
with
March
1960
new
car
sales
of
4441
,
this
March
was
off
23
per_cent
.
On
a
quarter-to-quarter
comparison
,
the
first_quarter
of
1961
total
of
9273
cars
was
21
per_cent
behind
the
previous
year
's
3
-
month
total
of
11744
.
This
year-to-year
decline
for
Dallas_County
closely
follows
the
national
trend
-
estimated
sales
of
domestic
cars
in
the
U._S.
for
first
three
months
of
1961
were
about
1212000
or
80
per_cent
of
the
total
in
the
first_quarter
a
year
earlier
.
With
the
March
pickup
,
dealers
are
optimistic
that
the
April-June
quarter
will
equal
or
top
last
year
.
The
March
gain
plus
this
optimism
has
been
encouraging
enough
to
prompt
auto_makers
to
boost
production
schedules
for
the
next
quarter
.
On
the
local
level
,
compacts
continue
to
grab
a
larger
share
of
the
market
at
the
expense
of
lower-priced
standard
models
and
foreign
cars
.
Only
three
standard
models
-
Buick
,
Chrysler
,
and
Mercury
-
had
slight
year-to-year
gains
in
March
sales
in
the
county
.
