Rousseau
is
so
persuasive
that
Voltaire
is
almost
convinced
that
he
should
burn
his
books
,
too
.
But
while
the
two
men
are
riding
into
the
country
,
where
they
are
going
to
dinner
,
they
are
attacked
in
the
dark
of
the
forest
by
a
band
of
thieves
,
who
strip
them
of
everything
,
including
most
of
their
clothes
.
``
You
must
be
a
very
learned
man
''
,
says
Voltaire
to
one
of
the
bandits
.
``
A
learned
man
''
?
the
bandit
laughs
in
his
face
.
But
Voltaire
perseveres
.
He
goes_to
the
chief
himself
.
``
At
what
university
did
you
study
''
?
he
asks
.
He
refuses
to
believe
that
the
bandit
chief
never
attended
a
higher
institution
.
``
To
have
become
so
corrupt
''
,
he
says
,
``
surely
you
must
have
studied
many
arts
and
sciences
''
.
The
chief
,
annoyed
by
these
questions
,
knocks
Voltaire
down
and
shouts
at
him
that
he
not_only
never
went_to
any
school
,
but
never
even
learned
how
to
read
.
When
finally
the
two
bedraggled
men
reach
their
friend
's
home
,
Voltaire
's
fears
are
once_again
aroused
.
For
it
is
such
a
distinguished
place
,
with
such
fine
works_of_art
and
such
a
big
library
,
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
but
that
the
owner
has
become
depraved
by
all
this
culture
.
To
Voltaire
's
surprise
,
however
,
their
host
gives
them
fresh
clothes
to
put_on
,
opens
his
purse
to
lend
them
money
and
sits
them
down
before
a
good
dinner
.
Immediately
after
dinner
,
however
,
Rousseau
asks
for
still
another
favor
.
Could
he
have
pen
and
paper
,
please
?
He
is
in
a
hurry
to
write
another
essay
against
culture
.
Such
was
the
impromptu
that
Voltaire
gave
to
howls
of
laughter
at
Sans_Souci
and
that
was
soon
circulated
in
manuscript
throughout
the
literary
circles
of
Europe
,
to
be
printed
sometime
later
,
but
with
the
name
of
Timon_of_Athens
,
the
famous
misanthrope
,
substituted
for
that
of
Rousseau
.
How
cruel
!
But
at_the_same_time
how
understandable
.
How
could
the
rich
,
for
whom
life
was
made
so
simple
,
ever
understand
the
subterfuges
,
the
lies
,
the
frauds
,
the
errors
,
sins
and
even
crimes
to
which
the
poor
were
driven
in
their
efforts
to
overcome
the
great
advantages
the
rich
had
in
the
race
of
life
?
How
,
for_example
,
could
a
Voltaire
understand
the
strange
predicament
in
which
a
Rousseau
would
find
himself
when
,
soon
after
the
furor
of
his
first
Discourse
,
he
acquired
still
another
title
to
fame
?
This
time
as
a
musician
.
As
a
composer
.
Ever
since
he
had
first
begun
to
study
music
and
to
teach
it
,
Rousseau
had
dreamed
of
piercing
through
to
fame
as
the
result
of
a
successful
opera
.
But
his
facility
in
this
genre
was
not
great
.
And
his
efforts
to
get
a
performance
for
his
Gallant_Muses
invariably
failed
.
And
for
good
reasons
.
His
operatic
music
had
little
merit
.
But
then
one
day
,
while
on
a
week
's
visit
to
the
country
home
of
a
retired
Swiss
jeweler
,
Rousseau
amused
the
company
with
a_few
little
melodies
he
had
written
,
to
which
he
attached
no
great
importance
.
He
was
really
amazed
to
discover
the
other
guests
so
excited
about
these
delicate
little
songs
.
``
Put
a_few
such
songs
together
''
,
they
urged
him
.
``
String
them
onto
some
sort
of
little
plot
,
and
you
'll
have
a
delightful
operetta
''
.
He
did
n't
believe
them
.
``
Nonsense
''
,
he
said
.
``
This
is
the
sort
of
stuff
I
write
and
then
throw_away
''
!
``
Heaven_forbid
''
!
cried
the
ladies
,
enchanted
by
his
music
.
``
You
must
make
an
opera
out
of
this
material
''
.
And
they
would
n't
leave_off
arguing
and
pleading
until
he
had
promised
.
Oh
,
the
irony
and
the
bitterness
of_it
!
That
after
all
his
years
of
effort
to
become
a
composer
,
he
should
now
,
now
when
he
was
still
stoutly
replying
to
the
critics
of
his
Discourse_on_the_Arts_and_Sciences
,
be
so
close
to
a
success
in
music
and
have_to
reject
it
.
Or
at_least
appear
to
reject
it
!
But
what
else
could
he
do
?
You
could
n't
on_the_one_hand
decry
the
arts
and
at_the_same_time
practice
them
,
could
you
?
Well
,
yes
,
perhaps
in
literature
,
since
you
could
argue
that
you
could
n't
keep
silent
about
your
feelings
against
literature
and
so
were
involved
in
spite
of
yourself
.
But
now
music
too
?
No
.
That
would
be
too_much
!
And
the
fault
,
of_course
,
was
Rameau
's
.
The
fault
was
Rameau
's
and
that
of
the
whole
culture
of
this
Parisian
age
.
For
it
was
Rameau
's
type
of
music
that
he
had
been
trying
to
write
,
and
that
he
could
n't
write
.
These
little
songs
,
however
,
were
sweet_nothings
from_the_heart
,
tender
memories
of
his
childhood
,
little
melodies
that
anyone
could
hum
and
that
would
make
one
want
to
weep
.
But
no
.
He
could
n't
appear
as
a
composer
now
.
That
glory
,
craved
for
so
long
,
was
now
forbidden
to
him
.
Still
,
just
for
the
ladies
,
and
just
for
this
once
,
for
this
one
weekend
in
the
country
,
he
would
make
a
little
piece
out
of
his
melodies
.
The
ladies
were
delighted
and
Jean_Jacques
was
applauded
.
And
everyone
went
to
work
to
learn
the
parts
which
he
wrote
.
But
then
,
after
the
little
operetta
had
been
given
its
feeble
amateur
rendering
,
everyone
insisted
that
it
was
too
good
to
be
lost
forever
,
and
that
the
Royal_Academy_of_Music
must
now
have
the
manuscript
in_order
to
give
it
the
really
first-rate
performance
it
merited
.
Rousseau
was
aware
that
he
must
seem
like
a
hypocrite
,
standing
there
and
arguing
that
he
could
not
possibly
permit
a
public
performance
.
The
ladies
especially
could
n't
understand
what
troubled
him
.
A
contradiction
?
Bah
,
what
was
a
contradiction
in
one
's
life
?
Every
woman
has
had
the
experience
of
saying
no
when
she
meant
yes
,
and
saying
yes
when
she
meant
no
.
Rousseau
had_to
admit
that
though
he
could
n't
agree
to
a
public
performance
,
he
would
indeed
,
just
for
his
own
private
satisfaction
,
dearly
love
to
know
how
his
work
would
sound
when
done
by
professional
musicians
and
by
trained
voices
.
``
I
'd
simply
like
to
know
if
it
is
as_good_as
you
kind
people
seem
to
think
''
,
he
said
.
Duclos
,
the
historian
,
pointed_out
to
Jean_Jacques
that
this
was
impossible
.
The
musicians
of
the
Royal_Opera
would
not
rehearse
a
work
merely
to
see
how
it
would
sound
.
Merely
to
satisfy
the
author
's
curiosity
.
Rousseau
agreed
.
But
he
recalled
that
Rameau
had
once
had
a
private
performance
of
his
opera
Armide
,
behind
closed
doors
,
just
for
himself
alone
.
Duclos
understood
what
was
bothering
Rousseau
:
that
the
writer
of
the
Prosopopoeia_of_Fabricius
should
now
become
known
as
the
writer
of
an
amusing
little
operetta
.
That
would
certainly
be
paradoxical
.
But
Duclos
thought
he
saw
a
way_out
.
``
Let
me
do
the
submitting
to
the
Royal_Academy
''
,
he
suggested
.
``
Your
name
will
never
appear
.
No_one
will
even
suspect
that
it
is
your
work
''
.
To_that
Rousseau
could
agree
.
But
now
what
crazy
twists
and
turns
of
his
emotions
!
Afraid
at
one_and_the_same
time
that
his
work
might
be
turned_down
-
which
would
be
a
blow
to
his
pride
even_though
no_one
knew
he
was
the
author
-
and
that
the
work
would
be
accepted
,
and
then
that
his
violent
feelings
in
the
matter
would
certainly
betray
how
deeply
concerned
he
was
in_spite_of
himself
.
And
how
anxious
this
lover
of
obscurity
was
for
applause
!
And
thus
torn
between
his
desire
to
be
known
as
the
composer
of
a
successful
opera
and
the
necessity
of
remaining
true
to
his
proclaimed
desire
for
anonymity
,
Rousseau
suffered
through
several
painful
weeks
.
All
these
emotions
were
screwed_up
to
new
heights
when
,
after
acceptance
and
the
first
rehearsals
,
there
ensued
such
a
buzz
of
excitement
among
Parisian
music_lovers
that
Duclos
had_to
come
running
to
Rousseau
to
inform
him
that
the
news
had
reached
the
superintendent
of
the
King
's
amusements
,
and
that
he
was
now
demanding
that
the
work
be
offered
first
at
the
royal
summer
palace
of
Fontainebleau
.
Imagine
the
honor
of_it
!
``
What
was
your
answer
''
?
Jean_Jacques
asked
,
striving
to
appear
unimpressed
.
``
I
refused
''
,
Duclos
said
.
``
What
else
could
I
do
?
Monsieur_de_Cury
was
incensed
,
of_course
.
But
I
said
I
would
first
have_to
get
the
author
's
permission
.
And
I
was
certain
he
would
refuse
''
.
How
infuriating
all
this
was
!
Why
had
not
this
success
come
to
him
before
he
had
plunged
into
his
Discourse
,
and
before
he
had
committed
himself
to
a
life
of
austerity
and
denial
?
Now
,
when
everything
was
opening_up
to
him
-
even
the
court
of
Louis_/_15
15
,
!
-
he
had_to
play
a
role
of
self-effacement
.
Back_and_forth
Duclos
had_to
go
,
between
M._de_Cury
and
Jean_Jacques
and
between
the
Duke_d'Aumont
and
Jean_Jacques
again
,
as
his
little
operetta
,
The_Village_Soothsayer
,
though
still
unperformed
,
took_on
ever
more
importance
.
And
of_course
the
news
of
who
the
composer
was
did
finally
begin
to
get_around
among
his
closest
friends
.
But
they
,
naturally
,
kept
his
secret
well
,
and
the
public
at_large
knew
only
of
a
great
excitement
in
musical
and
court
circles
.
How
titillating
it
was
to
go
among
people
who
did
not
know
him
as
the
composer
,
but
who
talked
in
the
most
glowing
terms
of
the
promise
of
the
piece
after
having
heard
the
first
rehearsals
.
The
furor
was
such_that
people
who
could
not
possibly
have
squirmed
their
way
into
the
rehearsals
were
pretending
that
they
were
intimate
with
the
whole
affair
and
that
it
would
be
sensational
.
And
listening
to
such
a
conversation
one
morning
while
taking
a
cup
of
chocolate
in
a
cafe
,
Rousseau
found
himself
bathed
in
perspiration
,
trembling
lest
his
authorship
become
known
,
and
at_the_same_time
dreaming
of
the
startling
effect
he
would
make
if
he
should
proclaim
himself
suddenly
as
the
composer
.
He
felt
himself
now
,
as
he
himself
says
in
his
Confessions
,
at
a
crucial
point
of
his
life
.
And
that
was
why
,
on
the
day
of
the
performance
,
when
a
carriage
from
the
royal
stables
called
to
take
him
to
the
palace
,
he
did
not
bother
to
shave
.
On_the_contrary
,
he
was
pleased
that
his
face
showed
a
neglect
of
several
days
.
Seeing
him
in
that
condition
,
and
about
to
enter
the
hall
where
the
King
,
the
Queen
,
the
whole
royal_family
and
all
the
members
of
the
highest
aristocracy
would
be
present
,
Grimm
and
the
Abbe_Raynal
and_others
tried
to
stop
him
.
``
You
can
n't
go_in
that
way
''
!
they
cried
.
``
Why
not
''
?
Jean_Jacques
asked
.
``
Who
is
going_to
stop
me
''
?
``
You
have
n't
dressed
for
the
occasion
''
!
they
pointed_out
to
him
.
``
I'm
dressed
as
I
always
am
''
,
Rousseau
said
.
``
Neither
better
nor
worse
''
.
``
At
home
,
yes
''
,
they
argued
.
``
But
here
you
are
in
the
palace
.
There
's
the
King
.
And
Madame_de_Pompadour
''
.
``
If
they
are
here
,
then
surely
I
have
the
right
to
be
here
''
,
Rousseau
said
.
``
And
even
more
right
.
Since
I
am
the
composer
''
!
``
But
in
such
a
slovenly
condition
''
.
``
What
is
slovenly
about
me
''
?
Rousseau
asked
.
``
Is
it
because
of
my
slovenliness
that
hair
grows
on
my
face
?
Surely
it
would
grow
there
whether
I
washed
myself
or
not
.
A_hundred
years
ago
I
would
have
worn
a
beard
with_pride
.
And
those
without
beards
would
have
stood_out
as
not
dressed
for
the
occasion
.
Now
times
have
changed
,
and
I
must
pretend
that
hair
does
n't
grow
on
my
face
.
That
's
the
fashion
.
And
fashion
is
the
real
king
here
.
Not
Louis_/_15
,
,
since
even
he
obeys
.
Now
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
,
I
should_like
to
hear
my
own
piece
performed
''
.
But
of_course
behind
his
boldness
he
did
n't
feel
bold
at_all
.
He
trembled
lest
his
piece
should
fail
.
And
this
in_addition
to
his
usual
fear
of
being
among
people
of
high_society
.
His
fear
of
making
some
inane
or
inappropriate
remark
.
And
even
deeper
than
that
:
his
fear
lest
in
this
closed
hall
he
should
suddenly
itch
to
relieve_himself
.
Could
he
walk
out
in_the_midst
of
his
piece
?
Here
,
before
the
court
?
Before
the
King
?
