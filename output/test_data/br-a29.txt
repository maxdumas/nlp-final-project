The
attractive
Greer_Garson
,
who
loves
beautiful
clothes
and
selects
them
as
carefully
as
she
does
her
professional
roles
,
prefers
timeless
classical
designs
.
Occasionally
she
deserts
the
simple
and
elegant
for
a
fun
piece
simple
because
``
It
's
unlike
me
''
.
In_private
life
,
Miss_Garson
is
Mrs._E._E._Fogelson
and
on
the
go
most_of
the
time
commuting
from
Dallas
,
where
they
maintain
an
apartment
,
to
their
California
home
in
Los_Angeles
'
suburban
Bel-Air
to
their
ranch
in
Pecos
,
New_Mexico
.
Therefore
,
her
wardrobe
is
largely
mobile
,
to
be
packed
at
a
moment
's
notice
and
to
shake
out
without
a
wrinkle
.
Her
creations
in
fashion
are
from
many
designers
because
she
does
n't
want
a
complete
wardrobe
from
any
one
designer
any_more
than
she
wants
``
all_of
her
pictures
by
one
painter
''
.
A
favorite
is
Norman_Norell
,
however
.
She
likes
his
classic
chemise
.
Her
favorite
cocktail_dress
is
a
Norell
,
a
black_and_white
organdy
and
silk
jersey
.
Irene
suits
rate
high
because
they
are
designed
for
her
long-bodied
silhouette
.
She
also
likes
the
femininity
and
charm
of
designs
by
Ceil_Chapman
and
Helen_Rose
.
Balenciaga
is
her
favorite
European
designer
.
``
I
bought
my
first
dress
from
him
when
I
was
still
a
struggling
young_actress
''
,
she
reminisces
.
``
I
like
his
clothes
for
their
drama
and
simplicity
and
appreciate
the
great
impact
he
has
on
fashion
''
.
Black_and_white
is
her
favorite
color
combination
along
with
lively
glowing
pinks
,
reds
,
blues
and
greens
.
Of

After

.
Honors
that
have
come
to
Greer_Garson
are
countless
.
Just
this
April
she
was
nominated

the
seventh
time
for
an
Academy_Award
for
her
portrayal
of
Eleanor_Roosevelt

''
.
She

fine

the
vivid

Back
in
college
,
today
's
handsome
Gander
was
the
only
male
member
of
a
Texas_Tech
class
on
food
.
The
pretty
coeds
must
have
ogled
him
all_day_long
-
but
he
dutifully
kept
his
eye
on
the
gravy
.
Last
October
he
gave
a
public
speech
in
Washington
,
D._C.
entitled
``
Are
Women
Here
to
Stay
''
?
So
you
can
see
that
Gerald_G._Ramsey
,
director
of
SMU
's
food
services
,
is
not
the
ordinary
type
of
craven
,
women-trodden
chef
.
He
is
apt
to
rear_back
and
claim
his
rights
.
RAMSEY
,
as
SMU
's
food
wrangler
,
buys
enough
groceries
to
serve
32000
meals
a
week
.
Tell
that
to
the
little
wife
when
she
moans
at
the
woman
's
burden
!
He
also
dishes_up
3000
snacks
.
And
he
operates
three
cafeterias
in
the
Student_Center
,
along
with
McElvaney_Dining_Hall
and
the
athlete
's
tables
.
Ramsey
,
6
-
3
,
195
and
ruggedly
slim
,
says
,
``
I
can
n't
remember
when
I
did
n't
pester
my
mother
to
teach
me
to
cook
''
.
He
was
in
charge
of
the
Hockaday_School
meals
from
1946
to
1950
,
before
he
moved
to
SMU
.
And
you
'll
notice
that
in
both
places
,
there
are
acres
of
charming
young_ladies
who
with
little
effort
spice_up
any
chow_line
.
What
does
he
feed
his
SMU
football
mastodons
at
the
training
table
?
``
Mostly
meat
and
potatoes
-
they
have
to
have
that
go-go-go
without
getting
too
fat
''
,
says
Ramsey
.
So
he
hides
the
mayonnaise
.
And
to
keep
athletes
'
stomachs
from
getting
jumpy
under
physical
duress
,
he
bans
all
highly
flavored
condiments
.
WHAT
DO
the
pretty
SMU
girls
like
on
their
plates
?
``
Pretty_much
hamburger
,
hotdogs
,
steak
and
,
at
night
,
maybe
pizza
''
,
says
the
handsome
food
expert
.
``
Unfortunately
,
there
is
still
little
demand
for
broccoli
and
cauliflower
''
.
Ramsey
has
stoked
up
Harry_Truman
,
Henry_Cabot_Lodge
,
the
King
of
Morocco
,
Clement_Atlee
and
other
shiny
characters
.
Once
four
Tibetan
monks
,
in
their
saffron
robes
,
filed
through
the
cafeteria
line
.
``
They
are
n't
supposed
to
look
at
women
,
you
know
''
,
Ramsey
recalled
.
``
What
with
all
those
pretty
girls
around
,
they
had
a
hard_time
''
.
Use
one
6
-
ounce
chicken_breast
for
each
guest
.
Salt
and
pepper
each
breast
.
Dip
in
melted
butter
and
roll
in
flour
.
Place
side_by_side
in
a
2
-
inch
deep
baking
pan
.
Bake
slowly
about
one
hour
at
250
-
275
F.
until
lightly
brown
.
Add
enough
warmed
cream
,
seasoned
to
taste
with
onion
juice
,
to
about
half
cover
the
chicken_breasts
.
Bake
slowly
at_least
one-half
hour
longer
.
While
this
is
baking
,
saute
mushrooms
,
fresh
or
canned
,
in
butter
.
Sprinkle
over
top
of
chicken_breasts
.
Serve
each
breast
on
a
thin
slice
of
slow-baked
ham
and
sprinkle
with
Thompson
seedless
grapes
.
(
Leave_off
the
ham
and
you
call
it
Chicken_Pontiac
,
says
Ramsey
.
)
Contemporary
furniture
that_is
neither
Danish
nor
straight-line
modern
but
has
sculptured
pattern
,
many
design
facets
,
warmth
,
dignity
and
an
effect
of
utter
comfort
and
livability
.
That_is
the
goal
of
two
new
collections
being
introduced
in
Dallas
this
month
.
Though
there
has
been
some
avant_garde
indication
that
contemporary
furniture
might
go_back
to
the
boxy
look
of
the
'
20
's
and
'
40
's
,
two
manufacturers
chose
to
take
the
approach
of
the
sophisticated
,
but
warm
look
in
contemporary
.
These
two
,
Heritage
and
Drexel
,
chose
too
not
to
produce
the
exactly
matching
design
for
every
piece
,
but
a
collection
of
correlated
designs
,
each
of_which
could
stand
alone
.
The
Heritage
collection
,
to
be
shown
by
Sanger-Harris
and
Anderson
's
Studio
,
has
perhaps
more
different
types
of
woods
and
decorations
than
any
one
manufacturer
ever
assembled
together
at_one_time
.
Called
Perennian
,
to
indicate
its
lasting
,
good
today
and
tomorrow
quality
,
the
collection
truly
avoids
the
monotony
of
identical
pieces
.
Walnut
,
wormy
chestnut
,
pecan
,
three
varieties
of
burl
,
hand-woven
Philippine
cane
,
ceramic
tiles
,
marble
are
used
to
emphasize
the
feeling
of
texture
and
of
permanence
,
the
furniture
to
fit
into
rooms
with
tiled
floors
,
brick
or
paneled
walls
,
windows
that
bring_in
the
outdoors
.
It
is
a
collection
with
a
custom-design
look
,
offering
simplicity
with
warmth
,
variety
and
vitality
.
The
Drexel
collection
,
called
Composite
,
to
be_shown
by
Titche
's
offers
a
realistic
approach
to
decorating
,
a
mature
modern
that
is
a
variation
of
many
designs
.
Rounded
posts
give
a
soft
,
sculptured
look
,
paneled
doors
have
decorative
burl
panels
or
cane
insets
plus
softening
arches
,
table
tops
are
inlaid
in
Macassar
ebony
or
acacia
.
A
high-legged
buffet
provides
easy-to-reach
serving
,
a
cocktail_table
has
small
snack
tables
tucked
under
each
end
,
recessed
arched
panels
decorate
a
60
-
inch
long
chest
.
An
interesting
approach
to
the
bedroom
is_presented
,
with
a
young
,
basic
,
functional
group
of
chests
,
dressers
and
corner
units
and
a
canted
headboard
.
The
other
bedroom
has
heavier
styling
,
door
fronted
dressers
with
acacia
panels
,
a
poster
bed
or
a
bed
with
arched
acacia
panels
and
matching
mirror
.
Colorful
,
bright
Eastman_Chromspun
fabrics
,
with
the
magenta
,
pink
and
white
tones
predominating
as_well
as
golden
shades
are
used
with
Composite
.
The
fabrics
have
Scotchgard
finish
to
resist
soil
and
wrinkles
.
Design
elements
closely
rooted
to
traditional
forms
but
wearing
a
definite
contemporary
label
keynote
Drexel
's
fall
1961
group
,
Composite
.
The
spider-leg
pedestal
table
has
a
base
finished
in
an
ebony
,
to
set_off
the
lustrous
brown
of
the
walnut
top
.
See-through
design
of
the
chairs
combines
both
the
nostalgic
ladder
back
and
an
Oriental
shoji
flavor
.
To
bring
warmth
to
the
dining_area
,
golden
orange
tones
are
used
in
the
fabrics

western

Decorating
the
ballroom
will
be
the
yellow
rose
of
Texas
,
in
tall
bushes
;
bluebonnets
and
stagecoach
silhouettes
.
There
will
be
a
large
drawing
of
a
sunbonnet
girl
with
eyes
that
flash
at
the
guests
.
