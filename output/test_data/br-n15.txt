Early
in
November
the
clouds
lifted
enough
to
carry_out
the
assigned
missions
.
And
Sweeney_Squadron
put
its
first
marks
on
the
combat
record
.
Every
plane
that
could
fly
was
sent
into
the
air
.
Cricket
took
eight
ships
and
went
south
across
the
Straits
and
along
the
north
coast
of
Mindanao
to
Cagayan
.
Anything
the
enemy
flew
or
floated
was
his
target
.
Fleischman
with
eight
was
to
patrol
the
Leyte_Gulf
area
,
with
his
main
task
to
get
any
kamikaze
before
they
got
to
the
ships
.
Greg
himself
took
two
flights
,
with
Todman
leading
the
second
,
to
patrol
and
look_for
targets
of
opportunities
around
Ormoc
on
the
east
coast
of
Leyte
.
Each
plane
carried
two
five-hundred
pound
bombs
.
A
weapons_carrier
took
Greg
,
Todman
,
Belton
,
Banjo_Ferguson
,
and
Walters
and
the
others
the
two
miles
from
the
bivouac
area
to
the
strip
.
It
was
a
rough
long
ride
through
the
mud
and
pot_holes
.
No
one
had
much
to
say
.
The
sky
glowered
down
at
them
.
There
was
a
feeling
that
this
mission
would
be
canceled
like
all
the
others
and
that
this
muddy
wet
dark
world
of
combat
would
go_on
forever
.
The
truck
dropped
them
off
at
the
various
revetments
spread
through
the
jungle
.
Donovan
snatched
Greg
's
chute
from
him
with
a
belligerent
motion
and
almost
ran
to
the
plane
with_it
.
His
face
was
dark
as
the
sky
above
it
as
he
stood
on
the
wing
and
waited
for
his
pilot
.
Greg
climbed
into
the
cockpit
feeling
as
if
he
had
never
been
in
one
before
.
But
his
hands
and
those
of
Donovan
moved
automatically
adjusting
and
arranging
in
the
check-out
procedure
.
``
I
've
got
her
as
neat
as
I
can
''
,
Donovan
said
,
as
he
dropped
the
straps
of
the
Seton
harness
over
Greg
's
shoulders
.
``
But
this
goddamn
climate
.
It
's
for
carabao
not
airplanes
''
.
``
We
'll
make_out
.
Do
n't
you
worry
,
chief
''
,
Greg
replied
,
wondering
if
he
himself
believed
it
.
``
Yeah
.
See_you
''
,
Donovan
said
as
he
jumped
off
the
wing
.
The
expression
was
his
trade-mark
,
his
open_sesame
to
good_luck
,
and
his
prayer
that
pilot
and
plane
would
always
return
.
At
the
prearranged
time
,
Greg
started
the
engine
and
taxied
out
.
From
the
time
the
chocks
were
pulled
until
the
plane
was
out_of_sight
,
he
knew
Donovan
would
keep
his
back
to
the
strip
.
He
wondered
where
the
superstition
had
originated
that
it
was
bad_luck
for
a
crew
chief
to
watch
his
plane
take_off
on
a
combat_mission
.
Yet
long
before
the
scheduled
time
for
return
,
Donovan
would
be
watching
for
every
speck
in
the
sky
.
Greg
rumbled
down
the
rough
metal
taxi_strip
,
and
one_by_one
the
seven
members
of
his
flight
fell_in
behind
him
.
The
dark
brown
bombs
hanging
under
each
wing
looked
large
and
powerful
.
The
pilots
'
heads
looked
ridiculously
small
.
The
control_tower
gave
him
immediate
take-off
permission
,
and
the
clean
roar
of
the
engine
that
took
him
off
the
rough
strip
spoke
well
of
the
skill
of
Donovan
.
Greg
's
mission
was
the
last
to
leave
,
and
as
he
circled
the
ships
off
Tacloban
he
saw
the
clouds
were
dropping_down
again
.
To
the
west
,
the
dark
green
hills
of
Leyte
were
lost
in
the
clouds
about
halfway
up
their
slopes
.
Underneath
him
the
sea
was
a
dark
and
muddied
gray
.
Water
splashed
against
his
windshield
as
he
led
the
flight
in
and
out
of
showers
.
The
metal
strip
they
had
taken_off
from
was
coal_black
against
the
green
jungle
around
it
.
He
possessed
the
fighter
pilot
's
horror
of
bad_weather
and
instrument_flying
,
and
he
wondered
,
if
the
ceiling
did
drop
,
whether
he
and
the
other
flights
would
be
able
to
find
their
way
back
in_this
unfamiliar
territory
.
He
shivered
in
the
warm
cockpit
.
The
overcast
was
solid
above
him
.
As
far
as
he
could
see
there
was
no
hole
to
climb
through
it
.
They
would
have
to
go
west
through
the
narrow
river
valley
that
separated
Leyte
from
Samar
and
hope
that
it
did
n't
close_in
before
they
returned
.
Greg
pushed
the
radio
button
on
his
throttle
.
``
Todman
,
let
's
try
to
go
under
this
stuff
.
Stay
in
close
and
we
'll
go
up
the
valley
''
.
``
Roger
,
Sweeney
''
,
Todman
called
back
,
and
pulled
his
four
in
and
slightly
above
Greg
.
Greg
took
the
formation
wide
around
three
A-26
attack
bombers
that
were
headed
north
over
the
Gulf
.
He
dropped_down
to
five_hundred
feet
,
swinging
a_little
north
of
the
city
of
Tacloban
,
and
punched
into
the
opening
that
showed
against
the
mountain
.
The
valley
was
only
a_few
hundred
yards
wide
with
just_about
room
enough
for
a
properly
performed
hundred-and-eighty
degree
turn
.
It
was
only
a
fifteen
minute
flight
,
but
before
it
was
through
Greg
felt
himself
developing
a
case
of
claustrophobia
.
The
ceiling
stayed
solid
above
them
at
about
eight
hundred
feet
,
and
at_times
the
sheer
cliffs
seemed
about
to
close_in
.
If
the
other
pilots
were
worried
,
they
did
not
show
it
.
The
formation
remained
perfect
.
When
the
sea
was
visible
ahead
of
them
,
the
relief
was
as
great
as
if
the
sun
had
come_out
.
He
spread
the
flight
out
and
led
them
across
a
point
of
land
and_then
down
the
coast
.
Although
they
drew
light
ground
fire
they
saw
no
signs
of
activity
.
Once
Todman
thought
he
had
spotted
a
tank
and
went_down
to
investigate
while
Greg
covered
him
.
``
Somebody
beat
us
to_it
''
!
Todman
said
over
the
radio
as
he
came_back
up
in
formation
.
Visibility
continued
to
be
limited
,
and
Greg
was
never
able
to
get
above
a_thousand
feet
.
It
was
frustrating
.
His
earphones
were
constantly
full
of
the
sounds
of
enemy
contacts
made
by
other
flights
.
He
thought
once
that
he
identified
the
somewhat
hysterical
voice
of
Fleischman
claiming
a
kill
.
But
Greg
's
area
remained
as
placid
as
a
Florida
dawn
.
Finally
,
as
time
began
to
run_out
,
he
headed
into
Ormoc
and
glide-bombed
a
group
of
houses
that
Intelligence
had
thought
might
contain
Japanese
supplies
.
The
low
clouds
made
bombing
difficult
.
There
was
not
enough
room
to
make
the
usual
vertical
bomb
run
.
The
accuracy
was
deplorable
.
One
of
Greg
's
bombs
hung_up
,
and
he
was
miles
from
the
target
before
he
could
get_rid_of
it
.
Only
one
of
the
flight
scored
a
direct
hit
and
the
rest
blew_up
jungle
.
With
their
load
of
bombs
gone
,
the
planes
moved
swiftly
and
easily
.
Greg
went_up
tight
against
the
ceiling
and
led
them
back
to
their
pass
to
home
.
Mercifully
,
it
was
still
open
.
Like
a
man
making
a
deep
dive
,
Greg
took
full
breath
and
plunged
back
into
the
valley
.
He
was
about
to
make
a
gas
check
on
his
flight
when
Todman
's
voice
broke_in
:
``
Sweeneys
!
Three
bogies
.
Twelve
o'clock
level
''
.
Greg
's
eyes
flicked
up
from
his
instrument_panel
.
He
saw
them
,
specks
against
the
gray
,
but
closing
fast
.
They
were
headed
straight
for
each
other
on
a
collision
course
.
Friend
or
enemy
?
The
same
old
question
.
And
only
a_few
seconds
to
answer
it
.
``
Zeros
''
!
Todman
said
excitedly
,
and
hopefully
.
And_then
he
thought
Todman
might
be
right
.
His
mind
flicked
through
the
mental_pictures
he
had
from
the
hours
of
Aircraft_Identification
.
He
narrowed
the
shape
down
to
two
:
either
a
Zero
or
a
U._S._Navy
type
aircraft
.
If
it
were
the
enemy
,
tactically
his
position
was
correct
.
Japanese
aircraft
were
strong
on
maneuverability
,
American
on
speed
and
firepower
.
His
present
maximum
altitude
,
up
against
the
overcast
,
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
exploit
his
advantages
.
But
it
also
made
him
conspicuous
to
the
enemy
,
if
it
was
the
enemy
,
and
he
had
n't
been
spotted
already
.
But
the
closing
aircraft
showed
no
sign
of
deviating
from
their
original
course
.
In
seconds
,
Greg
made
his
decision
.
He
pushed
the
radio
button
.
``
Sweeney_Blue
,
hit_the_deck
.
Lots
of
throttle
.
Todman
,
you
take
the
one
on
the
left
.
I
'll
take
the
middle
.
Belton
,
the
one
on
the
right
.
If
&
&
&
if
they
're
Japs
.
Let
's
make
sure
first
''
.
Greg
had
the
stick
forward
and
the
throttle
up
before
he
heard
the
two
``
Rogers
''
.
The
planes
,
light
with
most
of
the
gas
burned
out
,
responded
beautifully
.
Greg
's
airspeed
indicator
was
over
350
when
he
leveled_off
just
above
the
trees
.
The
opposing
aircraft
continued
to
come_on
.
They
appeared
to
be
the
enemy
.
Greg
wished
the
Air_Corps
had
continued
to
camouflage
planes
.
There
was
,
of_course
,
no
way
for
the
other
planes
to
get_by
them
.
It
was
a
box
.
But
they
could
turn
and
escape
to
the
east
.
Greg
pushed
the
radio
button
again
.
``
Todman
,
drop
your
second
element
back
.
If
any
of
us
miss
,
they
can
pick_up
the
pieces
.
Now
let
's
make
sure
they
're
Japs
''
.
Even
as
he
said
it
,
Greg
knew
they
had
found
the
enemy
.
The
shapes
were
unmistakable
and
the
Rising
Suns
were
showing_up
,
slightly
brighter
pinpoints
in
the
gray
gloom
.
Greg
slapped
his
hand
across
the
switches
that
turned_on
the
guns
and
gun
camera
and
gun
sight
.
The
circle
with
the
dot
in
the
center
showed_up
yellow
on
the
reflector
glass
in_front
of
him
.
His
hands
shook
.
``
Arm
your
guns
,
Sweeneys
''
.
``
They
're
Japs
.
They
're
Japs
''
,
came
a
high-pitched
voice
.
``
Greg
to
Sweeney_Blue
.
One
pass
only
.
No
turns
.
You
'll
bust_your_ass
in_this
canyon
.
That
's
an
order
''
.
He
moved
the
flights
over
against
one
wall
.
It
gave
them
all
a
chance
to
make
a
high-speed
climbing
turn
attack
and
a
break-away
that
would
not
take
them
into
the
overcast
or
force
a
tight
turn
recovery
.
If
the
turn
was
too
tight
,
a
barrel_roll
would
bring
them
out
.
A
hell
of
an
altitude
for
a
barrel_roll
,
but
it
could
be
done
.
Greg
slammed
his
throttle
to
the
fire_wall
and
rammed
up
the
RPM
,
and
the
engine
responded
as
if
it
had
been
waiting
.
The
clearly
identifiable
enemy
continued
on
as
if
no
one
else
were
around
.
``
They
have
n't
seen
us
''
,
Greg
yelled
to
himself
over
the
engine
noise
.
``
They
have
n't
seen
us
''
.
He
hit
the
radio
button
.
``
Now
,
Sweeneys
,
now
.
Let
's
take
'
em
home
''
.
He
hauled
back
on
the
stick
and
felt
his
cheeks
sag
.
Out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
,
he
watched
his
wingman
move
out
a_bit
and
shoot_up
with
him
.
Perfect
,
he
thought
.
With
the
rapid
rate
of
closure
,
the
approach
from
below
,
the
side
,
and
ahead
,
there
would
be
only
a
moment
when
damage
could
be
done
.
Just
like
shooting
at
a
duck
while
performing
a
half-gainer
from
a
diving_board
.
He
tightened
his
turn
.
His
nose
up
.
It
was
going_to
be
dangerous
.
Eight
aircraft
in_this
small
box
.
Please
,
dear
God
,
make
my
pilots
good
,
he
prayed
.
He
took
a
lead
on
the
enemy
,
using
a
distance
of
five
of
the
radii
in
his
circular
sight
and_then
added
another
.
The
enemy
did
not
veer
.
It
did
not
seem
possible
that
they
had
n't
been
spotted
.
Blind
fools
.
Now
!
Greg
's
fingers
closed
on
the
stick
trigger
.
The
plane
rumbled
and
slowed
.
Six
red
lines
etched
their
way
into
the
gray
and
vanished
.
As
if
drawn
by
a
wire
the
enemy
flew
into
them
.
Greg
tightened
his
turn
until
the
plane
shuddered
.
Luck
was
with
him
.
His
burst
held
for
a
second
on
the
engine
section
of
the
plane
.
The
Jap
's
propeller
flew
off
in
pieces
.
A
large
piece
of
engine
cowling
vanished
.
It
was
all
Greg
had
time
to
see
.
His
maneuvering
for
the
shot
had
placed
him
near
the
overcast
,
almost
inverted
and
heading_up
into
the
clouds
.
His
speed
was
dropping
rapidly
.
If
he
spun
out
now
,
he
would
join
his
opponent
on
the
ground
.
Wingman
,
stay
clear
,
he
prayed
.
He
pushed
stick
and
rudder
and
entered
the
overcast
on
his
back
.
He
fought
the
panic
of
vertigo
.
He
had
no
idea
which
was
up
and
which
was
down
.
He
held
the
controls
where
they
had
been
.
Sweat
popped_out
over
him
and
he
felt
the
slick
between
his
palm
and
the
stick
grip
.
His
air_speed
dropped
until
he
thought
he
would
spin
out
.
