This
was
not
,
for
the
Angel
,
just
a
matter
of
running_through
a
logical
or
deductive
chain
,
or
deciding
on
some
action
from
some
already
established
premise
.
No_doubt
the
Angels
could
do
that
kind_of
thing
as
fast
as
any
computer
.
What
Gabriel
was
being
asked
to
do
now
,
however
,
was
to
re-examine
all
his
basic_assumptions
,
make
value-judgments
on
them
,
and
give
them
new
and
different
powers
in
his
mind
to
govern
his
motives
.
This
is
not
wholly
a
reasoning
process
-
a
computer
cannot
do
it
all
-
and
even
in
an
Angel
it
takes
time
.
(
Or
,
perhaps
,
especially
in
an
Angel
,
whose
assumptions
had
mostly
been
fixed
millions
of
years
ago
.
)
Being
reasonably
sure
of
the
reason
for
the
long
pause
,
however
,
did
not
make
it
seem
any
less
long
to
Jack
.
He
had
already
become
used_to
Hesperus
'
snapping
back
answers
to
questions
almost
before
Jack
could
get
them
asked
.
There
was
nothing
he
could
do
but
wait
.
The
dice
were
cast
.
At_last
Gabriel
spoke
.
``
We
misjudged
you
''
,
he
said
slowly
.
``
We
had
concluded
that
no
race
as
ephemeral
as
yours
could
have
had
time
to
develop
a
sense
of
justice
.
Of_course
we
have
before_us
the
example
of
the
great
races
at
the
galactic
center
;
individually
they
are
nearly
as
mortal
as
you
-
the
difference
does
not
seem
very
marked
to
us
,
where
it
exists
.
But
they
have
survived
for
long
periods
as
races
,
whereas
you
are
young
.
We
shall
recommend
to
them
that
they
shorten
your
trial
period
by
half
.
``
For_now
,
it
is
clear
that
we
were
in
the
wrong
.
You
may
reclaim
your
property
,
and
the
penalty
on
Hesperus
is
lifted
.
Hesperus
,
you
may
speak
''
.
``
I
did
not
perceive
this
essential
distinction
either
,
First-Born
''
,
Hesperus
said
at_once
,
``
I
was
only
practicing
a
concept
that
Jack
taught
me
,
called
a
deal
''
.
``
Nevertheless
,
you
were
its
agent
.
Jack
,
what
is
the
nature
of_this
concept
''
?
``
It
's
a
kind_of
agreement
in_which
each
party
gives
something
to
the
other
''
,
Jack
said
.
``
We
regard
it
as
fair
only
when
each
party
feels
that
what
he
has
received
is
as
valuable
,
or
more
valuable
,
than
what
he
has
given
''
.
His
heart
,
he
discovered
,
was
pounding
.
``
For_instance
,
Hesperus
agreed
to
help
me
find
my
property
,
and
I
agreed
to
take
him
to
Earth
.
Between
individuals
,
this
process
is
called
bargaining
.
When
it
is
done
between
races
or
nations
,
it
is
called
making
a
treaty
.
And
the
major
part
of
my
mission
to
your
nest
is
to
make
a
treaty
between
your
race
and
mine
.
Recovering
the
property
was
much
less
important
''
.
``
Strange
''
,
Gabriel
said
.
``
And
apparently
impossible
.
Though
it
might
be
that
we
would
have
much
to
give
you
,
you
have
nothing
to
give
us
''
.
``
Hesperus
and
Lucifer
''
,
Jack
said
,
``
show
that
we
do
''
.
Another
pause
;
but
this
one
was
not_nearly
as
long
.
``
Then
it
is
a
matter
of
pleasure
;
of
curiosity
;
of
a
more
alive
time
.
Yes
,
those
could
be
commodities
under
this
concept
.
But
you
should
understand
,
Jack
,
that
Hesperus
and
Lucifer
are
not_long
out
of
the
nursery
.
Visiting
the
Earth
would
not
be
an
offering
of
worth
to
those
of
us
who
are
older
''
.
This
explained
a
great_deal
.
``
All
the
more
reason
,
then
''
,
Jack
said
,
``
why
we
must
have
a
treaty
.
We
will
gladly
entertain
your
young
and
give
them
proper
living_quarters
,
in_return
for
their
help
in
running
our
fusion_reactors
.
But
we
must
know
if
this
is
in_accordance_with
your
customs
,
and
must
have
your
agreement
they
will
not
misuse
the
power
we
put
in
their
hands
,
to
our
hurt
''
.
``
But
this
simply
requires
that
they
behave
in_accordance_with
the
dictates
of
their
own
natures
,
and
respect
yours
in_turn
.
To
this
we
of_course
agree
''
.
Jack
felt
a
wave
of
complete
elation
,
but
in
a
second
it
had
vanished
without
a
trace
.
What
Gabriel
was
asking
was
that
mankind
forego
all
its
parochial
moral
judgments
,
and
contract
to
let
the
Angels
serve
on
Earth
as_it_is
in
Heaven
regardless_of
the
applicable
Earth
laws
.
The
Angels
in_turn
would
exercise
similar
restraints
in
respect
for
the
natural
preferences
and
natures
of
the
Earthmen
-
but
they
had
no
faintest
notion
of
man
's
perverse
habit
of
passing
and
enforcing
laws
which
were
contrary
to
his
own
preferences
and
violations
of
his
nature
.
The
simple
treaty
principle
that
Gabriel
was
asking
him
to
ratify
,
in_short
,
was
nothing
less_than
total
trust
.
Nothing
less
would
serve
.
And
it
might
be
,
considering
the
uncomfortable
custom
the
Angels
had
of
thinking_of
everything
in_terms_of
absolutes
,
that
the
proposal
of
anything
less
might
well
amount
instead
to
something
like
a
declaration
of
war
.
Furthermore
,
even
the
highly
trained
law
clerk
who
was
a
part
of
Jack
's
total
make-up
could
not
understand
how
the
principle
could
ever
be
codified
.
Almost
the
whole
experience
of
mankind
pointed
toward
suspicion
,
not
trust
,
as
the
safest
and
sanest
attitude
toward
all
outsiders
.
Yet
there
was
some
precedent
for
it
.
The
history
of
disarmament
agreements
,
for_instance
,
had
been
unreassuringly
dismal
;
but
the
United_States
and
the
Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics
nevertheless
did
eventually
agree
on
an
atomic_bomb
test
ban
,
and
a
sort_of
provisional
acceptance
of
each
other
's
good
intentions
on
this
limited
question
.
Out
of_that
agreement
,
though
not
by
any
easy
road
,
eventually
emerged
the
present
world
hegemony
of
the
United_Nations
;
suspicion
between
member
states
still
existed
,
but
it
was
of
about
the
same
low
order
of
virulence
as
the
twentieth-century
rivalry
between
Arizona
and
California
over
water_supplies
.
Besides
,
agreements
``
in_principle
''
,
with
the
petty
details
to
be
thrashed_out
later
,
were
commonplace
in
diplomatic
history
.
The
trouble
with
them
was
that
they
almost
never
worked
,
and
in_fact
an
agreement
``
in_principle
''
historically
turned_out
to
be
a
sure
sign
that
neither
party
really
wanted
the
quarrel
settled
.
Suppose
that
this
one
were
to
work
?
There
was
no
question
in
Jack
's
mind
of
the
good
faith
on_one_side
,
at_least
.
If
mankind
could
be
convinced
of
that
.
It
was
worth
trying
.
In_fact
,
it
had_to
be
tried
.
It
would
be
at_once
the_most
tentative
and
most
final
treaty
that
Earth
had
ever
signed
.
Secretary_Hart
had
taught
Jack
,
at_least
partially
,
to
be
content
with
small
beginnings
in_all
diplomatic
matters
;
but
there
was
no
small
way
to
handle
this
one
.
He
turned_back
to
the
screens
,
the
crucial
,
conclusive
phrase
on
his
lips
.
But
he
was
too
late
.
He
had
lost
his
audience
.
For
a
moment
he
could
make
no
sense
at_all
of_what
he
saw
.
It
seemed
to
be
only
a
riot
of
color
,
light
and
meaningless
activity
.
Gradually
,
he
realized
that
the
pentagon
of
Angel
elders
had
vanished
,
and
that
the
ritual
learning
dance
of
the
nursery
had
been
broken_up
.
The
Angels
in
the
nursery
were
zigzagging
wildly
in_all_directions
,
seemingly
at_random
.
``
Hesperus
!
What
's
going_on
here
?
What
's
happened
''
?
``
Your
brothers
have
been
found
.
They
are
on
their
way
here
''
.
``
Where
?
I
do
n't
see
them
.
The
instruments
do
n't
show
them
''
.
``
You
can
n't
see
them
yet
,
Jack
.
They
'll
be
in
range
in_a_short_while
''
.
Jack
scanned
the
skies
,
the
boards
,
and
the
skies
again
.
Nothing
.
No
-
there
was
a
tiny
pip
on
the
radar
;
and
it
was
getting
bigger
rapidly
.
If
that
was
the
skiff
,
it
was
making
unprecedented
speed
.
Then
the
skiff
hove
into
sight
,
just
a
dot
of
light
at_first
against
the
roiling
blackness
and
crimson
streaks
of
the
Coal_Sack
.
Through
the
telescope
,
Jack
could
see
that
both
spacesuits
were
still
attached
to
it
.
The
sail
was
still
unfurled
,
though
there
were
a
good
many
holes
in
it
,
as
Langer
had
predicted
would
be
the
case
by
now
.
It
was
a
startling
,
almost
numenous
sight
;
but
even
more
awesome
was
the
fact
that
it
was
trailing
an
enormous
comet
's
-
tail
of
Angels
.
The
skiff
was
not
heading
for
the
nursery
,
however
.
It
seemed
unlikely
that
her
crew
,
if
either
of
them
were
alive
,
could
even
see
the
Ariadne
,
for
they
were
passing
her
at_a_distance
of
nearly
a
light-year
.
And
there
would
be
no
chance
of
signaling
them
-
without
the
Nernst
generator
Jack
could
not
send
a
call
powerful
enough
to
get_through
all
the
static
,
and
by
the
time
he
could
rebuild
his
fusion
power
the
skiff
would
be
gone
.
Fuming
,
helpless
,
he
watched
them
pass
him
.
The
sail
,
ragged
though
it
was
,
still
had
enough
surface
to
catch
some
of
the
ocean
of
power
being
poured_out
from
the
nursery
stars
.
He
would
never
have
believed
,
without
seeing
it
,
that
the
bizarre
little
vessel
could
go
so
fast
.
But
where
was
it
going
?
And
why
was
it
causing
so_much
agitation
among
the
Angels
,
and
being
followed
by
so
many_of
them
?
There
was
only
one
possible
answer
,
but
Jack
's
horrified
mind
refused
to
believe
it
until
he
had
fed
the
radar
plots
of
the
skiff
's
course
into
the
computer
.
The
curve
on
the
card
the
computer
spat
back
at
him
could
n't
be
argued
with
,
however
.
The
skiff
was
headed
for
the
very
center
of
the
nebula
-
toward
that
place
which
,
Jack
knew
now
,
could
hold
nothing
less
important
than
the
very
core
of
the
Angel
's
life
and
religion
.
It
was
clear
that
Langer
had
at_last
found
a
way
to
attract
the
Angel
's
attention
.
It
was
equally
clear
that
as
of_this
moment
,
the
treaty
was
off
.
Langer
would
have
to
be
headed_off
,
whether
he
knew
where
he
was
going
or
not
.
Almost
surely
he
did
;
after_all
,
he
had
had
the
same
set
of
facts
as
Jack
had
had
to
work
from
,
and
he
was
an
almost
frighteningly
observant
man
.
But
not
having
talked
to
the
Angels
,
he
had
made
a
wrong
turn
in
his
reasoning
somewhere
along
the
line
.
Had
he
decided
,
perhaps
,
that
the
center
of
the
cloud
was
a
center
of
government
,
instead
of
a
center
of
life
and
faith
``
?
But
it
did
n't
matter
now
whether
he
meant
to
invade
the
Holy_of_Holies
,
or
was
simply
headed
in_that
direction
by_accident
.
If
it
was
intentional
,
it
was
now
also
unnecessary
;
and
whether
intentional
or
not
,
the
outcome
would
be
disastrous
.
Jack
crawled
under
the
boards
and
restored
the
six
feet
of
lead_line
he
had
excised
from
the
Nernst
generator
switch
.
When
he
was
back
on
his
feet
again
and
about
to
reinstall
the
fuses
,
however
,
he
hesitated
.
He
had
to
have
fusion
power
to
catch_up_with
the
skiff
,
and
he
had
to
have
it
fast
.
But
fusion
power
in
the
Coal_Sack
was
what
had
triggered
all
the
trouble
in_the_first_place
-
and
he
already
had
an
Angel
aboard
.
``
Hesperus
''
?
``
Receiving
''
.
``
I
'm
going_to
turn
my
generator
back
on
,
as
I
promised
to
do
.
But
I
can
n't
take
you
to
Earth
yet
.
First
I
've
got_to
intercept
my
brothers
before
they
get
any
deeper
into
trouble
.
Will
you
obstruct
this
,
or
will
you
help
?
I
know
it
's
not
part
of
the
bargain
,
and
your
elders
might
not
like
it
''
.
``
Nobody
else
can
live
in
your
hearth
while
I
am
in
it
''
,
Hesperus
said
promptly
.
``
As
for
my
elders
,
they
have
already
admitted
that
they
were
wrong
.
If
because
of_this
incident
they
become
angry
with
Earth
,
I
will
not
be
permitted
to
go
there
at_all
.
Therefore
of_course
I
will
help
''
.
With
a
short-lived
sigh
of
relief
,
Jack
plugged
the
fuses
back
in
and
threw
the
switch
.
Without
an
instant
's
transition
,
the
green_light
that
meant
full
fusion
power
winked
on
the
board
.
Always
before
,
it
had
taken
five
minutes
to
-
Of_course
.
Hesperus
was
in
there
.
From
here
on
out
,
the
Ariadne
was
going_to
be
hotter
than
any
space
cruiser
man
had
ever
dreamed
of
.
But
since
he
had
failed
to
anticipate
it
,
he
lost
the
five
minutes
anyhow
,
in
plotting
an
intercept
orbit
.
``
Hesperus
,
do
n't
use
this
t-tau
vector
trick
of
yours
,
please
.
