The
Brannon
outfit
-
known
as
the
Slash-B
because
of
its
brand
-
reached
Hondo_Creek
before
sundown
.
The
herd
was
watered
and_then
thrown
onto
a
broad
grass
flat
which
was
to
be
the
first
night
's
bedground
.
Two
of
the
new
hands
,
a
Mexican
named
Jose_Amado
and
a
kid
known
only
as
Laredo
,
were
picked
for
the
first
trick
of
riding
night
herd
.
The
rest
of
the
crew
offsaddled
their
mounts
and
turned
them
into
the
remuda
.
They
got
tin
cups
of
coffee
from
the
big
pot
on
the
coosie
's
fire
,
rolled
and
lighted
brown
paper
cigarettes
,
lounged_about
.
There
was
some
idle_talk
,
a
listless
discussion
of
this
or
that
small
happening
during
the
day
's
drive
.
But
they
deliberately
avoided
the
one
subject
that
had
them
all
curious
:
the
failure
of
the
boss
's
wife
and
son
to
join
the
outfit
.
It
especially
bothered
the
older
hands
.
The
cook
,
Mateo_Garcia
,
had
arrived
there
long
before
the
herd
.
He
'd
started
a
fire
and
put
coffee
on
,
and
now
was
busy
at
the
work_board
of
his
chuck_wagon
.
He
was
readying
a
batch
of
sourdough
biscuits
for
the
Dutch_oven
.
Supper
would
be
ready
within
the
hour
.
The
Maguire
family
was
setting_up
a
separate
camp
nearby
.
Billie
had
unhitched
the
mules
from
both
Tom_Brannon
's
and
his
father
's
wagon
.
Hank
had
gathered
wood
for
a
cookfire
,
and
his
wife
was
busy
at
it
now
.
Conchita
kept_an_eye_on
the
twins
and
little
Elena
,
trying
to
keep
them
from
falling
into
the
creek
by
which
they
persisted
in
playing
.
Conchita
nagged
at
the
younger
children
,
attempting
without
success
to
keep
her
thoughts
off
Tom_Brannon
.
Tom_Brannon
had
caught_up_with
the
outfit
shortly
after
the
Maguires
joined
it
,
which
had
been
at
midday
.
He
'd
come
alone
,
without
his
wife
and
child
.
He
'd
been
in
an
angry
mood
:
Conchita
had
thought
his
face
almost
ugly
with
the
anger
in
him
.
She
wondered
what
had
taken_place
in
town
,
between
him
and
his
wife
.
She
wished
that
she
could
talk
to
her
mother
about
it
.
Not
that
her
mother
knew
what
had
happened
,
but
they
could
speculate
upon
it
.
But
her
mother
would
rebuke
her
if
she
mentioned
it
,
and
say
that
it
was
none
of
her
concern
.
``
Pat
,
get_out
of
that
creek
!
You
too
,
Sean
!
Elena
,
you
'll
get
mud
all_over
your
dress
''
!
Even
as
she
called
to
the
children
,
Conchita
let
her
gaze
seek
Tom_Brannon
.
Tomas
,
she
called
him
-
as
the
Mexican
hands
did
.
He
was
in
earnest
conversation
with
her
father
and
the
old
vaquero
,
Luis_Hernandez
.
Whatever
they
are
talking_about
?
Conchita
wondered
.
It
bothered
her
that
she
probably
would
never
know
.
Certainly
,
she
would
n't
dare
ask
her
father
afterward
.
He
would
tell
her
not
to
pry
into
grownups
'
affairs
-
as
though
she
were
a
little
kid
like
Elena
!
At
the
moment
,
the
three
men
were
not
saying
much
of
anything
.
They
were
sitting
on
their
heels
,
rider
fashion
,
over
by
the
still
empty
calf
wagon
.
Brannon
was
hunkered_down
with
his
broad
back
to
the
left
rear
wheel
,
with
the
other
two
facing
him
.
He
held
a
cigarette
in
his
right_hand
.
It
was
burning
away
,
forgotten
.
His
face
was
clouded
with
unhappiness
.
He
'd
told
Hank_Maguire
and
Luis_Hernandez
about
his
wife
's
refusal
to
come_with
him
and
about
what
he
now
intended
to
do
.
They
were
considering
it
gravely
,
neither
seeming
to
like
what
he
planned
.
Finally
Hernandez
said
,
``
I
could
offer
you
advice
,
Tomas
,
but
you
would
n't
heed
it
''
.
``
Let
's
hear
it
,
anyway
''
.
``
Wait
a
little
while
.
Let
Senora_Brannon
live
in
her
father
's
house
for
a
time
.
Give
her
time
to
miss
you
.
Maybe
she
will
then
come
to
you
.
After_all
,
you
want
the
senora
as_much_as
you
want
the
boy
.
You
need
her
even
more_than
you
need
him
''
.
``
She
won
n't
change
her
mind
''
,
Brannon
said
.
``
John_Clayton
will
see
to
that
''
.
``
But
after
a
time
away
from
you
&
&
&
''
.
``
A
year
,
Luis
?
Five
?
Ten
?
How
long
should
I
wait
''
?
``
Maybe
in
a
year
,
Tomas
&
&
&
''
.
``
In
a
year
she
'll
like
living
in
Clayton
's
house
too_much
to
come_back
to
me
''
,
Brannon
said
flatly
.
``
And
the
boy
will
be
too_much
under
his
influence
by
then
.
I
've
got_to
take
Danny
away
from
Clayton
before
I
lose
him
altogether
.
Hell
,
in
a
year
or
five
or
ten
,
the
boy
will
have
forgotten
me
-
his
own
father
''
!
``
But
to
take
him
and
leave
his
mother
behind
is
not
good
''
.
``
In
my
place
,
you
'd
follow
such
advice
as
you
give
me
''
?
Hernandez
looked
suddenly
uncertain
.
``
That
I
can
n't
answer
,
for
I
can
n't
imagine
something
like
this
happening
to
me
.
Maybe
I
should
withdraw
my
advice
-
no
''
?
Brannon
looked
at
Hank_Maguire
.
``
And
you
?
What
would
you
do
in
my
place
''
?
Hank
shook
his
head
.
``
I
do
n't
know
,
Tom
.
Like
Luis
,
I
can
n't
see
something
like
this
happening
to
me
.
With
Maria
and
me
,
there
's
never
any
problem
.
Where
I
go
,
she
goes
-
and
the
kids
with
us
.
You
're
going_to
need
your
woman
.
And
the
boy
will
need
his
mother
.
If
you
take
the
one
,
you
'd_better
take
both
''
.
Brannon
shook
his
head
.
``
I
won
n't
force
Beth
to
come
against
her
will
.
But
I
'm
going_to
have
my
son
''
.
They
were
silent
for
a
little
while
,
each
looking
glum
.
Finally
Luis_Hernandez
said
,
``
What_must_be_,_must_be
.
I
am
with
you
,
of_course
,
Tomas
''
.
And
Hank_Maguire
added
,
``
So
am
I
,
Tom
''
.
``
All_right
''
,
Brannon
said
,
rising
.
``
We
'll
ride
out
as_soon_as
we
've
had
chuck
''
.
Brannon
timed
it
so
that
they
rode
in
an
hour
after
nightfall
.
They
had
for
cover
both
darkness
and
a
summer
storm
.
During
much
of
the
fifteen
mile
ride
they
had
watched
a
lurid
display
of
lightning
in
the
sky
to
the
east
.
Later
,
they
'd
heard
the
rumble
of
thunder
and_then
,
just
outside
Rockfork
,
they
ran_into
rain
.
Those
who
had
slickers
donned
them
.
The
others
put_on
old
coats
or
ducking
jackets
,
whichever
they
carried
behind
their
saddle
cantles
.
There
were
seven
of
them
,
enough
for
a
show
of
strength
-
to
run
a
bluff
.
It
was
to
be
nothing
more_than
that
.
There
was
to
be
no
gunplay
.
If
the
bluff
failed
and
they
ran_into
trouble
,
Brannon
had
told
the
others
,
they
would
withdraw
-
and
he
would
come
after
his
son
another
time
.
He
did
n't
want
to
put
himself
outside
the
law
.
With
him
were
Hank_Maguire
,
Luis_Hernandez
,
and
Luis
's
son
Pedro
.
The
Ramirez
brothers
were
also
along
.
The
seventh
man
was
Red_Hogan
,
a
wiry
little
puncher
with
a
wild
streak
and
a
liking
for
hell_raising
.
They
were
all
good
men
.
It
was
dark
early
,
because
of
the
storm
.
Also
because
of
the
storm
,
the
streets
of
Rockfork
were
deserted
.
Lighted
windows
glowed
jewel
bright
through
the
downpour
.
They
reined_in
before
the
town
marshal
's
office
,
a
box
sized
building
on
Main_Street
.
A
lamp
burned
inside
,
but
Brannon
,
peering
through
the
window
,
saw
that
the
office
was
empty
.
He
'd
hoped
to
catch
Jesse_Macklin
there
.
``
Probably
just
stepped_out
''
,
he
said
.
``
Maybe
to
have
supper
.
Red
,
come
along
.
The
rest
of
you
wait
here
''
.
With
Red_Hogan
,
he
rode
to
the
Welcome_Cafe
.
Hogan
got_down
from
the
saddle
and
had_a_look
inside
.
``
Not
there
''
,
he
said
,
getting
back
onto
his
horse
.
``
Maybe
he
's
at
the
hotel
''
.
They
rode
to
the
Rockfork_House
,
a_little
farther
along
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
.
They
reined_in
there
,
Brannon
remaining
in
the
saddle
while
Hogan
went
to
look_for
Jesse_Macklin
in
the
hotel
dining_room
.
Brannon
had
no
slicker
.
He
'd
put_on
his
old
brown
corduroy
coat
and
it
was
already
soaked
.
But
he
felt
no
physical
discomfort
.
He
was
only
vaguely
aware
of
the
sluicing
rain
.
He
hardly
noticed
the
blue
green
flashes
of
lightning
and
the
hard
claps
of
thunder
.
Hogan
reappeared
,
stopped
on
the
hotel
porch
,
lifted
a
hand
in
signal
.
Brannon
dismounted
and
climbed
the
steps
.
``
He
's
finished
eating
''
,
Hogan
said
.
``
Sitting
with
a
cup
of
coffee
now
.
It
should
n't
be
long
''
.
It
seemed
long
,
at_least
to
Tom_Brannon
.
He
and
Hogan
waited
by
the
door
,
one
to
either
side
.
Macklin
was
the
third
man
to
come_out
,
and
he
came
unhurriedly
.
He
was
puffing
on
a
cigar
,
and
he
was
turning_up
his
coat
collar
against
the
rain
.
It
was
not
until
he
moved
across
the
porch
that
he
became
aware
of
them
,
and_then
it
was
too
late
.
They
closed_in
fast
,
kept
him
from
reaching
inside
his
coat
for
his
gun
.
``
Just
come
along
''
,
Brannon
told
him
.
``
Do
n't
start
anything
you
can
n't
finish
''
.
``
Now
,
listen
''
-
Macklin
began
.
``
We
'll
talk
over
at
your
office
''
.
``
Brannon
,
I
warn
you
''
!
``
Let
's
go
,
Marsh_al
''
,
Brannon
said
,
and
took
him
by
the
arm
.
Hogan
gripped
the
lawman
's
other
arm
.
They
escorted
him
down
from
the
porch
and
through
the
rain
to
his
office
.
The
other
five
Slash-B
men
followed
them
inside
,
crowding
the
small
room
.
His
face
was
stiff
with
anger
when
they
let_go_of
his
arms
.
He
looked
at
each
of
them
in_turn
,
Brannon
last
of
all
.
``
I
'll
remember
you
''
,
he
said
.
``
Every_last
one
of
you
.
As
for
you
,
Brannon
''
-
``
Put
your
gun
on
the
desk
,
Marshal
''
.
``
Now
,
hold_on
,
damn_it
;
I
won
n't
''
-
Red_Hogan
's
patience
ran_out
.
He
lifted
the
skirt
of
Macklin
's
coat
,
took
his
gun
from
its
holster
,
tossed
it
onto
the
desk
.
``
Too_much
fooling_around
''
,
he
said
.
``
Do
n't
press_your_luck
,
badge
toter
''
.
Brannon
said
,
``
Now
the
key
to
the
lockup
,
Marshal
''
.
``
Key
''
?
Macklin
said
.
``
What
for
''
?
``
Ca
n't
you
guess
''
?
Brannon
said
.
``
We
're
putting
you
where
you
won
n't
come
to
harm
.
Come_on
-
the
key
.
Get
it
out
''
!
``
Damned
if
I
will
.
Brannon
,
you
've
assaulted
a
law_officer
and
''
-
They
moved_in_on
him
,
crowded
him
from
all
sides
.
No
man
laid
a
hand
on
him
,
but
the
threat
of
violence
was
there
.
His
face
took_on
a
sudden
pallor
,
became
beaded
with
sweat
,
and
he
seemed
to
have
trouble
with
his
breathing
.
He
held_out
a
moment
longer
,
then
his
nerve
gave
under
the
pressure
.
He
swore
,
and
said
,
``
All_right
.
It
's
here
in
my
pocket
''
.
``
Get
it
out
''
,
Brannon
ordered
.
Then
,
as
Macklin
obeyed
:
``
Now
let
's
go
out
back
''
.
Resignedly
,
Macklin
turned
to
the
back
door
.
They
followed
him
into
the
rain
and
across
to
the
squat
stone
building
fifty
feet
to
the
rear
.
The
door
of
the
lockup
was
of
oak
planks
and
banded
with
strap
iron
.
It
was
secured
by
an
oversized
padlock
.
Macklin
balked
again
,
not
wanting
to
unlock
and
open
the
door
.
They
crowded
him
in
that
threatening
way
once_more
,
forced
him
to
give_in
.
Once
the
door
was
open
,
they
crowded
him
inside
the
dark
building
.
He
was
uttering
threats
in
a
low
but
savage
voice
when
they
closed
and
padlocked
the
door
.
They
returned
to
the
street
,
mounted
their
horses
,
rode
through
the
rain
to
the
big
house
on
Houston_Street
.
Its
windows
glowed
with
lamplight
.
Deputy_Marshal_Luke_Harper
still
stood_guard
on
the
veranda
,
a
forlorn
,
scarecrowish
figure
in
the
murky
dark
.
He
came
to
the
edge
of
the
veranda
,
peered
down
at
them
with
his
hand
on
his
gun
.
``
Do
n't
try
it
''
,
Brannon
told
him
,
dismounting
and
starting
up
the
steps
with
his
men
following
.
``
Do
n't
get
yourself
killed
for
something
that
does
n't
concern
you
''
.
He
strode
past
the
now
frightened
man
,
entered
the
house
.
Miguel
and
Arturo_Ramirez
remained
on
the
veranda
to
keep
Harper
from
interfering
.
The
others
followed
Brannon
inside
.
They
trailed
him
across
the
wide
hallway
to
the
parlor
,
four
roughly
garbed
and
tough
looking
men
who
probably
had
never
before
ventured
into
such
a
house
.
They
brought
to
it
all
the
odors
that
clung
to
men
like
themselves
,
that
of
their
own
sweat
,
of
campfire
smoke
,
of
horses
and
cattle
.
They
tracked
mud
on
the
oaken
floor
,
on
the
carpet
.
Their
presence
fouled
the
elegance
of
that
room
.
And
their
arrival
caught
John_Clayton
and
Charles_Ansley
off_guard
.
