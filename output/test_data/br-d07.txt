``
The
Lord
is
my
light
and
my
salvation
;
whom
shall
I
fear
?
the
Lord
is
the
strength
of
my
life
;
of
whom
shall
I
be
afraid
''
?
Psalm
27
:
1
A
certain
teacher
scheduled
a
``
Fear
Party
''
for
her
fourth
grade
pupils
.
It
was
a
session
at
which
all
the
youngsters
were
told
to
express
their
fears
,
to
get
them
out
in_the_open
where
they
could
talk_about
them
freely
.
The
teacher
thought
it
was
so
successful
that
she
asks
:
``
Would
n't
it
be
helpful
to
all
age_groups
if
they
could
participate
in
a
similar
confessional
of
their
fears
and
worries
''
?
Dr._George_W._Crane
,
a
medical
columnist
,
thinks
it
would
.
He
says
:
``
That
would
reduce
neurotic
ailments
tremendously
.
Each_week
an
estimated
20
million
patients
call_upon
us
doctors
.
Of_this
number
,
50
%
,
or
10
million
patients
have
no
diagnosable
physical
ailments
whatever
.
They
are
'
worry_warts
'
.
Yet
they
keep
running
from
one
physician
to
another
,
largely
to
get
a
willing
ear
who
will
listen
to
their
parade
of
troubles
.
One
of
the_most
wholesome
things
you
could
schedule
in
your
church
would
thus
be
a
group
confessional
where
people
could
admit
of
their
inner
tensions
''
.
We
are
evidently
trying
hard
to
think_of
new
ways
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
fear
these
days
.
It
must
be
getting
more
serious
.
People
are
giving
their
doctors
a
hard_time
.
One
doctor
made
a
careful
survey
of
his
patients
and
the
reasons
for
their
troubles
,
and
he
reported
that
40
%
of
them
worried
about
things
that
never
happened
;
30
%
of
them
worried
about
past
happenings
which
were
completely
beyond
their
control
;
12
%
of
them
worried
about
their
health
,
although
their
ailments
were
imaginary
;
10
%
of
them
worried
about
their
friends
,
neighbors
,
and
relatives
,
most_of
whom
were
quite
capable_of
taking
care
of
themselves
.
Only
8
%
of
the
worries
had
behind
them
real
causes
which
demanded
attention
.
Well
,
most_of
our
fears
may
be
unfounded
,
but
after
you
discover
that
fact
,
you
have
something
else
to
worry
about
:
Why
then
do
we
have
these
fears
?
What
is
the
real
cause
of
them
?
What
is
there
about
us
that
makes
us
so
anxious
?
Look_at
the
things
we
do
to
escape
our
fears
and
to
forget
our
worries
.
We
spend
millions
of
dollars
every_year
on
fortune_tellers
and
soothsayers
.
We
spend
billions
of
dollars
at
the
race
tracks
,
and
more
billions
on
other
forms
of
gambling
.
We
spend
billions
of
dollars
on
liquor
,
and
many_more
billions
on
various
forms
of
escapist
entertainment
.
We
consume
tons
of
aspirin
and
tranquilizers
and
sleeping_pills
in_order_to
get
a
moment
's
relief
from
the
tensions
that
are
tearing
us
apart
.
A
visitor
from
a
more
peaceful
country
across
the
sea
was
taken
to
one
of
our
amusement_parks
,
and
after
he
had
seen
it
all
,
he
said
to
a
friend
:
``
You
must
be
a
very
sad
people
''
.
``
Sad
''
was
not
the
right
word
,
of_course
.
He
should
have
said
``
jittery
''
,
for
that
's
what
we
are
.
And
that
's
worse
than
sad
.
Watch
people
flock
to
amusement
houses
,
cocktail_lounges
,
and
night
clubs
that
advertise
continuous
entertainment
,
which
means
an
endless
flow
of
noise
and
frivolity
by
paid
entertainers
who
are
supposed
to
perform
in
those
incredible
ways
which
are
designed
to
give
men
a_few
hours
of
dubious
relaxation
-
watch
them
and
you
can
tell
that
many_of
them
are
running_away
from
something
.
In
one
of
his
writings
Pascal
speaks
of_this
mania
for
diversion
as
being
a
sign
of
misery
and
fear
which
man
cannot
endure
without
such
opiates
.
Yes
,
and
as
tension
mounts
in_this
world
,
fear
is
increasing
.
Does
that
explain
why
there
is
now
such
a
big
boom
in
the
bomb_shelter
business
?
We
have
so
many
new
things
to
fear
in_this
age
of
nuclear_weapons
,
dreadful
things
which
are
too
horrible
to
contemplate
.
I
doubt
that
``
fear
parties
''
and
``
group
confessionals
''
will
help
very_much
.
Suppose
we
do
get
our
fears
out
in_the_open
,
what
then
?
Is
n't
that
where
most_of
them
are
already
-
right
out
on
the
front
page
of
our
newspapers
?
Maybe
we
are
talking_about
them
too_much
.
The
question
is
:
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
them
?
Meanwhile
,
the
enemy
will
capitalize
on
our
fears
,
if
he
can
.
Hitler
did
just
that
23
years
ago
,
building_up
tensions
that
first
led
to
a
Munich
and_then
to
a
world_war
.
The
fear
of
war
can
make
us
either
too
weak
to
stand
and
too
willing
to
compromise
,
or
too
reckless
and
too
nervous
to
negotiate
for
peace
as
long
as
there
is
any
chance
to
negotiate
.
It
is
said
that
fear
in
human_beings
produces
an
odor
that
provokes
animals
to
attack
.
It
could
have
the
same
effect
on
Communists
.
The
President_of_the_United_States
has
said
:
``
We
will
never
negotiate
out
of
fear
,
and
we
will
never
fear
to
negotiate
''
.
That
is
a
sound
position
,
but
it
is
important
that
Moscow
shall
recognize
it
not
merely
as
the
word
of
a
president
but
as
the
mind
of
a
free
people
who
are
not
afraid
.
And
that
's
another
reason
why
it
is
imperative
for
us
these
days
to
conquer
our
fears
,
to
develop
the
poise
that
promotes
peace
.
Turning_to
the
Word_of_God
,
we
find
the
only
sure
way
to
do
that
.
In
Psalm
27
:
1
you
read
those
beautiful
words
which
you
must
have
in
your
heart
if
you
are
to
master
the
fears
that
surround
you
,
or
to
drive
them
out
if
they
have
you
in
their
grip
:
``
The
Lord
is
my
light
and
my
salvation
;
whom
shall
I
fear
?
the
Lord
is
the
strength
of
my
life
;
of
whom
shall
I
be
afraid
''
?
Well
,
you
say
,
those
are
beautiful
words
all_right
,
but
it
was
easy
for
the
psalmist
to
sing
them
in
his
day
.
He
did
n't
live
in
a
world
of
perpetual
peril
like
ours
.
He
did
n't
know
anything
about
the
problems
we
face
today
.
No
?
Read
the
next
two
verses
:
``
When
the
wicked
,
even
mine
enemies
and
my
foes
,
came
upon
me
to
eat_up
my
flesh
,
they
stumbled
and
fell
.
Though
an
host
should
encamp
against
me
,
my
heart
shall
not
fear
:
though
war
should
rise
against
me
,
in_this
will
I
be
confident
''
.
That_is
almost
a
perfect
description
of
the
predicament
in_which
we
find
ourselves
today
,
is
n't
it
?
Our
enemy
is
also
threatening
to
devour
us
.
He
has
already
devoured
huge
areas
of
the
world
,
putting
men
behind
concrete
walls
and
iron_curtains
and
barbed_wire
,
reducing
them
to
slavery
,
systematically
crushing
not_only
their
bodies
but
their
souls
,
and
shooting
them
to
death
if
they
try
to
escape
their
prison
.
Yes
indeed
,
we
too
can
see
a
warlike
host
of
infidels
encamped
against
us
.
What
a
terrible
thing
,
that
``
wailing_wall
''
in
Berlin
!
A
man
with
a
baby
in
his
arms
stood
there
pleading
for
his
wife
who
is
on
the
other
side
with
the
rest
of
the
family
.
Another
man
tried
to
swim
across
the
river
from
the
East
to
the
West
,
but
was
shot
and
killed
.
A
middle
aged
woman
opened
a
window
on
the
third
floor
of
her
house
which
was
behind
the
wall
,
she
threw_out
a_few
belongings
and_then
jumped
;
she
was
fatally
injured
.
The
entrance
to
a
church
has
been
walled_up
,
so_that
the
congregation
,
most_of
which
is
in
the
western
sector
,
cannot
worship
God
there
anymore
.
Practically
everybody
in
Berlin
has
relatives
and
friends
that
live
in
the
opposite
part
of
the
city
.
People
stand
at
the
wall
giving_vent
to
their
feelings
,
weeping
,
pounding
it
with
their
fists
,
pleading
for
loved_ones
.
But
the
enemy
answers
them
from
loudspeakers
that
pour
out
Communist
propaganda
with
a
generous
mixture
of
terrible
profanity
.
There
is
only
one
escape
left
,
a
tragic
one
,
and
too
many
people
are
taking
it
:
suicide
.
The
normal
rate
of
suicides
in
East_Berlin
was
one
a
day
,
but
since
the
border
was
closed
on
August
13
it
has
jumped
to
25
a
day
!
These
things
may
be
happening
many
miles
away
from
us
but
really
they
are
right
next_door
.
We
are
all
involved
in
them
,
deeply
involved
.
And
nobody
knows
what
comes
next
.
We
live
from
crisis
to
crisis
.
And
there
is
only
one
way
for
a
man
to
conquer
his
fears
in
such
a
world
.
He
must
learn
to
say
with
true
faith
what
the
psalmist
said
in
a
similar
world
:
``
The
Lord
is
my
light
and
my
salvation
;
whom
shall
I
fear
?
the
Lord
is
the
strength
of
my
life
;
of
whom
shall
I
be
afraid
''
?
Notice
that
this
man
had
a
threefold
conception
of
God
which
is
the
secret
of
his
faith
.
First
,
``
the
Lord
is
my
light
''
.
He
lived
in
a
very
dark
world
,
but
he
was
not
in
the
dark
.
The
same
God
who
called
this
world
into
being
when
He
said
:
``
Let
there
be
light
''
!
-
those
were
His
very
first
creative
words
-
He
began
the
world
with
light
-
this
God
still
gives
light
to
a
world
which
man
has
plunged
into
darkness
.
For
those
who
put
their
trust
in
Him
He
still
says
every_day
again
:
``
Let
there
be
light
''
!
And
there
is
light
!
In_fact
,
He
came
into
this
world
Himself
,
in
the
person
of
His
Son
,
Jesus_Christ
,
who
stood
here
amid
the
darkness
of
human
sin
and
said
:
``
I
am
the
light
of
the
world
:
he
that
followeth
me
shall
not
walk
in_darkness
,
but
shall
have
the
light
of
life
''
.
The
psalmist
could
say
that
God
was
his
light
even_though
he
could
only
anticipate
the
coming
of
Christ
.
He
lived
in
the
dawn
;
he
could
only
see
the
light
coming
over
the
horizon
.
We
live
in
the
bright
daylight
of_that
great
event
;
for
us
it
is
a
fact
in
history
.
Why
should
we
not
have
the
same
faith
,
and
an
even
greater
experience
of
the
light
which
it
gives
?
This
is
the
faith
that
moved
the
psalmist
to
add
his
second
conception
of
God
:
``
The
Lord
is
my
salvation
''
.
He
knew
that
his
God
would
save
him
from
his
enemies
because
He
had
saved
him
from
his
sins
.
If
God
could
do
that
,
He
could
do
anything
.
The
enemies
at
his
gate
,
threatening
to
eat_up
his
flesh
,
were
nothing
compared
with
the
enemy
of
sin
within
his
own
soul
.
And
God
had
conquered
that
one
by
His
grace
!
So
why
worry
about
all
the
others
?
The
apostle
Paul
said
the
same
thing
in
the
language
and
faith
of
the
New_Testament
:
``
He
that
spared
not
His
own
Son
,
but
delivered
Him
up
for
us
all
,
how
shall
He
not
with
Him
freely
give
us
all
things
?
If
God
be
for
us
,
who
can
be
against
us
?
Who
shall
separate
us
from
the
love
of
Christ
?
shall
tribulation
,
or
distress
,
or
persecution
,
or
famine
,
or
nakedness
,
or
peril
,
or
sword
''
?
(
Romans
8
:
31
,
32
,
35
)
Salvation
!
This
is
the
key
to
the
conquest
of
fear
.
This
gets
down
to
the
heart
of
our
problem
,
for
it
reconciles
us
with
God
,
whom
we
fear
most_of_all
because
we
have
sinned
against
Him
.
When
that
fear
has
been
removed
by
faith
in
Jesus_Christ
,
when
we
know
that
He
is
our
Savior
,
that
He
has
paid
our
debt
with
His
blood
,
that
He
has
met
the
demands
of
God
's
justice
and
thus
has
turned
His
wrath
away
-
when
we
know
that
,
we
have
peace
with
God
in
our
hearts
;
and_then
,
with
this
God
on
our
side
,
we
can
face
the
whole
world
without_fear
.
And
so
the
psalmist
gives
us
one
more
picture
of
God
:
``
The
Lord
is
the
strength
of
my
life
''
.
The
word
is
really
``
stronghold
''
.
It
recalls
those
words
of
another
psalm
:
``
God
is
our
refuge
and
strength
,
a
very
present
help
in_trouble
.
Therefore
will
not
we
fear
,
though
the
earth
be
removed
,
and
though
the
mountains
be
carried
into
the
midst
of
the
sea
.
Come
,
behold
the
works
of
the
Lord
,
what
desolations
He
hath
made
in
the
earth
.
