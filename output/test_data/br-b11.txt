California_Democrats
this
weekend
will
take
the
wraps
off
a
1962
model
statewide
campaign
vehicle
which
they
have
been
quietly
assembling
in
a_thousand
district
headquarters
,
party
clubrooms
and
workers
'
backyards
.
They
seem
darned
proud_of
it
.
And
they
're
confident
that
the
GOP
,
currently
assailed
by
dissensions
within
the
ranks
,
will
be
impressed
by
the
purring
power
beneath
the
hood
of_this
grassroots-fueled
machine
.
Their
meeting
at
San_Francisco
is
nominally
scheduled
as
a
conference
of
the
California_Democratic_Council
directorate
.
But
it
will
include
200
-
odd
officeholders
,
organization
leaders
and
``
interested
party
people
''
.
Out
of_this
session
may
come
:
Plans
for
a
dramatic
,
broad-scale
party
rally
in
Los_Angeles
next
December
that
would
enlist
top-drawer
Democrats
from
all_over
the
country
.
Blueprints
for
doubling
the
CDC
's
present
55000
enrollment
.
Arrangements
for
a
statewide
pre-primary
endorsing
convention
in
Fresno
next
Jan.
26
-
28
.
And
proposals
for
a
whole
series
of
lesser
candidate-picking
conventions
in
the
state
's
38
new
Congressional_districts
.
At
the
head
of
the
CDC
is
an
unorthodox
,
39
-
year-old
amateur
politico
,
Thomas_B._Carvey_Jr.
,
whose
normal
profession
is
helping
develop
Hughes_Aircraft
's
moon
missiles
.
He
's
approached
his
Democratic
duties
in
hard-nosed
engineering
fashion
.
Viewed
from
afar
,
the
CDC
looks_like
a
rather
stalwart
political
pyramid
:
its
elected
directorate
fans_out
into
an
array
of
district
leaders
and
standing_committees
,
and
thence
into
its
component
clubs
and
affiliated
groups
-
500
or_so
.
Much
of
its
strength
stems
from
the
comfortable
knowledge
that
every
``
volunteer
''
Democratic
organization
of
any
consequence
belongs_to
the
CDC
.
Moreover
,
the
entire
state
Democratic
hierarchy
,
from
Gov._Brown
on
down
to
the
county
chairmen
,
also
participates
in_this
huge
operation
.
Contrarily
,
Republican
``
volunteers
''
go
their
separate
ways
,
and
thus_far
have
given
no
indication
that
they
'd
be
willing
to
join_forces
under
a
single
directorate
,
except
in
the_most
loose-knit
fashion
.
Carvey
believes
that
reapportionment
,
which
left
many
Democratic
clubs
split
by
these
new
district
boundaries
,
actually
will
increase
CDC
membership
.
Where
only
one
club
existed
before
,
he
says
,
two
will
flourish
henceforth
.
Biggest
organizational
problem
,
he
adds
,
is
setting_up
CDC
units
in
rock-ribbed
Democratic
territory
.
Paradoxically
the
council
is
weakest
in
areas
that
register
4
-
and
5
-
to-1
in
the
party
's
favor
,
strongest
where
Democrats
and
Republicans
compete
on
a
fairly
even
basis
.
Like
most
Democratic
spokesmen
,
Carvey
predicts
1962
will
be
a
tremendously
``
partisan
year
''
.
Hence
the
attention
they
're
lavishing
on
the
CDC
.
In_all_probability
,
the
council
will
screen
and
endorse
candidates
for
the
Assembly
and
for
Congress
,
and_then
strive
to
put
its
full
weight
behind
these
pre-primary
favorites
.
This
bodes
heated
contests
in
several
districts
where
claims
have
already
been
staked
out
by
Democratic
hopefuls
who
do
n't
see
eye-to-eye
with
the
CDC
.
Naturally
,
the
statewide
races
will
provide
the
major
test
for
the
expanding
council
.
Shunted
aside
by
the
rampant
organizers
for
John_F._Kennedy
last
year
,
who
relegated
it
to
a
somewhat
subordinate
role
in
the
Presidential
campaign
,
the
CDC
plainly
intends
to
provide
the
party
's
campaign
muscle
in
1962
.
There
is
evidence
that
it
will
be
happily
received
by
Gov._Brown
and
the
other
constitutional
incumbents
.
Carvey
considers
that
former
Vice_President
Nixon
would
be
Brown
's
most
formidable
foe
,
with
ex-Gov._Knight
a
close
second
.
But
the
rest
of
the
GOP
gubernatorial
aspirants
do
n't
worry
him
very_much
.
In
his
CDC
work
,
Carvey
has
the
close-in
support
and
advice
of
one
of
California
's
shrewdest
political
strategists
:
former
Democratic
National_Committeeman_Paul_Ziffren
,
who
backed
him
over
a
Northland
candidate
espoused
by
Atty._Gen._Stanley_Mosk
.
(
Significantly
,
bitter
echoes
of
the
1960
power
struggle
that
saw
Mosk
moving_into
the
national
committee
post
over
Ziffren
are
still
audible
in
party
circles
)
.
Note
:
We
've
just
received
an
announcement
of
the
54
th
Assembly
district
post-reapportionment
organizing
convention
Wednesday
night
in
South_Pasadena
's
War_Memorial_Bldg.
,
which
graphically
illustrates
the
CDC
's
broad
appeal
.
State_Sen._Dick_Richards
will
keynote
;
state
and
county
committeemen
,
CDC
directors
and
representatives
,
members
of
16
area
clubs
,
and
``
all
residents
''
have
been
invited
.
This
is
going_to
be
a
language_lesson
,
and
you
can
master
it
in
a_few
minutes
.
It
is
a
short
course
in
Communese
.
It
works
with
English
,
Russian
,
German
,
Hungarian
or
almost
any
other
foreign
tongue
.
Once
you
learn
how
to
translate
Communese
,
much
of
each_day
's
deluge
of
news
will
become
clearer
.
At_least
,
I
have
found
it
so
.
For
some
compulsive
reason
which
would
have
fascinated
Dr._Freud
,
Communists
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
almost
invariably
impute
to
others
the
very
motives
which
they
harbor
themselves
.
They
accuse
their
enemies
of
precisely
the
crimes
of_which
they
themselves
are
most
guilty
.
President_Kennedy
's
latest
warning
to
the
Communist
world
that
the
United_States
will
build_up
its
military
strength
to
meet
any
challenge
in
Berlin
or
elsewhere
was
somewhat
surprisingly
,
reported
in
full
text
or
fairly
accurate
excerpts
behind
the
Iron_Curtain
.
Then
the
Communese
reply
came_back
from
many
mouthpieces
with
striking
consistency
.
Now
listen
closely
.
Moscow
radio
from
the
Literary_Gazette
in
English
to
England
.
``
President
Kennedy
once_again
interpreted
the
Soviet
proposals

peace_treaty
with
Germany
as
a
threat
,
as
part
of
the
world
menace
allegedly
looming
over
the
countries
of
capitalism
.
Evidently
the
war
drum
beating
and
hysteria
so
painstakingly
being
stirred_up
in
the
West
have
been
planned
long
in_advance
.
The
West_Berlin
crisis
is
being
played_up
artificially
because
it
is
needed
by
the
United_States
to
justify
its
arms
drive

.
The
Soviet
news_agency
TASS
datelined
from
New_York
in
English
to
Europe
:
``
President
Kennedy
's
enlargement

that

take
additional
measures
to
increase

tension
:
specifically
to
crush

resume

TASS
from

in

to
Europe
:
``
The
American
press
clamored
for
many
days
promising
President_Kennedy
would
reply
to
the_most
vital
domestic
and
foreign
problems
confronting
the
United_States
.
In_fact
,
the
world
heard
nothing
but
sabre-rattling
,
the
same
exercises
which
proved
futile
for
the
predecessors
of
the
current

If
there
were

race
to
try
to
solve
the
internal
and
external
problems
besetting
the
United_States

its
NATO
partners

Washington
apparently
decided
to
use
an
old
formula
,
by
injecting
large
military
appropriations
to
speed
the
slow
revival
of
the
U._S.
economy
after
a
prolonged
slump

.
And
now
,
for
Communist
listeners
and
readers
:
Moscow_Radio
in
Russian
to
the
USSR
:
``

shown
once_again

As_was_to_be_expected

East_Berlin

radio
in
German
to
Germany
:
``
A
better
position
for
negotiations
is
the
real
point
of_this

Kennedy
knows

not
wage
war
for
West_Berlin
,
neither
conventional
nor
nuclear
,
and
negotiations
will
come
as
certainly
as

Whenever

eliminate

they
have
always

in

In

ones

reflecting
the

Moscow_TASS

``

the
U._S._President
's
disarmament
adviser

John_McCloy
.
Their
conversation
and
dinner
passed
in
a
warm
and
friendly
atmosphere
''
.
Now
,
to
translate
from
the
Communese
,
this
means
:
The
``
West_Berlin
''
crisis
is
really
an
East_Berlin
crisis
.
The
crisis
was
artificially
stirred_up
by
the
Kremlin
(
Wall_Street
)
and
the
Red_Army
(
Pentagon
)
egged_on
by
the
West
Germans
(
East_Germans
)
.
The
reason
was
to
speed_up
domestic
production
in
the
USSR
,
which
Khrushchev
promised
upon
grabbing
power
,
and
try
to
end
the
permanent
recession
in
Russian
living
standards

rattles

he
is
not

fight
neither

Aug.
4
,
1821
,
nearly
a
century
after
Benjamin_Franklin
founded
the
Pennsylvania_Gazette
-
a
century
during
which
it
had
undergone
several
changes
in
ownership
and
a_few
brief
suspensions
in
publication
-
this
paper
made
its
first_appearance
as
the
Saturday_Evening_Post
.
The
country
was
now
full_of
Gazettes
and
Samuel_C._Atkinson
and
Charles_Alexander
,
who
had
just
taken_over
Franklin
's
old
paper
,
desired
a
more
distinctive
name
.
When
founded
by
Franklin
the
Gazette
was
a
weekly
family
newspaper
and
under
its
new
name
its
format
remained
that
of
a
newspaper
but
its
columns
gradually
contained
more_and_more
fiction
,
poetry
,
and
literary
essays
.
In_the_middle
of
the
century
,
with
a
circulation
of
90000
,
the
Post
was
one
of
the_most
popular
weeklies
in
the
country
.
But
during
the
second_half
of
the
century
its
fortunes
reached
a
low
point
and
when
in
1897
Cyrus_H._K._Curtis
purchased
it
-
``
paper
,
type
,
and
all
''
-
for
$
1000
it
was
a
16
-
page
weekly
filled
with
unsigned
fiction
and
initialed
miscellany
,
and
with
only
some
2000
subscribers
.
Little
more_than
a
fine
old
name
,
valuable
principally
because
of
the
Franklin
tradition
,
the
Saturday_Evening_Post
was
slow
to
revive
.
But
Curtis
poured
over
$
1
million
into
it
and
in_time
it
again
became
one
of
the_most
popular
weeklies
of
the
country
.
