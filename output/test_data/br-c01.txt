It
is
not
news
that
Nathan_Milstein
is
a
wizard
of
the
violin
.
Certainly
not
in
Orchestra_hall
where
he
has
played
countless
recitals
,
and
where
Thursday
night
he
celebrated
his
20th
season
with
the
Chicago_Symphony_orchestra
,
playing
the
Brahms_Concerto
with
his
own
slashing
,
demon-ridden
cadenza
melting
into
the
high
,
pale
,
pure
and
lovely
song
with
which
a
violinist
unlocks
the
heart
of
the
music
,
or
forever
finds
it
closed
.
There
was
about
that
song
something
incandescent
,
for
this
Brahms
was
Milstein
at
white_heat
.
Not
the
noblest
performance
we
have
heard
him
play
,
or
the
most
spacious
,
or
even
the
most
eloquent
.
Those
would
be
reserved
for
the
orchestra
's
great
nights
when
the
soloist
can
surpass
himself
.
This
time
the
orchestra
gave
him
some
superb
support
fired
by
response
to
his
own
high
mood
.
But
he
had
in
Walter_Hendl
a
willing
conductor
able
only
up
to
a
point
.
That_is
,
when
Mr._Milstein
thrust
straight
to
the
core
of
the
music
,
sparks
flying
,
bow
shredding
,
violin
singing
,
glittering
and
sometimes
spitting
,
Mr._Hendl
could
go_along
.
But
Mr._Hendl
does
not
go
straight
to
any
point
.
He
flounders
and
lets
music
sprawl
.
There
was
in
the
Brahms
none
of
the
mysterious
and
marvelous
alchemy
by
which
a
great
conductor
can
bring
soloist
,
orchestra
and
music
to
ultimate
fusion
.
So
we
had
some
dazzling
and
memorable
Milstein
,
but
not
great
Brahms
.
The
concert
opened
with
another
big
romantic
score
,
Schumann's
Overture_to_Manfred
,
which
suffered
fate
,
this
time
with
orchestral
thrusts
to
the
Byronic
point
to
keep
it
afloat
.
Hindemith
's
joust
with
Weber
tunes
was
a
considerably
more
serious
misfortune
,
for
it
demands
translucent
textures
,
buoyant
rhythms
,
and
astringent
wit
.
It
got
the
kind
of
scrambled
,
coarsened
performance
that
can
happen
to
best
of
orchestras
when
the
man
with
the
baton
lacks
technique
and
style
.
The
Bayreuth_Festival

Remember
how
BY
a
series
of
booking
absurdities
Chicago
missed
seeing
the
Bolshoi_Ballet
?
Remember
how
by
lack
of
two
big
theaters
Chicago
missed
the
first
visit
of
the
Royal_Danish_Ballet
?
Well
,
now
we
have
two
big
theaters
.
But
barring
a
miracle
,
and
do
n't
hold
your
breath
for
it
,
Chicago
will
not
see
the
Leningrad-Kirov_Ballet
,
which
stems
from
the
ballet
cradle
of
the
Maryinsky
and
is
one
of
the
great
companies
of
the
world
.
Before
you
let_loose
a
howl
saying
we
announced
its
coming
,
not
once
but
several
times
,
indeed
we
did
.
The
engagement
was_supposed_to
be
all
set
for
the
big
theater
in
McCormick_Place
,
which
Sol_Hurok
,
ballet
booker
extraordinary
,
considers
the
finest
house
of
its
kind
in
the
country
-
and
of_course
he
does
n't
weep
at
the
capacity
,
either
.
It
was
all
set
.
Allied_Arts
corporation
first
listed
the
Chicago
dates
as
Dec.
4
thru
10
.
Later
the
Hurok
office
made
it
Dec.
8
thru
17
,
a
nice
,
long
booking
for
the
full
repertory
.
But
if
you
keep
a
calendar
of
events
,
as
we
do
,
you
noticed
a
conflict
.
Allied_Arts
had
booked
Marlene_Dietrich
into
McCormick_Place
Dec.
8
and
9
.
Something
had
to
give
.
Not
La_Dietrich
.
Allied_Arts
then
notified
us
that
the
Kirov
would
cut_short
its
Los_Angeles
booking
,
fly
here
to
open
Nov.
28
,
and
close
Dec.
2
.
Shorter
booking
,
but
still
a
booking
.
We
printed
it
.
A_couple_of
days
later
a
balletomane
told
me
he
had
telephoned
Allied_Arts
for
ticket
information
and
was
told
``
the
newspapers
had
made
a
mistake
''
.
So
I
started
making
some
calls
of
my
own
.
These
are
the
results
.
The
Kirov_Ballet
is
firmly
booked
into
the
Shrine_Auditorium
,
Los_Angeles
,
Nov.
21
thru
Dec.
4
.
Not
a
chance
of
opening
here
Nov.
28
-
barring
that
miracle
.
Then
why
not
the
juicy
booking
Hurok
had
held
for
us
?
Well
,
Dietrich
won't
budge
from
McCormick_Place
.
Then
how
about
the
Civic_Opera_house
?
Well
,
Allied_Arts
has
booked
Lena_Horne
there
for
a
week
starting
Dec.
4
.
Queried
about
the
impasse
,
Allied_Arts
said
:
``
Better
cancel
the
Kirov
for_the_time_being
.
It
's
all
up_in_the_air
again
''
.
So
the
Kirov
will
fly
back
to
Russia
,
minus
a
Chicago
engagement
,
a
serious
loss
for
dance
fans
-
and
for
the
frustrated
bookers
,
cancellation
of
one
of
the
richest
bookings
in
the
country
.
Will
somebody
please
reopen
the
Auditorium
?

In
the
line
of
operatic
trades
to
cushion
the
budget
,
the
Dallas_Civic_Opera
will
use
San_Francisco
's
new
Leni_Bauer-Ecsy
production
of
``
Lucia_di_Lammermoor
''
this
season
,
returning
the
favor
next
season
when
San_Francisco
uses
the
Dallas
``
Don_Giovanni
''
,
designed
by
Franco_Zeffirelli
.
H._E._Bates
has
scribbled
a
farce
called
``
Hark_,_Hark_,_the_Lark
''
!
It
is
one
of
the
most
entertaining
and
irresponsible
novels
of
the
season
.
If
there
is
a
moral
lurking
among
the
shenanigans
,
it
is
hard
to
find
.
Perhaps
the
lesson
we
should
take
from
these
pages
is
that
the
welfare_state
in
England
still
allows
wild
scope
for
all
kinds
of
rugged
eccentrics
.
Anyway
,
a
number
of
them
meet
here
in
devastating
collisions
.
One
is
an
imperial
London
stockbroker
called
Jerebohm
.
Another
is
a
wily
countryman
called
Larkin
,
whose
blandly
boisterous
progress
has
been
chronicled
,
I
believe
,
in
earlier
volumes
of
Mr._Bates
'
comedie_humaine
.
What
's
up
now
?
Well
,
Jerebohm
and
his
wife
Pinkie
have
reached
the
stage
of
affluence
that
stirs
a
longing
for
the
more
atrociously
expensive
rustic
simplicities
.
They
want
to
own
a
junior-grade
castle
,
or
a
manor_house
,
or
some
modest
little
place
where
Shakespeare
might
once
have
staged
a
pageant
for
Great_Elizabeth
and
all
her
bearded
courtiers
.
They
are
willing
to
settle
,
however
,
in
anything
that
offers
pheasants
to
shoot
at
and
peasants
to
work_at
.
And
of_course
Larkin
has
just
the
thing
they
want
.
It
's
a
horror
.
The
name
of_it
is
Gore_Court
,
and
it
is
surrounded
by
a
wasteland
that
would
impress
T._S._Eliot
.
That
's
not
precisely
the
way
Larkin
urges
them
to
look_at
it
,
though
.
He
conjures
herds
of
deer
,
and
wild
birds
crowding
the
air
.
He
suggests
that
Gore_Court
embodies
all
the
glories
of
Tudor
splendor
.
The
stained-glass_windows
may
have
developed
unpremeditated
patinas
,
the
paneling
may
be
no
more
durable
than
the
planks
in
a
political_platform
.
The
vast
,
dungeon
kitchens
may
seem
hardly
worth
using
except
on
occasions
when
one
is
faced
with
a_thousand
unexpected
guests
for
lunch
.
Larkin
has
an
answer
to
all
that
.
The
spaciousness
of
the
Tudor
cooking
areas
,
for_example
,
will
provide
needed
space
for
the
extra
television_sets
required
by
modern
butlers
,
cooks
and
maids
.
Also
,
perhaps
,
table-tennis
and
other
indoor
sports
to
keep
them
fit
and
contented
.
It
's
a
wonder
,
really
,
to
how
much
mendacious
trouble
Larkin
puts
himself
to
sell
the
Jerebohms
that
preposterous
manse
.
He
does
n't
really
need
the
immense
sum_of_money
(
probably
converted
from
American
gold
on
the
London_Exchange
)
he
makes
them
pay
.
For
Larkin
is
already
wonderfully
contented
with
his
lot
.
He
has
a
glorious
wife
and
many
children
.
When
he
needs
money
to
buy
something
like
,
say
,
the
Rolls-Royce
he
keeps
near
his
vegetable_patch
,
he
takes_a_flyer
in
the
sale
of
surplus
army
supplies
.
One
of
those
capital-gains
ventures
,
in_fact
,
has
saddled
him
with
Gore_Court
.
He
is
willing
to
sell
it
just
to
get_it_off_his_hands
.
And
the
Jerebohms
are
more_than
willing
to
buy
it
.
They
plan
to
become
county
people
who
know
the
proper
way
to
terminate
a
fox
's
life
on
earth
.
If
,
in
Larkin
's
eyes
,
they
are
nothing
but
Piccadilly
farmers
,
he
has
as
much
to
learn
about
them
as
they
have
to
learn
about
the
ways
of
truly
rural
living
.
Mr._Bates
shows
us
how
this
mutual
education
spreads
its
inevitable
havoc
.
Oneupmanship
is
practiced
by
both
sides
in
a
total
war
.
First
the
Larkins
are
ahead
,
then
the
Jerebohms
.
After
Larkin
has
been
persuaded
to
restock
his
tangled
acres
with
pheasants
,
he
poaches
only
what
he
needs
for
the
nourishment
of
his
family
and
local
callers
.
One
of
the
local
callers
,
a
retired
brigadier
apparently
left_over
from
Kipling
's
tales
of
India
,
does
not
approve
of
the
way
Larkin
gets
his
birds
.
He
does
n't
think
that
potting
them
from
a
deck_chair
on
the
south_side
of
the
house
with
a
quart
glass
of
beer
for
sustenance
is
entirely
sporting
.
But
the
brigadier
dines
on
the
birds
with
relish
.
It
is
truly
odd
and
ironic
that
the
most
handsome
and
impressive
film
yet
made
from
Miguel_de_Cervantes
'
``
Don_Quixote
''
is
the
brilliant
Russian
spectacle
,
done
in
wide_screen
and
color
,
which
opened
yesterday
at
the
Fifty-fifth_Street
and
Sixty-eighth_Street_Playhouses
.
More_than
a
beautiful
visualization
of
the
illustrious
adventures
and
escapades
of
the
tragi-comic
knight-errant
and
his
squire
,
Sancho_Panza
,
in
seventeenth
century
Spain
,
this
inevitably
abbreviated
rendering
of
the
classic
satire
on
chivalry
is
an
affectingly
warm
and
human
exposition
of
character
.
Nikolai_Cherkasov
,
the
Russian
actor
who
has
played
such
heroic
roles
as
Alexander_Nevsky
and
Ivan_the_Terrible
,
performs
the
lanky
Don_Quixote
,
and
does
so
with
a
simple
dignity
that
bridges
the
inner
nobility
and
the
surface
absurdity
of
this
poignant
man
.
His
addle-brained
knight-errant
,
self
appointed
to
the
ridiculous
position
in
an
age
when
armor
had
already
been
relegated
to
museums
and
the
chivalrous
code
of
knight-errantry
had
become
a
joke
,
is
,
as
Cervantes
no_doubt
intended
,
a
gaunt
but
gracious
symbol
of
good
,
moving
soberly
and
sincerely
in
a
world
of
cynics
,
hypocrites
and
rogues
.
Cherkasov
does
not
caricature
him
,
as
some
actors
have
been
inclined
to
do
.
He
treats
this
deep-eyed
,
bearded
,
bony
crackpot
with
tangible
affection
and
respect
.
Directed
by
Grigory_Kozintsev
in
a
tempo
that
is
studiously
slow
,
he
develops
a
sense
of
a
high
tradition
shining
brightly
and
passing
gravely
through
an
impious
world
.
The
complexities
of
communication
have
been
considerably
abetted
in
this
case
by
appropriately
stilted
English_language
that
has
been
excellently
dubbed
in_place_of
the
Russian
dialogue
.
The
voices
of
all
the
characters
,
including
that
of
Cherkasov
,
have
richness
,
roughness
or
color
to
conform
with
the
personalities
.
And
the
subtleties
of
the
dialogue
are
most
helpfully
conveyed
.
Since
Russian
was
being
spoken
instead
of
Spanish
,
there
is
no
violation
of
artistry
or
logic
here
.
Splendid
,
too
,
is
the
performance
of
Yuri_Tolubeyev
,
one
of
Russia
's
leading
comedians
,
as
Sancho_Panza
,
the
fat
,
grotesque
``
squire
''
.
Though
his
character
is
broader
and
more
comically
rounded
than
the
don
,
he
gives
it
a
firmness
and
toughness
-
a
sort_of
peasant
dignity
-
too
.
It
is
really
as
though
the
Russians
have
seen
in
this
character
the
oftentimes
underlying
vitality
and
courage
of
supposed
buffoons
.
The
episode
in
which
Sancho_Panza
concludes
the
joke
that
is
played
on
him
when
he
is
facetiously
put
in
command
of
an
``
island
''
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
film
.
True
,
the
pattern
and
flow
of
the
drama
have
strong
literary
qualities
that
are
a_bit
wearisome
in
the
first_half
,
before
Don_Quixote
goes
to
the
duke
's
court
.
But
strength
and
poignancy
develop
thenceforth
,
and
the
windmill
and
deathbed
episodes
gather
the
threads
of
realization
of
the
wonderfulness
of
the
old_boy
.
There
are
other
good
representations
of
peasants
and
people
of
the
court
by
actors
who
are
finely
costumed
and
magnificently
photographed
in
this
last
of
the
Russian
films
to
reach
this
country
in
the
program
of
joint
cultural
exchange
.
Also
on
the
bill
at
the
Fifty-fifth_Street
is
a
nice
ten
minute
color
film
called
``
Sunday_in_Greenwich_Village
''
,
a
tour
of
the
haunts
and
joints
.
