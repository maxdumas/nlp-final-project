``
A
Night
in
New_Orleans
''
is
the
gayety
planned
by
members
of
the
Thrift_Shop_Committee
for
May
6
at
Philmont
Country_Club
.
The
women
have
a
reputation
for
giving
parties
that
are
different
and
are
fun
and
this
year
's
promises
to
follow
in_this
fine
tradition
.
Mrs._H._J._Grinsfelder
is
chairman
.
The
Louisiana
city
is
known
,
of_course
,
for
its
fine
food
,
good
music
and
its
colorful
hospitality
``
and
,
when
guests
arrive_at
Philmont
that
night
''
,
says
Mrs._Grinsfelder
,
``
that
is
exactly
what
we
expect
to
offer
them
.
We
've
been
working
for
weeks
.
The
prospects
look
great
.
We
are
keeping
a_number_of
surprises
under
our
hats
.
But
we
can
n't
tell
it
all
now_and_then
have
no
new
excitement
later
''
.
But
she
does
indicate
festivities
will
start
early
,
that
a
jazz
combo
will
``
give
with
the
Basin_Street
beat
''
during
the
cocktail
and
dinner
hours
and
that
Lester_Lanin
's
orchestra
will
take_over
during
the
dancing
.
As
for
food
,
Mrs._Henry_Louchheim
,
chairman
of_this
phase
,
is
a
globetrotter
who
knows
good
food
.
``
New_Orleans
''
?
she
says
,
``
of_course
I
've
had
the
best
.
It
is
just
bad_luck
that
we
are
having
the
party
in
a
month
with
no
R
's
,
so
no
oysters
.
But
we
have
lots_of
other
New_Orleans
specialties
.
I
know
they
will
be
good
.
We
've
tried
them
out
on
the
club
chef
-
or
say
,
he
has
tried
them
out
on
us
and
we
have
selected
the
best
''
.
Guests
will
be
treated
to
Gulf_Coast
scenic
effects
.
There
will
be
masses
of
flowers
,
reproductions
of
the
handsome
old
buildings
with
their
grillwork
and
other
things
that
are
typical
of
New_Orleans
.
Mrs._Harry_K._Cohen
is
chairman
of_this
phase
and
she
is
getting
an
artistic
assist
from
A._Van_Hollander
,
display
director
of
Gimbel
Brothers
.
The
gala
is
the
Thrift_Shop
's
annual
bundle
party
and
,
as
all
Thrift_Shop
friends
know
,
that
means
the
admission
is
a
bundle
of
used
clothing
in
good_condition
,
contributions
of
household
equipment
,
bric-a-brac
and
such
to
stock
the
shelves
at
the
shop
's
headquarters
at
1213
Walnut_St.
.
For
the
convenience
of
guests
bundle
centers
have
been
established
throughout
the
city
and
suburbs
where
the
donations
may
be
deposited
between
now

the
big

the
bundles
,

Some
idea
of
the
competence
of
the
women
is
indicated
in
the
contribution
made
by
them
during
the
past
25
years
that
totals
$
