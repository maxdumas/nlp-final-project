During
the
Dorr
trial
the
Democratic
press
condemned
the
proceedings
and
heralded
Dorr
as
a
martyr
to
the
principles
of
the
Declaration_of_Independence
.
During
the
Brown
trial
,
however
,
the
state
's
most
powerful
Democratic
newspaper
,
the
Providence_Daily_Post
,
stated
that
Brown
was
a
murderer
,
a
man
of
blood
,
and
that
he
and
his
associates
,
with
the
assistance
of
Republicans
and
Abolitionists
,
had
plotted
not_only
the
liberation
of
the
slaves
but
also
the
overthrow
of
state
and
federal_governments
.
The
Providence_Daily_Journal
answered
the
Daily_Post
by
stating
that
the
raid
of
John_Brown
was
characteristic
of
Democratic
acts
of
violence
and
that
``
He
was
acting
in
direct
opposition
to
the
Republican_Party
,
who
proclaim
as
one
of
their
cardinal
principles
that
they
do
not
interfere
with
slavery
in
the
states
''
.
The
two
major
newspapers
in
Providence
continued
,
throughout
the
crisis
,
to
accuse
each
other
of
misrepresenting
the
facts
and
attempting
to
falsify
history
.
While
the
Daily_Post
continued
to
accuse
Republicans
and
the
Daily_Journal
continued
to
accuse
Democrats
,
the
Woonsocket_Patriot
complained
that
the
Virginia
authorities
showed
indecent
and
cowardly
haste
to
condemn
Brown
and
his
men
.
Editor_Foss
stated
,
``
Of
their
guilt
there
can
be
no_doubt
but
they
are
entitled
to
sufficient
time
to
prepare
for
trial
,
and
a
fair
trial
''
.
The
Providence_Daily_Post
thought
that
there
were
probably
good
reasons
for
the
haste
in
which
the
trial
was
being
conducted
and
that
the
only
thing
gained
by
a
delay
would
be
calmer
feelings
.
The
Providence_Daily_Journal
stated
that
although
the
guilt
of
Brown
was
evident
,
the
South
must
guarantee
him
a
fair
trial
to
preserve
domestic
peace
.
On
October
31
,
1859
,
John_Brown
was
found
guilty
of
treason
against
the
state
of
Virginia
,
inciting
slave
rebellion
,
and
murder
.
For
these
crimes
he
was
sentenced
to
be
hanged
in_public
on
Friday
,
December
2
,
1859
.
Upon
receiving
the
news
,
Northern
writers
,
editors
,
and
clergymen
heaped
accusations
of
murder
on
the
Southern
states
,
particularly
Virginia
.
Although
Rhode_Islanders
were
preparing
for
the
state
elections
,
they
watched
John_Brown
's
trial
with
extreme
interest
.
On
Wednesday
morning
,
November_2
,
1859
,
the
Providence_Daily_Journal
stated
that
although
Brown
justly
deserved
the
extreme
penalty
,
no
man
,
however
criminal
,
ought
to
suffer
the
penalty
without
a
fairer
trial
.
The
editor
's
main
criticism
of
the
trial
was
the
haste
with
which
it
was
conducted
.
The
readers
of
the
Providence_Daily_Post
,
however
,
learned
that
it
was
generally
conceded
that
``
Old_Brown
''
had
a
fair
trial
.
Concerning
the
sentence
the
editor
asked
,
``
What
else
can
Virginia
do
than
to
hang
the
men
who
have
defied
her
laws
,
organized
treason
,
and
butchered
her
citizens
''
.
In
the
eastern
section
of
the
state
the
newspapers
'
reaction
to
Brown
's
trial
and
sentence
were
basically
identical
.
J._Wheaton_Smith
,
editor
of
the
Warren_Telegraph
stated
that
``
the
ends
of
justice
must
be
satisfied
,
a
solitary
example
must
be
set
,
in_order_that
all
those
misnamed
philantropists
[
sic
]
,
who
,
actuated
by
a
blind
zeal
,
dare
to
instigate
riot
,
treason
,
and
murder
,
may
heed
it
and
shape
their
future
course
accordingly
''
.
The
editor
of
the
Newport_Advertiser
could
discover
no
evidence
of
extenuating
circumstances
in
the
Brown
trial
which
would
warrant
making
an
exception
to
the
infliction
of
capital_punishment
.
In
direct_contrast
to
the
other
Rhode_Island
editors
,
Samuel_S._Foss
of
the
Woonsocket_Patriot
outwardly
condemned
the
trial
as
being
completely
unfair
.
Concerning
the
sentence
,
Foss
wrote
,
``
If
it
be
possible
that
mercy
shall
override
vengeance
and
that
John_Brown
's
sentence
shall
be
commuted
to
imprisonment
,
it
would
be
well
-
well
for
the
country
and
for
Virginia
''
.
Despite
the
excitement
being
caused
by
the
trial
and
sentence
of
John_Brown
,
Rhode_Islanders
turned
their
attention
to
the
state
elections
.
The
state
had
elected
Republican
candidates
in
the
past
two
years
.
There
was
no_doubt
as_to
the
control
the
Republican_party
exercised
throughout
the
state
.
If
it
failed
on_occasion
to
elect
its
candidates
for
general
state
offices
by
majorities
,
the
failure
was
due_to
a
lingering
remnant
of
the
Know-Nothing
party
,
which
called
itself
the
American
Republican_party
.
The
American_Republicans
and
the
Republicans
both
nominated
lieutenant-governor
Turner
for
governor
.
Elisha_R._Potter
was
the
Democratic
candidate
.
The
results
of
the
election
of
1859
found
Republican
candidates
not_only
winning
the
offices
of
governor
and
lieutenant-governor
but
also
obtaining
the
two
Congressional
offices
from
the
eastern
and
western
sections
of
the
state
.
During
the
month
of
November
hardly_a
day
passed
when
there
was
not
some
mention
of
John_Brown
in
the
Rhode_Island
newspapers
.
On
November
7
,
1859
,
the
Providence_Daily_Journal
reprinted
a
letter
sent
to
John_Brown
from
``
E._B.
''
,
a
Quaker
lady
in
Newport
.
In
reference_to
Brown
's
raid
she
wrote
,
``
though
we
are
non-resistants
and
religiously
believe
it
better
to
reform
by
moral
and
not
by
carnal
weapons
we
know
thee
was
anemated
[
sic
]
by
the
most
generous
and
philanthropic
motives
''
.
``
E._B.
''
compared
John_Brown
to
Moses
in_that
they
were
both
acting
to
deliver
millions
from
oppression
.
In
contrast
to
``
E._B.
''
,
most
Rhode_Islanders
hardly
thought_of
John_Brown
as
being
another
Moses
.
Most
attempts
to
develop
any
sympathy
for
Brown
and
his
actions
found
an
unresponsive
audience
in
Rhode_Island
.
On
Wednesday
evening
,
November
23
,
1859
,
in
Warren
,
Rev._Mark_Trafton
of
New_Bedford
,
gave
a
``
Mission_of_Sympathy
''
lecture
in
which
he
favorably
viewed
the
Harper_'s_Ferry
insurrection
.
The
Warren_Telegraph
stated
that
many
of
Rev._Trafton
's
remarks
were
inappropriate
and
savored
strongly
of
radicalism
and
fanaticism
.
In
its
account
of
the
Trafton
lecture
,
the
Providence_Daily_Post
said
that
the
remarks
of
Rev._Trafton
made
the
people
indignant
.
No
sympathy
or
admiration
for
Brown
could
be
found
in
the
Providence_Daily_Post
,
for
the
editor
claimed
that
there
were
a
score
of
men
in
the
state_prison
who
were
a_thousand
times
more
deserving
of
sympathy
.
The
Providence_Daily_Journal
,
however
,
stated
that
Brown
's
courage
,
bravery
,
and
heroism
``
in
a
good
cause
would
make
a
man
a
martyr
;
it
gives
something
of
dignity
even
to
a
bad
one
''
.
The
Woonsocket_Patriot
admitted
that
John_Brown
might
deserve
punishment
or
imprisonment
``
but
he
should
no_more
be
hung
than
Henry_A._Wise
or
James_Buchanan
''
.
The
Newport_Mercury
exhibited
more
concern
over
the
possibility
of
the
abolitionists
making
a
martyr
of
Brown
than
it
did
over
the
development
of
sympathy
for
him
.
In
her
letter
to
John_Brown
,
``
E._B.
''
,
the
Quakeress
from
Newport
,
had
suggested
that
the
American
people
owed
more
honor
to
John_Brown
for
seeking
to
free
the
slaves
than
they
did
to
George_Washington
.
During
the
latter
days
of
November
to
the
day
of
Brown
's
execution
,
it
seems
that
most
Rhode_Islanders
did
not
concur
in
``
E._B.
's
''
suggestion
.
On
November
22
,
1859
,
the
Providence_Daily_Journal
stated
that
although
Brown
's
``
pluck
''
and
honest
fanaticism
must
be
admired
,
any
honor
paid
to
Brown
would
only
induce
other
fanatics
to
imitate
his
actions
.
A
week
later
the
Daily_Journal
had
discovered
the
initial
plans
of
some
Providence
citizens
to
hold
a
meeting
honoring
John_Brown
on
the
day
of
his
execution
.
The
editor
of
the
Daily_Journal
warned
,
``
that
if
such
a
demonstration
be
made
,
it
will
not
find
support
or
countenance
from
any
of
the
men
whose
names
are
recognized
as
having
a
right
to
speak_for
Providence
''
.
The
Providence_Daily_Post
's
editor
wrote
that
he
could
not
believe
that
a
meeting
honoring
Brown
was
to
be
held
in
Providence
.
He
further
called_upon
the
people
of
Providence
to
rebuke
the
meeting
and
avoid
disgrace
.
On
December
2
,
1859
,
John_Brown
was
hanged
at
Charles_Town
,
Virginia
.
Extraordinary
precautions
were
taken
so
that
no
stranger
be
allowed_in
the
city
and
no
citizen
within
the
enclosure
surrounding
the
scaffold
.
In
many
Northern
towns
and
cities
meetings
were
held
and
church_bells
were
tolled
.
Such
was
not
the
case
in
Rhode_Island
.
The
only
public
demonstration
in
honor
of
John_Brown
was
held
at
Pratt_'s_Hall
in
Providence
,
on
the
day
of
his
execution
.
Despite
the
opposition
of
the
city
newspapers
,
the
Pratt_Hall
meeting
``
brought_together
a
very
respectable
audience
,
composed
in
part
of
those
who
had
been
distinguished
for
years
for
their
radical
views
upon
the
subject
of
slavery
,
of
many_of
our
colored
citizens
,
and
of
those
who
were
attracted
to
the
place
by
the
novelty
of
such
a
gathering
''
.
Seated
on
the
platform
were
Amos_C._Barstow
,
ex-mayor
of
Providence
and
a
wealthy
Republican
stove
manufacturer
;
Thomas_Davis
,
an
uncompromising
Garrisonian
;
the
Reverend_Augustus_Woodbury
,
a
Unitarian
minister
;
the
Reverend_George_T._Day
,
a
Free-Will
Baptist
;
Daniel_w._Vaughan
,
and
William_H._H._Clements
.
The
latter
two
were
appointed
secretaries
.
The
first
speaker
was
Amos_C._Barstow
who
had
been
unanimously
chosen
president
of
the
meeting
.
He
spoke
of
his
desire
to
promote
the
abolition
of
slavery
by
peaceable
means
and
he
compared
John_Brown
of
Harper_'s_Ferry
to
the
John_Brown
of
Rhode_Island
's
colonial
period
.
Barstow
concluded
that
as
Rhode_Island
's
John_Brown
became
a
canonized
hero
,
if
not
a
saint
,
so
would
it
be
with
John_Brown
of
Harper_'s_Ferry
.
The
next
speaker
was
George_T._Day
.
Although
admitting
Brown
's
guilt
on
legal
grounds
,
Day
said
that
,
``
Brown
is
no
common
criminal
;
his
deed
was
not
below
,
but
above
the
law
''
.
Following
Day
was
Woodbury
who
spoke
of
his
disapproval
of
Brown
's
attempt
at
servile
insurrection
,
his
admiration
of
Brown
's
character
,
and
his
opposition
to
slavery
.
Woodbury
's
remarks
were
applauded
by
a
portion
of
the
audience
several
times
and
once
there
was
hissing
.
The
fourth
and
last
speaker
was
Thomas_Davis
.
By
this
time
large_numbers
of
the
audience
had
left
the
hall
.
Davis
commenced
his
remarks
by
an
allusion
to
the
general
feeling
of
opposition
which
the
meeting
had
encountered
from
many
of
the
citizens
and
all
the
newspapers
of
the
city
.
He
said
that
the
propriety
or
impropriety
of
such
a
gathering
was
a
question
that
was
to
be
settled
by
every
man
in
accordance
with
the
convictions
of
private
judgments
.
In
the
remainder
of
his
speech
Davis
spoke
of
his
admiration
for
Brown
and
warned
those
who
took_part
in
the
meeting
that
they
``
are
liable
to
the
charge
that
they
are
supporting
traitors
and
upholding
men
whom
the
laws
have
condemned
''
.
He
recalled
that
in
Rhode_Island
a
party
opposed
to
the
state
's
condemnation
of
a
man
(
Thomas_W._Dorr
)
proclaimed
the
state
's
action
as
a
violation
of
the
law
of
the
land
and
the
principles
of
human
liberty
.
At
the
close
of
Davis
'
speech
the
following
preamble
and
resolutions
were
read
by
the
president
,
and
on
the
question
of
their
adoption
passed
unanimously
:
Whereas
,
John_Brown
has
cheerfully
risked
his
life
in
endeavoring
to
deliver
those
who
are
denied
all
rights
and
is
this
day
doomed
to
suffer
death
for
his
efforts
in
behalf
of
those
who
have
no
helper
:
Therefore
,
Resolved
that
,
while
we
most
decidedly
disapprove
the
methods
he
adopted
to
accomplish
his
objects
,
yet
in
his
willingness
to
die
in
aid
of
the
great
cause
of
human
freedom
,
we
still
recognize
the
qualities
of
a
noble
nature
and
the
exercise
of
a
spirit
which
true
men
have
always
admired
and
which
history
never
fails
to
honor
.
Resolved
that
his
wrongs
and
bereavements
in
Kansas
,
occasioned
by
the
violence
and
brutality
of
those
who
were
intent_on
the
propagation
of
slavery
in
that
territory
,
call_for
a
charitable
judgment
upon
his
recent
efforts
in
Virginia
to
undermine
the
despotism
from
which
he
had
suffered
,
and
commend
his
family
to
the
special
sympathy
and
aid
of
all
who
pity
suffering
and
reverence
justice
.
Resolved
that
the
anti
slavery
sentiment
is
becoming
ripe
for
resolute
action
.
Resolved
,
that
we
find
in
this
fearful
tragedy
at
Harper_'s_Ferry
a
reason
for
more
earnest
effort
to
remove
the
evil
of
slavery
from
the
whole
land
as
speedily
as
possible
.
On
the
morning
following
the
Pratt_Hall
meeting
the
editor
of
the
Providence_Daily_Journal
wrote
that
although
the
meeting
was
milder
and
less
extreme
than
those
held
in
other
areas
for
similar
purposes
,
it
could
have
been
avoided
completely
.
