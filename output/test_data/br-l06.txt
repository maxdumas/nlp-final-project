Eight
,
nine
steps
above
him
,
Roberts
had
paused
.
Mickey
paused
with
him
,
waiting
,
no_longer
impatient
,
trying
now
to
think
it
out
,
do
a_little
planning
.
He
looked
down
over
the
banister
at
the
hotel
desk
,
with
the
telephone
and
pen
set
.
If
I
could
call_in
,
they
could
check
the
story
while
we
were
on
our
way
.
I
would
n't
have_to
tell
them
I
had
Roberts
-
Then
he
heard
it
,
like
a
muffled
thud
,
felt
a
subtle
change
in
air_pressure
.
He
glanced
up
in_time
to
see
Roberts
hurtling
down
on
him
from
above
,
literally
flying
through
the
air
,
his
bloody
face
twisted
.
Mickey
tried
to
flatten
against
the
banister
,
gripped
it
with
one
hand
,
but
Roberts
'
full
weight
struck
him
at
that
moment
in
the
groin
.
He
gasped
for
air
and
the
impact
tore
his
hand
from
the
rail
.
He
tumbled
with
Roberts
,
helpless
and
in
agony
,
over_and_over
,
down
the
steps
.
By
a
wrenching
effort
,
he
managed
to
hunch
and
draw_in
,
to
take
the
final
fall
on
his
back
and
shoulders
rather_than
his
head
.
He
was
fuzzy
in
his
mind
and
,
for
a
moment
,
helpless
on
the
lobby
floor
,
but
he
was
conscious
,
and
free_of
the
weight
of
Roberts
'
body
.
When
his
vision
cleared
he
saw
the
taller
one
scrambling
upward
,
reaching
.
Mickey
was
on
his
knees
when
Roberts
turned
on
the
stairs
and
the
razor
flashed
in
his
hand
.
He
felt
his
empty
pocket
and
knew
that
Roberts
had
retrieved
the
only
weapon
at_hand
.
Mickey
's
eyes
fixed
on
the
other
's
feet
,
which
would
first
betray
the
moment
and
direction
of
an
attack
.
He
rose
stiffly
,
forcing
his
knees
to
lock
.
The
knifelike
pain
in
his
groin
nearly
brought
him
down
again
.
He
made
himself
back_off
slowly
,
his
eyes
wary
on
Roberts
,
who
now
had
no_more
to
lose
than
he
.
The
pain
dulled
as
he
moved
,
and
he
steadied
inside
.
After
a
moment
he
extended
one
hand
,
the
fingers
curled
.
``
Come_on
''
,
he
said
.
``
You
want
to
be
that
big
a
fool
-
I
was
hoping
for
this
''
.
Roberts
brushed
at
his
eyes
with
his
free
hand
and
started
down
the
steps
.
He
held
the
razor
well
out
to
one
side
.
He
was
invulnerable
to
attack
,
but
he
could
be
handled
,
Mickey
knew
,
if
he
could
be
brought
to
make
the
first
move
.
They
were
eight
feet
apart
when
Roberts
cleared
the
last
step
.
Mickey
waited
with
slack
arms
.
``
Any
time
,
Roberts
''
,
he
said
.
``
Or
would
it
be
easier
if
I
put
my
hands
in
my
pockets
''
?
The
taunt
was
lost
on
Roberts
.
He
advanced
slowly
,
directly
,
giving
no
hint
of
a
feint
to
either
side
.
He
was
just
short
of
arm
's
reach
when
he
stopped
.
Mickey
backed_off
two
steps
,
forcing
him
to
come_on
again
.
There
was
a
fixed
grin
on
Roberts
'
face
,
made
hideous
by
the
swollen
nose
and
the
smeared
blood
.
Mickey
backed_off
again
and
Roberts
hesitated
,
then
came
along
.
They
moved
in
a
series
of
rhythmic
fits
and
starts
,
a
macabre
dance
-
two
steps
back
,
two
steps
forward
,
two
steps
back
.
Mickey
felt
his
shoulders
come_up
against
the
wall
beside
the
heavy
slab
front_door
.
This
was
going_to
be
it
now
,
any
second
,
and
what
he
had
to
remember
was
to
keep
his
eye
on
the
razor
,
no_matter
what
,
even
if
Roberts
should
feint
with
a
kick
to
the
groin
,
the
deadly
hand
was
his
exclusive
concern
.
The
kick
came
,
sudden
and
vicious
but
short
.
Mickey
's
guts
twisted
with
the
effort
,
but
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
weapon
.
It
moved
in
a
silver
arc
toward
his
throat
,
then
veered
downward
.
He
hunched
his
left
shoulder
into
it
and
slashed
at
Roberts
'
forearm
with
his
own
,
felt
the
blade
slide
off
his
sleeve
.
Before
Roberts
could
move
inside
to
cut
upward
toward
his
face
,
he
slammed
his
right
fist
into
Roberts
'
belly
.
Roberts
sagged
and
slashed
at
him
wildly
.
Ducking
,
Mickey
tripped
and
fell
to
one
side
,
landing
heavily
on
the
wood
floor
.
Then
Roberts
was
on
him
,
gasping
for
breath
and
for
a_couple_of
seconds
Mickey
lost
sight
of
the
blade
.
He
felt
it
rip
at
the
side
of
his
jacket
and
a
momentary
sting
under
his
left
ribs
.
He
got
a
knee
up
into
Roberts
'
belly
,
used
both
hands
and
heaved
him
clear
,
then
scrambled
to
his
feet
.
They
were
in_the_center
of
the
lobby
now
.
Still
clutching
the
razor
,
Roberts
came_up
into
a
crouch
,
shaking
his
head
.
When
he
charged
Mickey
was
ready
.
He
hit
Roberts
with
his
left
fist
in
the
ribs
and
the
razor
cut
toward
him
feebly
,
then
wobbled
in
mid-air
.
With
his
right
fist
,
and
nearly
all
his
weight
behind
it
,
he
smashed
at
the
bloodstained
face
.
Roberts
careened
backward
,
his
back
arched
,
fought
for
balance
and
,
failing
,
stumbled
against
the
newel_post
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
.
The
sound
of
his
head
striking
the
solid
wood
was
an
ultimate
,
sudden-end
sound
.
He
fell
on
his
side
across
the
lowest
step
,
rolled_over
once
,
then
lay
still
.
Mickey
found
himself
leaning_against
the
desk
,
with
stiff
hands
,
panting
for
breath
.
After
a
minute
he
went
to
Roberts
,
looked
at
one
of
his
eyes
and
felt
for
a
pulse
.
He
could
n't
feel
any
.
Roberts
appeared
to
be
dead
;
if_not
yet
,
then
soon
,
very
soon
.
Suddenly
it
was
cold
in
the
lobby
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
a
long_time
had
passed
before
he
decided
what
to
do
.
Actually
it
was
no_more_than
eight
or
ten
minutes
,
and
the
sum
of
his
reasoning
came
to
this
:
There
's
no
way
to
take
him
in
now
and
keep
those
other
two
-
Wister
and
the
one
who
hired
the
two
of
them
-
from
finding_out
about
Roberts
and
lamming
out
.
The
local
law
here
would
hold
me
till
they
check
clear
back
home
,
and
maybe
more_than
that
.
They
would
have
to
.
By
then
they
could
never
catch_up_with
the
others
.
There
's
no
other
way
;
I
'll
have
to
do
it
myself
.
He
looked
at
where
Roberts
lay
sprawled
on
the
step
.
Mickey
was
sure
now
he
was
dead
.
One
thing
,
he
thought
,
nobody
knows
about
it
yet
.
Only
me
.
He
climbed
the
stairs
,
went_into
Roberts
'
room
,
found
a
suitcase
and
packed
as
much
into
it
as
he
could
.
He
left
a_few
things
.
It
did
n't
have_to
be
perfect
.
Roberts
was
a
wastrel
.
Walking
away
on
impulse
,
he
might
logically
leave_behind
what
it
was
inconvenient
to
carry
.
When
he
had
closed
the
suitcase
he
found
a
rag
and
moved
about
the
room
,
wiping
carefully
everything
he
might
have
touched
.
It
took
him
nearly
an
hour
.
He
went_to
the
room
he
had
rented
and
got_into
his
overcoat
.
He
left
the
rest
of
his
things
and
returned
to
the
lobby
.
He
set
Roberts
'
suitcase
near
the
front_door
,
went
outside
and
walked
back
to
the
garage
.
He
was
mildly
surprised
to
find
it
was
snowing
.
It
snowed
softly
,
silently
,
an
undulating
interruption
of
his
vision
against
the
night
sky
.
He
could
feel
it
on
his
face
and
in
his
hair
.
He
found
the
key
to
the
Jeep
,
got
it
started
and
warmed
it
up
for
five
minutes
.
Then
he
backed_out
and
swung
around
to
the
front
drive
.
He
went_into
the
hotel
and
searched
till
he
found
the
razor
.
He
put
it
in
his
own
pocket
for
safekeeping
.
He
took
the
suitcase
out
to
the
Jeep
and
put
it
in
the
front
seat
.
Then
he
went_back
for
Roberts
.
The
body
was
heavier
than
he
had
anticipated
.
He
got
it
onto
his
shoulder
after
some
work
and
carried
it
outside
and
down
to
the
Jeep
.
He
dumped
it
into
the
back
and
made
sure
it
would
n't
roll
out
,
then
returned
to
the
porch
and
closed
the
front_door
,
making
sure
it
was
unlocked
.
He
drove
carefully
in
the
direction
of
the
brief
tour
they
had
taken
earlier
.
It
snowed
continuously
,
but
quietly
,
evenly
.
When
he
reached
the
dip
in
the
woods
,
he
saw
that
already
the
earlier
ruts
were
barely
discernible
.
The
Jeep
fought
its
way
through
the
low
spot
and
got
onto
higher
ground
.
He
drove
in
low_gear
to
the
fork
in
the
road
and
swung
as_close_as
possible
to
the
entrance
to
the
abandoned
mine
.
He
parked
facing
it
and
left
the
headlights
on
,
but
when
he
started
into
the
tunnel
with
the
suitcase
,
he
found
the
illumination
extended
no
farther
than
half_a_dozen
feet
into
the
passage
.
He
went_back
and
got
the
flashlight
,
returned
to
the
tunnel
and
carried
the
suitcase
to
the
edge
of
the_pit
he
had
found
earlier
.
He
tossed
the
bag
into
the_pit
and
watched
dry
dust
spray
up
around
it
.
When
the
dust
settled
,
he
went_back
to
the
Jeep
and
carefully
worked
Roberts
'
body
onto
his
shoulder
.
It
was
n't
like
carrying
the
suitcase
.
The
soft
snow
was
deceitful
underfoot
.
Twice
he
nearly
fell
.
Inside
the
passage
,
he
had
to
work
his
way
over
the
fallen
timber
and
nearly
collapsed
under
his
clumsy
burden
.
By
the
time
he
reached
the
edge
of
the_pit
he
was
panting
and
his
shoulder
and
back
ached
under
the
drag
of
the
dead
weight
.
He
stood
looking
down
for
a_few
seconds
,
then
backed_up
two
or
three
paces
from
the
edge
.
There
was
too_much
weight
casually
to
toss
it
away
.
He
could
feel
himself
falling
in
with
it
and
being
unable
to
get_out
.
It
would
be
a
bad
place
to
die
.
It
was
a
bad
place
for
Roberts
to
wind_up
,
but
Roberts
had
asked_for
it
.
It
was
too
late
to
worry
about
that
.
He
knelt
slowly
and
dumped
the
corpse
onto
the
floor
of
the
tunnel
.
It
was
a
relief
to
get_rid_of
the
weight
.
He
was
shaking
with
tension
and
it
took
him
a_couple_of
minutes
to
get
his
breath
and
settle
down
.
Then
he
got
on
his
knees
and
rolled
Roberts
'
body
toward
the
edge
.
It
hung
momentarily
on
the
point
of
dropping
off
.
He
gave
it
a
strong
push
,
heard
it
slide
,
then
tumble
dryly
into
the
hole
.
He
got
to
his
feet
and
threw
the
flashlight
beam
into
the_pit
.
The
body
lay
in
an
awkward
sprawl
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
below
the
level
of
the
tunnel
floor
.
Deep
enough
,
he
decided
.
There
was
little
chance
anyone
would
enter
this
shaft
during
the
winter
.
The
external
signs
of
his
approach
to_it
would
be
covered
by
the
snow
,
probably
by
the
next
day
.
It
was
n't
cold
enough
in
the
tunnel
to
preserve
the
body
intact
.
By
spring
it
would
be
a
skeleton
.
He
made
his
way
back
to
the
Jeep
.
He
had
started
to
back
into
the
turn
when
he
remembered
the
razor
in
his
pocket
.
He
climbed_down
,
went_back
into
the
tunnel
and
tossed
the
razor
into
the_pit
.
It
landed
on
Roberts
'
sprawled
right
thigh
,
poised
precariously
,
then
slid
off
to
the
ground
.
He
went_back
once_more
to
the
Jeep
and
started
the
short
drive
to
the
hotel
.
In
the
garage
he
checked
the
Jeep
for
signs
of
the
use
he
had
made
of_it
.
There
were
stains
here_and_there
and
he
cleaned
them
off
,
using
an
oiled
rag
he
found
on
a
nail
.
He
wiped
the
steering_wheel
and
all
the
places
he
might
have
touched
the
Jeep
.
He
replaced
the
flashlight
where
it
had
been
stowed
,
got
into
his
own
car
and
backed
it
out
of
the
garage
.
There
were
tire
marks
where
it
had
been
,
but
they
were
overlapped
by
others
and
on
the
dusty
floor
would
not
be
noticeable
except
under
close
scrutiny
.
Liz_Peabody
,
he
thought
,
might
spend
some
time
grieving
for
her
lost
lover
,
but
he
doubted
that
she
would
launch
an
investigation
.
He
judged
her
to
be
a
woman
of
some
pride
,
though
not_much
sense
.
Still
she
would
probably
have
sense
enough
not
to
call_in
the
local
sheriff
to
find
her
boy
friend
who
,
apparently
,
had
run_away
.
