There
were
fences
in
the
old
days
when
we
were
children
.
Across
the
front
of
a
yard
and
down
the
side
,
they
were
iron
,
either
spiked
along
the
top
or
arched
in
half
circles
.
Alley
fences
were
made
of
solid
boards
higher
than
one
's
head
,
but
not
so
high
as
the
golden_glow
in
a
corner
or
the
hollyhocks
that
grew
in
a
line
against
them
.
Side
fences
were
hidden
beneath
lilacs
and
hundred_leaf
roses
;
front
fences
were
covered
with
Virginia_creeper
or
trumpet_vines
or
honeysuckle
.
Square
corner
-
and
gate_posts
were
an
open-work
pattern
of
cast-iron
foliage
;
they
were
topped
by
steeples
complete
in
every
detail
:
high_pitched
roof
,
pinnacle
,
and
narrow
gable
.
On
these
posts
the
gates
swung
open
with
a
squeak
and
shut
with
a
metallic
clang
.
The
only
extended
view
possible
to
anyone
less
tall
than
the
fences
was
that
obtained
from
an
upper
bough
of
the
apple_tree
.
The
primary
quality
of
that
view
seems
,
now
,
to
have
been
its
quietness
,
but
that
cannot
at
the
time
have
impressed
us
.
What
one
actually
remembers
is
its
greenness
.
From
high
in
the
tree
,
the
whole
block
lay
within
range
of
the
eye
,
but
the
ground
was
almost
nowhere
visible
.
One
looked
down
on
a
sea
of
leaves
,
a
breaking
wave
of
flower
.
Every
path
from
back
door
to
barn
was
covered
by
a
grape-arbor
,
and
every
yard
had
its
fruit_trees
.
In
the
center
of
any
open
space
remaining
our
grandfathers
had
planted
syringa
and
sweet_shrub
,
snowball
,
rose-of-Sharon
and
balm-of-Gilead
.
From
above
one
could
only
occasionally
catch_a_glimpse
of
life
on
the
floor
of
this
green
sea
:
a
neighbor
's
gingham
skirt
flashing
into
sight
for
an
instant
on
the
path
beneath
her
grape-arbor
,
or
the
movement
of
hands
above
a
clothesline
and
the
flutter
of
garments
hung
there
,
half-way
down
the
block
.
That
was
one
epoch
:
the
apple-tree
epoch
.
Another
had
ended
before
it
began
.
Time
is
a
queer
thing
and
memory
a
queerer
;
the
tricks
that
time
plays_with
memory
and
memory
with
time
are
queerest
of
all
.
From
maturity
one
looks_back
at
the
succession
of
years
,
counts
them
and
makes
them
many
,
yet
cannot
feel
length
in
the
number
,
however
large
.
In
a
stream
that
turns
a
mill-wheel
there
is
a_lot
of
water
;
the
mill-pond
is
quiet
,
its
surface
dark
and
shadowed
,
and
there
does
not
seem
to
be
much
water
in
it
.
Time
in
the
sum
is
nothing
.
And
yet
-
a
year
to
a
child
is
an
eternity
,
and
in
the
memory
that
phase
of
one
's
being
-
a
certain
mental
landscape
-
will
seem
to
have
endured
without
beginning
and
without
end
.
The
part
of
the
mind
that
preserves
dates
and
events
may
remonstrate
,
``
It
could
have
been
like
that
for
only
a_little
while
''
;
but
true
memory
does
not
count
nor
add
:
it
holds
fast
to
things
that
were
and
they
are
outside
of
time
.
Once
,
then
-
for
how
many
years
or
how
few
does
not
matter
-
my
world
was
bound
round
by
fences
,
when
I
was
too
small
to
reach
the
apple_tree
bough
,
to
twist
my
knee
over
it
and
pull
myself
up
.
That
world
was
in
scale
with
my
own
smallness
.
I
have
no
picture
in
my
mind
of
the
garden
as_a_whole
-
that
I
could
not
see
-
but
certain
aspects
of
certain
corners
linger
in
the
memory
:
wind-blown
,
frost-bitten
,
white
chrysanthemums
beneath
a
window
,
with
their
brittle
brown
leaves
and
their
sharp
scent
of
November
;
ripe
pears
lying
in
long
grass
,
to
be
turned_over
by
a
dusty
slippered
foot
,
cautiously
,
lest
bees
still
worked
in
the
ragged
,
brown
edged
holes
;
hot
colored
verbenas
in
the
corner
between
the
dining-room
wall
and
the
side
porch
,
where
we
passed
on_our_way
to
the
pump
with
the
half
gourd
tied
to
it
as
a
cup
by
my
grandmother
for
our
childish
pleasure
in
drinking
from
it
.
It
was
mother
who
planted
the
verbenas
.
I
think
that
my
grandmother
was
not
an
impassioned
gardener
:
she
was
too
indulgent
a
lover
of
dogs
and
grandchildren
.
My
great_grandmother
,
I
have
been
told
,
made
her
garden
her
great
pride
;
she
cherished
rare
and
delicate
plants
like
oleanders
in
tubs
and
wall-flowers
and
lemon
verbenas
in
pots
that
had
to
be
wintered
in
the
cellar
;
she
filled
the
waste
spots
of
the
yard
with
common
things
like
the
garden_heliotrope
in
a
corner
by
the
woodshed
,
and
the
plantain_lilies
along
the
west_side
of
the
house
.
These
my
grandmother
left
in
their
places
(
they
are
still
there
,
more
persistent
and
longer-lived
than
the
generations
of
man
)
and
planted
others
like
them
,
that
flourished
without
careful
tending
.
Three
of
these
only
were
protected
from
us
by
stern
commandment
:
the
roses
,
whose
petals
might_not
be
collected
until
they
had
fallen
,
to
be
made
into
perfume
or
rose
tea
to
drink
;
the
peonies
,
whose
tight
sticky
buds
would
be
blighted
by
the
laying_on
of_a
finger
,
although
they
were
not
apparently
harmed
by
the
ants
that
crawled
over
them
;
and
the
poppies
.
I
have
more_than
once
sat
cross-legged
in
the
grass
through
a
long
summer
morning
and
watched
without
touching
while
a
poppy
bud
higher
than
my
head
slowly
but
visibly
pushed
off
its
cap
,
unfolded
,
and
shook
out
like
a
banner
in
the
sun
its
flaming
vermilion
petals
.
Other
flowers
we
might
gather
as
we
pleased
:
myrtle
and
white_violets
from
beneath
the
lilacs
;
the
lilacs
themselves
,
that
bloomed
so
prodigally
but
for_the_most_part
beyond
our
reach
;
snowballs
;
hollyhock
blossoms
that
,
turned
upside_down
,
make
pink
petticoated
ladies
;
and
the
little
,
dark_blue
larkspur
that
scattered
its
seed
everywhere
.
More
potent
a
charm
to
bring
back
that
time_of_life
than
this
record
of
a_few
pictures
and
a_few
remembered
facts
would
be
a
catalogue
of
the
minutiae
which
are
of
the
very
stuff
of
the
mind
,
intrinsic
,
because
they
were
known
in_the_beginning
not
by
the
eye
alone
but
by
the
hand
that
held
them
.
Flowers
,
stones
,
and
small
creatures
,
living
and
dead
.
Pale
yellow
snapdragons
that
by
pinching
could
be
made
to
bite
;
seed-pods
of
the
balsams
that
snapped
like
fire-crackers
at
a
touch
;
red
and
yellow
columbines
whose
round
tipped
spurs
were
picked_off
and
eaten
for
the
honey
in
them
;
morning-glory
buds
which
could
be
so
grasped
and
squeezed
that
they
burst
like
a
blown-up
paper_bag
;
bright
flowers
from
the
trumpet_vine
that
made
``
gloves
''
on
the
ends
of
ten
waggling
fingers
.
Fuzzy
caterpillars
,
snails
with
their
sensitive
horns
,
struggling
grasshoppers
held
by
their
long
hind_legs
and
commanded
to
``
spit
tobacco
,
spit
''
.
Dead
fledgling
birds
,
their
squashed
looking
nakedness
and
the
odor
of
decay
that
clung_to
the
hand
when
they
had
been
buried
in
our
graveyard
in_front_of
the
purple
flags
.
And
the
cast
shell
of
a
locust
,
straw
colored
and
transparent
,
weighing
nothing
,
fragile
but
entire
,
with
eyes
like
bubbles
and
a
gaping
slit
down
its
back
.
Every
morning
early
,
in
the
summer
,
we
searched
the
trunks
of
the
trees
as
high
as
we
could
reach
for
the
locust
shells
,
carefully
detached
their
hooked
claws
from
the
bark
where
they
hung
,
and
stabled
them
,
a
weird
faery
herd
,
in
an
angle
between
the
high
roots
of
the
tulip_tree
,
where
no
grass
grew
in
the
dense
shade
.
We
collected
``
lucky
stones
''
-
all
the
creamy
translucent
pebbles
,
worn
smooth
and
round
,
that
we
could
find
in
the
driveway
.
When
these
had
been
pocketed
,
we
could
still
spend
a
morning
cracking
open
other
pebbles
for
our
delight
in
seeing
how
much
prettier
they
were
inside
than
their
dull
exteriors
indicated
.
We
showed
them
to
each
other
and
said
``
Would
you
have
guessed
''
?
Squatting
on
our
haunches
beside
the
flat
stone
we
broke
them
on
,
we
were
safe
behind
the
high
closed
gates
at
the
end
of
the
drive
:
safe
from
interruption
and
the
observation
and
possible
amusement
of
the
passers-by
.
Thus
shielded
,
we
played
many
foolish
games
in
comfortable
unselfconsciousness
;
even
when
the
fences
became
a
part
of
the
game
-
when
a
vine
embowered
gate-post
was
the
Sleeping_Beauty
's
enchanted
castle
,
or
when
Rapunzel
let_down
her
golden
hair
from
beneath
the
crocketed
spire
,
even
then
we
paid
little
heed
to
those
who
went_by
on
the
path
outside
.
We
enjoyed
a
paradoxical
freedom
when
we
were
still
too
young
for
school
.
In
the
heat
of
the
summer
,
the
garden
solitudes
were
ours
alone
;
our
elders
stayed
in
the
dark
house
or
sat
fanning
on
the
front_porch
.
They
never
troubled_themselves
about
us
while
we
were
playing
,
because
the
fence
formed
such
a
definite
boundary
and
``
Do
n't
go
outside
the
gate
''
was
a
command
so
impossible
of
misinterpretation
.
We
were
not
,
however
,
entirely
unacquainted_with
the
varying
aspects
of
the
street
.
We
were
forbidden
to
swing
on
the
gates
,
lest
they
sag
on
their
hinges
in
a
poor-white-trash
way
,
but
we
could
stand
on
them
,
when
they
were
latched
,
rest
our
chins
on
the
top
,
and
stare
and
stare
,
committing
to
memory
,
quite
unintentionally
,
all
the
details
that
lay
before
our
eyes
.
The
street
that
is
full
now
of
traffic
and
parked
cars
then
and
for
many
years
drowsed
on
an
August
afternoon
in
the
shade
of
the
curbside
trees
,
and
silence
was
a
weight
,
almost
palpable
,
in
the
air
.
Every
slight
sound
that
rose
against
that
pressure
fell_away
again
,
crushed
beneath
it
.
A
hay
wagon
moved
slowly
along
the
gutter
,
the
top
of
it
swept
by
the
low
boughs
of
the
maple
trees
,
and
loose
straws
were
left
hanging
tangled
among
the
leaves
.
A
wheel
squeaked
on
a
hub
,
was
still
,
and
squeaked
again
.
If
a
child
watched
its
progress
he
whispered
,
``
Hay
,
hay
,
load
of
hay
-
make
a
wish
and
turn_away
''
,
and
then
stared
rigidly
in
the
opposite
direction
until
the
sound
of
the
horses
'
feet
returned
no_more
.
When
the
hay
wagon
had
gone
,
and
an
interval
passed
,
a
huckster
's
cart
might
turn
the
corner
.
The
horse
walked
,
the
reins
were
slack
,
the
huckster
rode
with
bowed
shoulders
,
his
forearms
across
his
knees
.
Sleepily
,
as
if
half
reluctant
to
break
the
silence
,
he
lifted
his
voice
:
``
Rhu-beb
ni_ice
fresh
rhu-beb
today
''
!
The
lazy
sing-song
was
spaced
in
time
like
the
drone
of
a
bumble-bee
.
No
one
seemed
to
hear
him
,
no
one
heeded
.
The
horse
plodded
on
,
and
he
repeated
his
call
.
It
became
so
monotonous
as
to
seem
a
part
of
the
quietness
.
After
his
passage
,
the
street
was
empty
again
.
The
sun
moved
slant-wise
across
the
sky
and
down
;
the
trees
'
shadows
circled
from
street
to
sidewalk
,
from
sidewalk
to
lawn
.
At
four
o_'_clock
,
or
four
thirty
,
the
coming
of
the
newsboy
marked
the
end
of
the
day
;
he
tossed
a
paper
toward
every
front_door
,
and
housewives
came
down
to
their
steps
to
pick
them
up
and
read
what
their
neighbors
had
been
doing
.
The
streets
of
any
county
town
were
like
this
on
any
sunshiny
afternoon
in
summer
;
they
were
like
this
fifty
odd
years
ago
,
and
yesterday
.
But
the
fences
were
still
in_place
fifty
odd
years
ago
,
and
when
we
stood
on
the
gate
to
look
over
,
the
sidewalk
under
our
eyes
was
not
cement
but
two
rows
of
paving_stones
with
grass
between
and
on
both
sides
.
The
curb
was
a
line
of
stone
laid
edgewise
in
the
dirt
and
tilted
this
way
and
that
by
frost
in
the
ground
or
the
roots
of
trees
.
Opposite
every
gate
was
a
hitching_post
or
a
stone
carriage
step
,
set
with
a
rusty
iron
ring
for
tying
a
horse
.
The
street
was
unpaved
and
rose
steeply
toward
the
center
;
it
was
mud
in
wet
weather
and
dust
,
ankle-deep
,
in
dry
,
and
could
be
crossed
only
at
the
corner
where
there
were
stepping_stones
.
It
had
a
bucolic
atmosphere
that
it
has
lost
long_since
.
The
hoofmarks
of
cattle
and
the
prints
of
bare
feet
in
the
mud
or
in
the
dust
were
as
numerous
as
the
traces
of
shod
horses
.
Cows
were
kept
in
backyard
barns
,
boys
were
hired
to
drive
them
to
and
from
the
pasture
on
the
edge
of
town
,
and
familiar
to
the
ear
,
morning
and
evening
,
were
the
boys
'
coaxing
voices
,
the
thud
of
hooves
,
and
the
thwack
of
a
stick
on
cowhide
.
