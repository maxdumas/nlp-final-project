My
interviews
with
teen-agers
confirmed
this
portrait
of
the
weakening
of
religious
and
ethnic
bonds
.
Jewish
identity
was
often
confused
with
social
and
economic
strivings
.
``
Being
Jewish
gives
you
tremendous
drive
''
,
a
boy
remarked
.
``
It
means
that
you
have_to
get_ahead
''
.
When
I
pressed
for
a
purely
religious
definition
,
I
encountered
the
familiar
blend
of
liberal
piety
,
interfaith
good_will
,
and
a
small
residue
of
ethnic
loyalty
.
``
I
like
the
tradition
''
,
a
girl
said
.
``
I
like
to
follow
the
holidays
when
they
come_along
.
But
you
do
n't
have_to
worship
in
the
traditional
way
.
You
can
communicate
in
your
own
way
.
As
I
see
it
,
there
's
no
real
difference
between
being
Jewish
,
Catholic
,
or
Protestant
''
.
Another
teen-ager
remarked
:
``
Most
Jews
do
n't
believe_in
God
,
but
they
believe_in
people
-
in
helping
people
''
.
Still
another
boy
asserted
:
``
To
be
a
good
Jew
is
to
do
no
wrong
;
it
's
to
be
a
good_person
''
.
When
asked
how
this
was
different
from
being
a
good
Protestant
,
the
boy
answered
,
``
It
's
the
same
thing
''
.
This
accords
with
the
study
by
Maier
and
Spinrad
.
They
discovered
that
,
although
42
per_cent
of
a
sample
of
Catholic
students
and
15
per_cent
of
the
Protestants
believed
it
important
to
live
in
accordance
with
the
teachings
of
their
religion
,
only
8
per_cent
of
the
Jewish
students
had
this
conviction
.
The
most
important
aims
of
the
Jewish
students
were
as_follows
:
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
to
live
in
-
30
per_cent
;
to
get
happiness
for
yourself
-
28
per_cent
;
and
financial
independence
-
21
per_cent
.
Nevertheless
,
most_of
the
teen-agers
I
interviewed
believed_in
maintaining
their
Jewish
identity
and
even
envisioned
joining
a
synagogue
or
temple
.
However
,
they
were
hostile
to
Jewish
Orthodoxy
,
professing
to
believe_in
Judaism
``
but
in
a
moderate
way
''
.
One
boy
said
querulously
about
Orthodox
Jews
:
``
It
's
the
twentieth
century
,
and
they
do
n't
have_to
wear
beards
''
.
The
reason
offered
for
clinging
to
the
ancestral
faith
lacked
force
and
authority
even
in
the
teen-agers
'
minds
.
``
We
were
brought_up
that
way
''
was
one
statement
which
won
general
assent
.
``
I
want
to
show
respect
for
my
parents
'
religion
''
was
the
way
in_which
a
boy
justified
his
inhabiting_a_halfway_house
of
Judaism
.
Still
another
suggested
that
he
would
join
a
temple
``
for
social
reasons
,
since
I
'll
be
living
in
a
suburb
''
.
Intermarriage
,
which
is
generally
regarded_as
a
threat
to
Jewish
survival
,
was
regarded
not
with
horror
or
apprehension
but
with
a
kind
of
mild
,
clinical
disapproval
.
Most_of
the
teen-agers
I
interviewed
rejected
it
on
pragmatic
grounds
.
``
When
you
marry
,
you
want
to
have
things
in
common
''
,
a
girl
said
,
``
and
it
's
hard
when
you
do
n't
marry
someone
with
your
own
background
''
.
A
fourteen
year
old
girl
from
the
Middle_West
observed
wryly
that
,
in
her
community
,
religion
inconveniently
interfered
with
religious
activities
-
at_least
with
the
peripheral
activities
that
many
middle_class
Jews
now
regard_as
religious
.
It
appears
that
an
Orthodox
girl
in
the
community
disrupted
plans
for
an
outing
sponsored
by
one
of
the
Jewish
service
groups
because
she
would
not
travel
on
Saturday
and
,
in_addition
,
required
kosher
food
.
Another
girl
from
a
relatively
large
midwestern
city
described
herself
as
``
the
only
Orthodox
girl
in
town
''
.
This
is
,
no_doubt
,
inaccurate
,
but
it
does
convey
how
isolated
she
feels
among
the
vast
army
of
the
nonobservant
.
One
of
the
significant
things
about
Jewish
culture
in
the
older
teen
years
is
that
it
is
largely
college
oriented
.
Sixty_five
per_cent
of
the
Jewish
teen-agers
of
college
age
attend
institutions
of
higher
learning
.
This
is
substantially
higher
than
the
figures
for
the
American
population
at_large
-
45.6
per_cent
for
males
and
29.2
per_cent
for
females
.
This
may
help
explain
a
phenomenon
described
by
a
small_town
Jewish
boy
.
In
their
first
two
years
in
high_school
,
Jewish
boys
in
this
town
make
strenuous
exertions
to
win
positions
on
the
school
teams
.
However
,
in
their
junior
and
senior
years
,
they
generally
forego
their
athletic
pursuits
,
presumably
in
the
interest
of
better
academic
achievement
.
It
is
significant
,
too
,
that
the
older
teen-agers
I
interviewed
believed
,
unlike
the
younger
ones
,
that
Jewish
students
tend
to
do
better
academically
than
their
gentile
counterparts
.
The
percentage
of
Jewish
girls
who
attend
college
is
almost
as
high
as
that
of
boys
.
The
motivations
for
both
sexes
,
to_be_sure
,
are
different
.
The
vocational
motive
is
the
dominant
one
for
boys
,
while
Jewish
girls
attend
college
for
social
reasons
and
to
become
culturally
developed
.
One
of
the
significant
developments
in
American
Jewish
life
is
that
the
cultural
consumers
are
largely
the
women
.
It
is
they
who
read
-
and
make
-
Jewish
best-sellers
and
then
persuade
their
husbands
to
read
them
.
In
upper
teen
Jewish
life
,
the
non
college
group
tends
to
have
a
sense
of
marginality
.
``
People
automatically
assume
that
I
'm
in
college
''
,
a
nineteen
year
old
machinist
observed
irritably
.
However
,
among
the
girls
,
there
are
some
morale
enhancing
compensations
for
not
going_to
college
.
The
Jewish
working_girl
almost
invariably
works
in
an
office
-
in
contradistinction
to
gentile
factory_workers
-
and
,
buttressed
by
a
respectable
income
,
she
is
likely
to
dress
better
and
live
more
expansively
than
the
college_student
.
She
is
even
prone
to
regard
the
college_girl
as
immature
.
One
of
the
reasons
for
the
high
percentage
of
Jewish
teen-agers
in
college
is
that
a
great
many
urban
Jews
are
enabled
to
attend
local
colleges
at
modest
cost
.
This
is
particularly
true
in
large
centers
of
Jewish
population
like
New_York
,
Chicago
,
and
Philadelphia
.
What
is
noteworthy
about
this
large
group
of
teen-agers
is
that
,
although
their
attitudes
hardly
differentiate
them
from
their
gentile
counterparts
,
they
actually
lead
their
lives
in
a
vast
self_enclosed
Jewish
cosmos
with
relatively
little
contact
with
the
non
Jewish
world
.
Perhaps
the
Jewish
students
at
Brooklyn_College
-
constituting
85
per_cent
of
those
who
attend
the
day
session
-
can
serve
as
a
paradigm
of
the
urban
,
lower_middle_class
Jewish
student
.
There
is
,
to
begin
,
an
important
sex
difference
.
Typically
,
in
a
lower-middle_class
Jewish
family
,
a
son
will
be
sent
to
an
out-of-town
school
,
if
financial
resources
warrant
it
,
while
the
daughter
will
attend
the
local
college
.
There
are
two
reasons
for
this
.
First
,
the
girl
's
education
has
a
lower
priority
than
the
son
's
.
Second
,
the
attitude
in
Jewish
families
is
far
more
protective
toward
the
daughter
than
toward
the
son
.
Most
Jewish
mothers
are
determined
to
exercise
vigilance
over
the
social
and
sexual
lives
of
their
daughters
by
keeping
them
home
.
The
consequence
of
this
is
that
the
girls
at
Brooklyn_College
outnumber
the
boys
and
do
somewhat
better
academically
.
One
can
assume
that
some
of
the
brightest
boys
are
out
of
town
.
Brooklyn_College
students
have
an
ambivalent
attitude
toward
their
school
.
On_the_one_hand
,
there
is
a
sense
of
not
having
moved
beyond
the
ambiance
of
their
high_school
.
This
is
particularly
acute
for
those
who
attended
Midwood_High_School
directly
across
the
street
from
Brooklyn_College
.
They
have
a
sense
of
marginality
at
being
denied
that
special
badge
of
status
,
the
out-of-town
school
.
At_the_same_time
,
there
is
a
good_deal
of
self
congratulation
at
attending
a
good
college
-
they
are
even
inclined
to
exaggerate
its
not
inconsiderable
virtues
-
and
they
express
pleasure
at
the
cozy
in-group
feeling
that
the
college
generates
.
``
It
's
people
of
your
own
kind
''
,
a
girl
remarked
.
``
You
do
n't
have_to
watch
what
you
say
.
Of_course
,
I
would
like
to
go_to
an
out-of-town
school
where
there
are
all
kinds
of
people
,
but
I
would
want
lots
of
Jewish
kids
there
''
.
For
most
Brooklyn_College
students
,
college
is
at_once
a
perpetuation
of
their
ethnic
attachments
and
a
breaking_away
from
the
cage
of
neighborhood
and
family
.
Brooklyn_College
is
unequivocally
Jewish
in
tone
,
and
efforts
to
detribalize
the
college
by
bringing_in
unimpeachably
midwestern
types
on
the
faculty
have
been
unavailing
.
However
,
a
growing
intellectual
sophistication
and
the
new
certitudes
imparted
by
courses
in
psychology
and
anthropology
make
the
students
increasingly
critical
of
their
somewhat
provincial
and
overprotective
parents
.
And
the
rebellion
of
these
third
generation
Jews
is
not
the
traditional
conflict
of
culture
but
,
rather
,
a
protest
against
a
culture
that
they
view_as
softly
and
insidiously
enveloping
.
``
As_long_as
I
'm
home
,
I
'll
never
grow_up
''
,
a
nineteen
year
old
boy
observed
sadly
.
``
They
do
n't
like
it
if
I
do
anything
away
from
home
.
It
's
so
much
trouble
,
I
do
n't
usually
bother
''
.
For
girls
,
the
overprotection
is
far
more
pervasive
.
Parents
will
drive
on
Friday
night
to
pick_up
their
daughters
after
a
sorority
or
House
Plan
meeting
.
A
freshman
girl
's
father
not
too
long_ago
called
a
dean
at
Brooklyn_College
and
demanded
the
``
low-down
''
on
a
boy
who
was
going_out
with
his
daughter
.
The
domestic
tentacles
even
extend
to
the
choice
of
a
major
field
.
Under
pressure
from
parents
,
the
majority
of
Brooklyn_College
girls
major
in
education
since
that
co-ordinates
best
with
marriage
plans
-
limited
graduate
study
requirement
and
convenient
working
hours
.
This
means
that
a
great
many
academically
talented
girls
are
discouraged
from
pursuing
graduate
work
of
a
more
demanding
nature
.
A
kind
of
double_standard
exists
here
for
Jewish
boys
and
girls
as
it
does
in
the
realm
of
sex
.
The
breaking_away
from
the
prison_house
of
Brooklyn
is
gradual
.
First
,
the
student
trains
on
his
hapless
parents
the
heavy
artillery
of
his
newly
acquired
psychological
and
sociological
insights
.
Then
,
with
the
new
affluence
,
there
is
actually
a
sallying_forth
into
the
wide
,
wide
world
beyond
the
precincts
of
New_York
.
It
is
significant
that
the
Catskills
,
which
used_to
be
the
summer
playground
for
older
teen-agers
,
a
kind
of
summer
suburb
of
New_York
,
no_longer
attracts
them
in
great
numbers
-
except
for
those
who
work
there
as
waiters
,
bus_boys
,
or
counselors
in
the
day_camps
.
The
great
world
beyond
beckons
.
But
it
should
be
pointed_out
that
some
of
the
new
watering_places
-
Fire_Island
,
Nantucket
,
Westhampton
,
Long_Island
,
for_example
-
tend
to
be
homogeneously
Jewish
.
Although
Brooklyn_College
does
not_yet
have
a
junior
year
abroad
program
,
a
good
number
of
students
spend
summers
in
Europe
.
In_general
,
however
,
the
timetable
of
travel
lags
considerably
behind
that
of
the
student
at
Harvard
or
Smith
.
And
acculturation
into
the
world
at_large
is
likely
to
occur
for
the
Brooklyn_College
student
after
college
rather_than
during
the
four
school_years
.
Brooklyn_College
is
Marjorie_Morningstar
territory
,
as
much_as
the_Bronx
or
Central_Park_West
.
There
are
hordes
of
nubile
young_women
there
who
,
prodded
by
their
impatient
mothers
,
are
determined
to
marry
.
It
is
interesting
that
,
although
the
percentage
of
married
students
is
not
appreciably
higher
at
Brooklyn
than
elsewhere
-
about
30
per_cent
of
the
women
and
25
per_cent
of
the
men
in
the
graduating_class
-
the
anxiety
of
the
unmarried
has
puffed_up
the
estimate
.
``
Almost
everybody
in
the
senior_class
is
married
''
,
students
say
dogmatically
.
And
the
school
newspaper
sells
space
to
jubilant
fraternities
,
sororities
,
and
houses
(
in
the
House_Plan_Association
)
that
have
good
news
to
impart
.
These
announcements
are
,
in_effect
,
advertisements
for
themselves
as
thriving
marriage_marts
.
There
are
boxed
proclamations
in
the
newspaper
of
watchings
,
pinnings
,
ringings
,
engagements
,
and
marriages
in
a
scrupulously
graded
hierarchy
of
felicity
.
``
Witt_House
happily
announces
the
engagement
of
Fran_Horowitz
to
Erwin_Schwartz
of
Fife_House
''
.
The
Brooklyn_College
student
shows
some
striking
departures
from
prevailing
collegiate
models
.
The
Ivy_League
enjoys
no
easy
dominion
here
,
and
the
boys
are
as
likely
to
dress
in
rather
foppish
Continental
fashion
,
or
even
in
nondescript
working_class
manner
,
as
they
are
in
the
restrained
,
button-down
Ivy
way
.
The
girls
are
prone
to
dress
far
more
flamboyantly
than
their
counterparts
out
of
town
,
and
eye_shadow
,
mascara
,
and
elaborate
bouffant
hairdos
-
despite
the
admonitions
of
cautious
guidance
personnel
-
are
not
unknown
even
in
early
morning
classes
.
Among
the
boys
,
there
is
very
little
bravado
about
drinking
.
Brooklyn_College
is
distinctive
for
not
having
an
official
drinking
place
.
The
Fort_Lauderdale
encampment
for
drinking
is
foreign
to
most
Brooklyn_College
boys
.
