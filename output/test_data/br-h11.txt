Another
recent
achievement
was
the
successful
development
of
a
method
for
the
complete
combustion
in
a
bomb_calorimeter
of
a
metal
in
fluorine
when
the
product
is
relatively
non-volatile
.
This
work
gave
a
heat_of_formation
of
aluminum
fluoride
which
closely
substantiates
a
value
which
had
been
determined
by
a
less
direct
method
,
and
raises
this
property
to
15
percent
above
that
accepted
a_few
years
ago
.
Similar
measurements
are
being
initiated
to
resolve
a
large
discrepancy
in
the
heat_of_formation
of
another
important
combustion
product
,
beryllium
fluoride
.
The
development
and
testing
of
new
apparatus
to
measure
other
properties
is
nearing
completion
.
In
one
of
these
,
an
exploding
wire
device
to
study
systems
thermodynamically
up_to
6000
*
*
f
and
100
atmospheres
pressure
,
a
major
goal
was
achieved
.
The
accuracy
of
measuring
the
total
electrical
energy
entering
an
exploding
wire
during
a_few
microseconds
was
verified
when
two
independent
types
of
comparison
with
the
heat_energy
produced
had
an
uncertainty
of
less_than
2
percent
.
This
agreement
is
considered
very
good
for
such
short
time
intervals
.
The
method
of
calibration
employs
a
fixed
resistance
element
as
a
calorimeter
.
The
element
is
inserted
in
the
discharge
circuit
in_place_of
the
exploding
wire
,
and
the
calorimetric
heating
of
the
element
is
measured
with
high
accuracy
.
This
is
used
as
a
reference
for
comparing
the
ohmic
heating
and
the
electrical
energy
obtained
from
the
measured
current
through
the
element
and
the
measured
voltage
across
the
element
.
A
high-speed
shutter
has
been
developed
in_order
to
permit
photographic
observation
of
any
portion
of
the
electrical
wire
explosion
.
The
shutter
consists_of
two
parts
:
a
fast
opening
part
and
a
fast
closing
part
.
Using
Edgerton
's
method
,
the
fast
closing
action
is
obtained
from
the
blackening
of
a
window
by
exploding
a
series
of
parallel
lead
wires
.
The
fast
opening
of
the
shutter
consists_of
a
piece
of
aluminum_foil
(
approximately
*
*
f
)
placed
directly
in_front
of
the
camera_lens
so
that
no
light
may
pass
into
the
camera
.
The
opening
action
is
obtained
when
a
capacitor
,
charged
to
high
voltage
,
is
suddenly
discharged
through
the
foil
.
During
the
discharge
the
magnetic_forces
set_up
by
the
passage
of
current
cause
the
edges
of
the
foil
to
roll
inward
toward
its
center_line
,
thus
allowing
light
to
pass
into
the
camera
.
Experiments
have
shown
that
the
shutter
is
75
percent
open
in
about
60
-
80
microseconds
.
The
shutter
aperture
may
be
made
larger
or
smaller
by
changing
the
foil
area
and
adjusting
the
electrical
energy
input
to
the
foil
.
Besides
the
well-known
hydrogen
line
at
21
cm
wavelength
,
the
spectra
of
extraterrestrial
radio_sources
may
contain
sharp
lines
characteristic
of
other
atoms
,
ions
,
and
small
molecules
.
The
detection
and
study
of
such
line
spectra
would
add
considerably
to
present
information
on
interstellar
gas
clouds
and
,
perhaps
,
planetary
atmospheres
.
Among
the
most
likely
producers
of
detectable
radio
line
spectra
are
the
light
diatomic
hydrides
OH
and
CH
;
somewhat
less
likely
sources
are
the
heavier
hydrides
SH
,
SiH
,
and
ScH
.
Very
small
concentrations
of
these
hydrides
should
be
detectable
;
in
interstellar
gas
,
concentrations
as
low
as
*
*
f
molecules
/
*
*
f
may
be
sufficient
,
as
compared
to
the
*
*
f
hydrogen_atoms
*
*
f
required
for
detection
of
the
21
-
cm
line
.
High
sensitivity
in
radio_telescopes
is
achieved
by
reducing
the
bandwidth
of
the
receiver
;
therefore
,
only
with
precise
foreknowledge
of
the
line
frequencies
is
an
astronomical
search
for
the
radio_spectra
of
these
molecules
feasible
.
To
secure
precise
measurements
of
these
frequencies
,
a
research
program
in
free_radical
microwave
spectroscopy
has
been
started
.
Since
conventional
methods
are
insensitive
at
the
low_frequencies
of
these
molecular
transitions
,
the
paramagnetic
resonance
method
is
being
used
instead
.
This
involves
the
application
of
a
strong
magnetic_field
to
the
radical
vapor
,
which
shifts
the
low-frequency
spectra
to
a
conveniently
high
microwave
range
,
where
they
may
be
measured
with
optimum
sensitivity
.
The
first
diatomic
hydride
investigated
by
the
paramagnetic
resonance
method
was
the
OH
radical
.
Results
of_this
experiment
include
the
frequencies
of
the
two
strong
spectral
lines
by
which
OH
may
be
identified
in
interstellar
gas
;
the
frequencies
are
1665.32
and
1667.36
*
*
f
,
with
an
uncertainty
of
0.10
*
*
f
.
Success
in
observing
these
spectral
lines
has
so_far
,
apparently
,
been
confined
to
the
laboratory
;
extraterrestrial
observations
have
yet
to
be
reported
.
Preparations
are
being
made
for
similar
experiments
on
CH
and
SH
radicals
.
The
Bureau
is
pursuing
an
active
program
to
provide
a
temperature
scale
and
thermometer
calibration
services
in
the
range
1.5
to

*
*
f
.
The
efforts
and
accomplishments
fall_into
three
main
categories
:
absolute
thermometry
based
upon
the
velocity
of
sound
in
helium
gas
,
secondary
thermometry
involving
principally
studies
of
the
behavior
of
germanium
resistors
,
and
helium
4
vapor-pressure
measurements
(
see
p.
144
)
.
An
acoustical
interferometer
has
been
constructed
and
used
,
with
helium
gas
as
the
thermometric
fluid
,
to
measure
temperatures
near
4.2
and
2.1
*
*
f
.
Such
an
interferometer
provides
a
means
of
absolute_temperature
measurement
,
and
may
be
used
as_an_alternative
to
the
gas_thermometer
.
When
values
of
temperature
derived
with
this
instrument
were
compared
with
the
accepted
values
associated
with
liquid
helium
4
vapor_pressures
,
differences
of
about
10
and
7
millidegrees
respectively
were
found
.
This
result
is
preliminary
,
and
work
is
continuing
.
Carbon
resistors
and
impurity
doped
germanium
resistors
have
been
investigated
for
use
as
precision
secondary
thermometers
in
the
liquid
helium
temperature
region
.
Several
germanium
resistors
have
been
thermally
cycled
from
300
to
4.2
*
*
f
and
their
resistances
have
been
found
to
be
reproducible
within
1
3
millidegree
when
temperatures
were
derived
from
a
vapor_pressure
thermometer
whose
tubing
is
jacketed
through
most_of
the
liquid
helium
.
Preliminary
calibrations
of
the
resistors
have
been
made
from
4.21
to
2.16
*
*
f
at
every
0.1
*
*
f
.
The
estimated
standard_deviations
of
the
data
for
two
of
the
resistors
were
1
millidegree
;
and
for
the
third
resistor
,
3.3
millidegrees
.
The
reproducibilities
of
helium
vapor-pressure
thermometers
have
been
investigated
in
conjunction
with
a
``
constant
temperature
''
liquid
helium
bath
from
4.2
to
1.8
*
*
f
.
Surface
temperature_gradients
have
been
found
to
exist
in
liquid
helium
baths
contained
in
15
-
and
25
-
liter
metallic
storage
dewars
.
The
gradient
was
about
one_half
of
a
millidegree
at
4.2
*
*
f
but
increased
to
several
millidegrees
for
bath
temperatures
slightly
greater
than
the
|
l
point
.
A
hydrostatic_head
correction
has
been
neither
necessary
nor
applicable
in
the
determination
of
vapor_pressures
or
temperatures
for
the
bulk
liquid
helium
.
However
,
the
surface
temperature_gradient
can
produce
erroneous
vapor-pressure
measurements
for
the
bulk
liquid
helium
unless
precautions
are
taken
to
isolate
the
tube
(
which
passes_through
the
surface
to
the
vapor_pressure
bulb
)
from
the
liquid
helium
surface
.
It
has
also
been
observed
,
in
helium
2
,
,
that
large
discrepancies
can
exist
between
surface
vapor_pressures
and
those
pressures
measured
by
a
vapor_pressure
thermometer
.
This
has
been
attributed
to
helium
film
flow
in
the
vapor_pressure
thermometer
.
In
this
case
also
the
design
of
the
thermometer
can
be
modified
to
reduce
the
helium
film
flow
.
Precise
pressure
volume
temperature
measurements
on
corrosive
gases
are
dependent_on
a
sensitive
yet
rugged
pressure
transducer
.
A
prototype
which
fulfills
the
requirements
was
developed
and
thoroughly
tested
.
The
transducer
is
a
null
type
instrument
and
employs
a
stretched
diaphragm
,
0.001

and
1

A
small
pressure
unbalance
displaces
the
diaphragm

capacitance
between
the
diaphragm
and
an
electrically
insulated
plate
spaced

Spherical
concave
backing
surfaces
support
the
diaphragm
when
excessive
pressures
are
applied
and
prevent
the
stresses
within
the
diaphragm
from
exceeding
the
elastic
limit
.

A

and
had
as
its
goal
the
investigation
of
the
transport
by
diffusion
of
the
heat_energy

A
significant
effect
discovered
during
the
study

the
existence
of
Prandtl
numbers
reaching
values
of
more_than
unity
in
the
nitrogen
dissociation
region

Another
effect
discovered
is
the
large
coefficient

thermal
diffusion
tending

separate
nitrogen

As
a
first_step
toward

arrangements
were
worked_out
for
comparing
the
scales
now
in_use

circulation
of
a
group
of
standard

Such
a

was
obtained
and
calibrated
at

These

have
now
been
sent
to
the

,
Columbus
,
Ohio
was
the
site
of
the
Fourth_Symposium_on_Temperature

following
which
a

papers
were
given
throughout

interactions
of

strengthened
its
activities

The
programs
in
infrared

are
undergoing
reorientation
toward
wavelength
standards
in
the
far
infrared
,
the
application
of
infrared
techniques
to
solid_state

and
increased
emphasis
on
high

Two
data
centers
have
been
established
for
the
collection

critical
evaluation

and
dissemination
of

critical
values
in
the
fields

Under
the
sponsorship
of
the
Office_of_Naval_Research
and
the
Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency
,
a
data
center
was
established
to
gather
and
index
all
published
information
on
atomic
transition
probabilities
.
An
exhaustive
survey
was
made
of
the
literature
,
and
a
primary
reference
file
of
approximately
600
references
was
catalogued
.
Selected
bibliographies
and
tables
of
available
data
are
now
in
preparation
.
A
wall
stabilized
high
current
arc
source
was
constructed
and
used
to
study
transition
probabilities
of
atomic
hydrogen
and
oxygen
.
This
apparatus
will
also
be
used
to
measure
transition
probabilities
of
a
large_number
of
other
elements
.
A
study
of
the
hydrogen
line
profiles
indicates
that
a
measurement
of
these
profiles
can
be
used
to
calculate
a
temperature
for
the
arc
plasma
that
is
reliable
to
about

f
percent
.
A
set
of
tables
containing
spectral
intensities
for
39000
lines
of
70
elements
,
as
observed
in
a
copper
matrix
in
a
d-c
arc
,
was
completed
and
published
.
Studies
of
the
intensity
data
indicate
that
they
may
be
converted
to
approximate
transition
probabilities
.
These
data
are
not
of
the
precision
obtainable
by
the
methods
previously
mentioned
,
but
the
vast
number
of
approximate
values
available
will
be
useful
in
many
areas
.
Research
continues
on
the
very
complex
spectra
of
the
rare_earth
elements
.
New
computer
and
automation
techniques
were
applied
to
these
spectra
with
considerable
success
.
