Since
emotional
reactions
in
the
higher
vertebrates
depend_on
individual
experience
and
are
aroused
in
man
,
in_addition
,
by
complex
symbols
,
one
would
expect
that
the
hypothalamus
could
be
excited
from
the
cortex
.
In
experiments
with
topical
application
of
strychnine
on
the
cerebral_cortex
,
the
transmission
of
impulses
from
the
cortex
to
the
hypothalamus
was
demonstrated
.
Moreover
,
the
responsiveness
of
the
hypothalamus
to
nociceptive
stimulation
is
greatly
increased
under
these
conditions
.
Even
more
complex
and
obviously
cortically
induced
forms
of
emotional_arousal
could
be
elicited
in
monkey
A
on
seeing
monkey
B
(
but
not
a
rabbit
)
in
emotional
stress
.
A
previously
extinguished
conditioned_reaction
was
restored
in
monkey
A
and
was
associated
with
typical
signs
of
emotional
excitement
including
sympathetic
discharges
.
It
seems
to
follow
that
by_and_large
an
antagonism
exists
between
the
paleo
-
and
the
neocortex
as_far_as
emotional
reactivity
is
concerned
,
and
that
the
balance
between
the
two
systems
determines
the
emotional
responsiveness
of
the
organism
.
In_addition
,
the
neocortical
hypothalamic
relations
play
a
great
role
in
primates
,
as
Mirsky
's
interesting
experiment
on
the
``
communication
of
affect
''
demonstrates
.
But
even
in
relatively
primitive
laboratory
animals
such_as
the
rat
,
sex_activity
closely
identified
with
the
hypothalamus
and
the
visceral_brain
is
enhanced
by
the
neocortex
.
MacLean
stressed
correctly
the
importance
of
the
visceral_brain
for
preservation
of
the
individual
and
the
species
,
as
evidenced
by
the
influence
of
the
limbic_brain
(
including
the
hypothalamus
)
on
emotions
related_to
fight
and
flight
and
also
on
sexual
functions
.
It
should
be
added
that
in
man
neocortical
hypothalamic
interrelations
probably
play
a
role
in
the
fusion
of
emotional
processes
with
those
underlying
perception
,
memory
,
imagination
,
and
creativity
.
Previous
experiences
are
obviously
of
great
importance
for
the
qualitative
and
quantitative
emotional
response
.
The
visceral_brain
as_well_as
the
neocortex
is
known
to
contribute
to
memory
,
but
this
topic
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper
.
After
this
brief
discussion
of
neo
-
,
paleocortical
,
and
cortico-hypothalamic
relations
,
let
us
return
once_more
to
the
problem
of
hypothalamic
balance
and
its
physiological
and
pathological
significance
.
Facilitatory
processes
take_place
between
neocortex
and
hypothalamus
via
ascending
and
descending
pathways
.
Thus
cortico-fugal
discharges
induced
by
topical
application
of
strychnine
to
a
minute
area
in
the
neocortex
summate
with
spikes
present
in
the
hypothalamus
and
cause
increased
convulsive
discharges
.
On_the_other_hand
,
the
temporary
reduction
in
hypothalamic
excitability
through
the
injection
of
a
barbiturate
into
the
posterior
hypothalamus
causes
a
lessening
in
frequency
and
amplitude
of
cortical
strychnine
spikes
until
the
hypothalamic
excitability
is
restored
.
Apparently
,
a
positive_feedback
exists
between
the
posterior
hypothalamus
and
the
cerebral_cortex
.
Consequently
,
if
for
any
reason
the
hypothalamic
excitability
falls
below
the
physiological
level
,
the
lessened
hypothalamic
cortical
discharges
lead
to
a
diminished
state
of
activity
in
the
cortex
with
consequent
reduction
in
the
cortico-fugal
discharges
.
Obviously
,
a
vicious_cycle
develops
.
This
tendency
can
be
broken
either
by
restoring
hypothalamic
excitability
directly
or
via
cortico-hypothalamic
pathways
.
It
is
believed
that
drug
therapy
and
electroshock
involve
the
former
and
psychotherapy
the
latter
mechanism
.
Before
we
comment
further
on
these
pathological
conditions
,
we
should
remember
that
changes
in
the
state
of
the
hypothalamus
within
physiological
limits
distinguish
sleep
from
wakefulness
.
Thus
,
a
low
intensity
of
hypothalamic
cortical
discharges
prevails
in
sleep
and
a
high
one
during
wakefulness
,
resulting
in
synchronous
EEG
potentials
in
the
former
and
asynchrony
in
the
latter
condition
.
Moreover
,
the
dominance
in
parasympathetic
action
(
with
reciprocal
inhibition
of
the
sympathetic
)
at
the
hypothalamic
level
induces
,
by
its
peripheral
action
,
the
autonomic
symptoms
of
sleep
and
,
by
its
action
on
the
cortex
,
a
lessening
in
the
reactivity
of
the
sensory
and
motor
apparatus
of
the
somatic
nervous_system
.
With
the
dominance
of
the
sympathetic
division
of
the
hypothalamus
,
the
opposite
changes
occur
.
Since
electrical
stimulation
of
the
posterior
hypothalamus
produces
the
effects
of
wakefulness
while
stimulation
of
the
anterior
hypothalamus
induces
sleep
,
it
may
be
said
that
the
reactivity
of
the
whole
organism
is
altered
by
a
change
in
the
autonomic
reactivity
of
the
hypothalamus
.
Similar
effects
can
be
induced
reflexly
via
the
baroreceptor
reflexes
in
man
and
animals
.
Of
particular
importance
is
the
study
of
the
actions
of
drugs
in
this
respect
.
Although
no
drugs
act
exclusively
on
the
hypothalamus
or
a
part
of
it
,
there
is
sufficient
specificity
to
distinguish
drugs
which
shift
the
hypothalamic
balance
to
the
sympathetic
side
from
those
which
produce
a
parasympathetic
dominance
.
The
former
comprise
analeptic
and
psychoactive_drugs
,
the
latter
the
tranquilizers
.
Specific
differences
exist
in
the
action
of
different
drugs
belonging_to
the
same
group
as
,
for_instance
,
between
reserpine
and
chlorpromazine
.
Important
as
these
differences
are
,
they
should
not
obscure
the
basic
fact
that
by
shifting
the
hypothalamic
balance
sufficiently
to
the
parasympathetic
side
,
we
produce
depressions
,
whereas
a
shift
in
the
opposite
direction
causes
excitatory
effects
and
,
eventually
,
maniclike
changes
.
The
emotional_states
produced
by
drugs
influence
the
cortical_potentials
in
a
characteristic
manner
;
synchrony
prevails
in
the
EEG
of
the
experimental
animal
after
administration
of
tranquilizers
,
but
asynchrony
after
application
of
analeptic
and
psychoactive_drugs
.
The
shock_therapies
act
likewise
on
the
hypothalamic
balance
.
Physiological
experiments
and
clinical
observations
have
shown
that
these
procedures
influence
the
hypothalamically
controlled
hypophyseal
secretions
and
increase
sympathetic
discharges
.
They
shift
the
hypothalamic
balance
to
the
sympathetic
side
.
This
explains
the
beneficial
effect
of
electroshock_therapy
in
certain
depressions
and
a
shift
in
the
reaction
from
hypo
-
to
normal
reactivity
of
the
sympathetic
system
as
shown
by
the
Mecholyl_test
.
Some
investigators
have
found
a
parallelism
between
remissions
and
return
of
the
sympathetic
reactivity
of
the
hypothalamus
to
the
normal
level
as
indicated
by
the
Mecholyl_test
and
,
conversely
,
between
clinical
impairment
and
increasing
deviation
of
this
test
from
the
norm
.
Nevertheless
,
the
theory
that
the
determining
influence
of
the
hypothalamic
balance
has
a
profound
influence
on
the
clinical
behavior
of
neuropsychiatric
patients
has
not_yet
been
tested
on
an
adequate
number
of
patients
.
The
Mecholyl
and
noradrenalin
tests
applied
with
certain
precautions
are
reliable
indicators
of
this
central
autonomic
balance
,
but
for
the
sake
of
correlating
autonomic
and
clinical
states
,
and
of
studying
the
effect
of
certain
therapeutic
procedures
on
central
autonomic
reactions
,
additional
tests
seem
to
be
desirable
.
It
was
assumed
that
the
shift
in
autonomic
hypothalamic
balance
occurring
spontaneously
in
neuropsychiatric
patients
from
the
application
of
certain
therapeutic
procedures
follows
the
pattern
known
from
the
sleep
wakefulness
cycle
.
A
change
in
the
balance
to
the
parasympathetic
side
leads
in
the
normal
individual
to
sleep
or
,
in
special
circumstances
,
to
cardiovascular
collapse
or
nausea
and
vomiting
.
In
both
conditions
the
emotional
and
perceptual
sensitivity
is
diminished
,
but
no
depression
occurs
such_as
is
seen
clinically
or
may
be
produced
in
normal
persons
by
drugs
.
The
fundamental
differences
between
physiological
and
pathological
states
of
parasympathetic
(
and
also
of
sympathetic
)
dominance
remain
to
be
elucidated
.
Perhaps
a
clue
to
these
and
related
problems
lies_in
the
fact
that
changes
in
the
intensity
of
hypothalamic
discharges
which
are
associated
with
changes
in
its
balance
lead
also
to
qualitative
alterations
in
reactivity
.
A
state
of
parasympathetic
``
tuning
''
of
the
hypothalamus
induced
experimentally
causes
not_only
an
increase
in
the
parasympathetic
reactivity
this
structure
to
direct
and
reflexly
induced
stimuli
,
but
leads
also
to
an
autonomic
reversal
:
a
stimulus
acting
sympathetically
under
control_conditions
elicits
in
this
state
of
tuning
a
parasympathetic
response
!
Furthermore
,
conditioned_reactions
are
fundamentally
altered
when
the
hypothalamic
sympathetic
reactivity
is
augmented
beyond
a
critical
level
,
and
several
types
of
behavioral
changes
probably
related_to
the
degree
of
central
autonomic
``
tuning
''
are
observed
.
If
,
for_instance
,
such
a
change
is
produced
by
one
or
a_few
insulin
comas
or
electroshocks
,
previously
inhibited
conditioned_reactions
reappear
.
However
,
if
these
procedures
are
applied
more
often
,
conditioned
emotional
responses
are
temporarily
abolished
.
In
other
studies
,
loss
of
differentiation
in
previously
established
conditioned_reflexes
resulted
from
repeated
convulsive
(
metrazol
)
treatments
,
suggesting
a
fundamental
disturbance
in
the
balance
between
excitatory
and
inhibitory
cerebral
processes
.
It
has
further
been
shown
that
:
(
1
)
an
experimental
neurosis
in
its
initial
stages
is
associated
with
a
reversible
shift
in
the
central
autonomic
balance
;
(
2
)
drugs
altering
the
hypothalamic
balance
alter
conditioned_reactions
;
(
3
)
in
a
state
of
depression
,
the
positive
conditioned_stimulus
may
fail
to
elicit
a
conditioned_reaction
but
cause
an
increased
synchrony
instead
of
the
excitatory
desynchronizing
(
alerting
)
effect
on
the
EEG
.
These
are
few
and
seemingly
disjointed
data
,
but
they
illustrate
the
important
fact
that
fundamental
alterations
in
conditioned_reactions
occur
in
a
variety
of
states
in
which
the
hypothalamic
balance
has
been
altered
by
physiological
experimentation
,
pharmacological
action
,
or
clinical
processes
.
The
foregoing
remarks
imply
that
the
hypothalamic
balance
plays
a
crucial
role
at
the
crossroads
between
physiological
and
pathological
forms
of
emotion
.
If
this
is
the
case
,
one
would
expect
that
not_only
the
various
procedures
just
mentioned
which
alter
the
hypothalamic
balance
would
influence
emotional_state
and
behavior
but
that
emotion
itself
would
act
likewise
.
We
pointed_out
that
emotional
excitement
may
lead
to
psychosomatic_disorders
and
neurotic
symptoms
,
particularly
in
certain
types
of
personality
,
but
it
is
also
known
that
the
reliving
of
a
strong
emotion
(
``
abreaction
''
)
may
cure
a
battle
neurosis
.
This
phenomenon
raises
the
question
whether
the
guidance
of
the
emotions
for
therapeutic
ends
may_not
have
an
even
wider
application
in
the
area
of
the
neuroses
.
Being
a
strictly
physiological
procedure
,
one
may
expect
from
such
a
study
additional
information
on
the
nature
of
the
emotional
process
itself
.
Wolpe
's
experiments
and
therapeutic
work
lie_in
this
area
.
He
showed
convincingly
that
anxiety
is
a
learned
(
conditioned_)_reaction
and
is
the
basis
of
experimental
and
clinical
neuroses
and
assumed
,
therefore
,
that
the
neuronal
changes
which
underlie
the
neuroses
are
functional
and
reversible
.
An
important
observation
of
Pavlov
served
as
a
guide_post
to
achieve
such
a
reversibility
by
physiological
means
.
In
a
conditioning
experiment
,
he
demonstrated
the
antagonism
between
feeding
and
pain
.
A
mild
electrical_shock
served
as
a
conditioned_stimulus
and
was
followed
by
feeding
.
The
pain
became
thus
the
symbol
for
food
and
elicited
salivary
secretion
(
conditioned_reflex
)
.
Even
when
the
intensity
of
the
shocks
was
increased
gradually
,
it
failed
to
evoke
any
signs
of
pain
.
Since
strong
nociceptive
stimuli
produce
an
experimental
neurosis
during
which
the
animals
fail
to
eat
in
the
experimental
situation
,
Wolpe
thought
that
he
could
utilize
the
feeding
pain
antagonism
to
inhibit
the
neurotic
symptoms
through
feeding
.
Appropriate
experiments
showed
that
this
is
,
indeed
,
possible
.
He
then
applied
this
principle
of
reciprocal
inhibition
to
human
neuroses
.
He
took
advantage
of
the
antagonism
between
aggressive
assertiveness
and
anxiety
and
found
a
relatively
rapid
disappearance
of
anxiety
when
the
former
attitude
was
established
.
For
the
interpretation
of
these
significant
investigations
,
it
should
be
remembered
that
reciprocal
relations
exist
in
the
hypothalamus
with
respect
to
autonomic
and
somatic
functions
which
are
closely
associated
with
the
emotions
.
The
feeding
pain
antagonism
seems
to
be
based
on
this
reciprocal
relation
between
the
tropho
-
and
ergotropic
systems
.
Furthermore
,
a
functional
antagonism
exists
between
an
aggressive
attitude
and
a
state
of
anxiety
.
Although
in
both
emotions
sympathetic
symptoms
are
present
,
different
autonomic
somatic
patterns
underlie
aggression
and
anxiety
,
respectively
,
as
indicated
by
the
rate
of
the
excretion
of
the
catecholamines
,
the
state
of
the
muscle_tone
,
and
the
Mecholyl_test
.
The
psychological
incompatibility
of
these
emotional_states
seems
to
be
reflected
in
,
or
based
on
,
this
marked
difference
.
In
our
attempt
to
interpret
the
emotions
in
their
physiological
and
pathological
range
,
we
emphasized
the
importance
of
the
degree
of
activity
of
the
parasympathetic
and
sympathetic
divisions
of
the
hypothalamic
system
and
their
influence
on
the
inhibitory
and
excitatory
systems
,
respectively
.
We
stressed
the
reciprocal
relation
of
these
systems
with
respect
to
the
autonomic
somatic
downward
discharge
as_well_as
regarding
the
hypothalamic
cortical
discharge
.
Although
we
are
still
far
from
a
complete
understanding
of
these
problems
,
as
a
first
approximation
,
it
is
suggested
that
alterations
in
the
hypothalamic
balance
with
consequent
changes
in
the
hypothalamic
cortical
discharges
account_for
major
changes
in
behavior
seen
in
various
moods
and
states
of
emotions
in
man
and
beast
under
physiological
circumstances
,
in
experimental
and
clinical
neurosis
,
and
as
the
result
of
psychopharmacological
agents
.
In_view_of
the
important
role
which
emotional_disturbances
play
in
the
genesis
of
neurotic
and
psychotic
disorders
and
the
parallelism
observed
between
autonomic
states
and
psychological
behavior
in
several
instances
,
it
is
further
suggested
that
a
hypothalamic
imbalance
may
play
an
important
role
in
initiating
mental
changes
.
