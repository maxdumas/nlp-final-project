Resentment
welled_up
yesterday
among
Democratic
district
leaders
and
some
county
leaders
at
reports
that
Mayor_Wagner
had
decided
to
seek
a
third
term
with
Paul_R._Screvane
and
Abraham_D._Beame
as
running_mates
.
At_the_same_time
reaction
among
anti-organization
Democratic
leaders
and
in
the
Liberal_party
to
the
Mayor
's
reported
plan
was
generally
favorable
.
Some
anti-organization
Democrats
saw
in
the
program
an
opportunity
to
end
the
bitter
internal
fight
within
the
Democratic_party
that
has
been
going_on
for
the
last
three
years
.
The
resentment
among
Democratic
organization
leaders
to
the
reported
Wagner
plan
was
directed
particularly
at
the
Mayor
's
efforts
to
name
his
own
running_mates
without
consulting
the
leaders
.
Some
viewed
this
attempt
as
evidence
that
Mr._Wagner
regarded
himself
as
bigger
than
the
party
.
Some
Democratic
district
and
county
leaders
are
reported
trying
to
induce
State_Controller_Arthur_Levitt
of
Brooklyn
to
oppose
Mr._Wagner
for
the
Mayoral
nomination
in
the
Sept.
7
Democratic
primary
.
These
contend
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
Mr._Wagner
has
the
confidence
of
the
Democratic
rank_and_file
in
the
city
.
Their
view
is
that
last-minute
changes
the
Mayor
is
proposing
to
make
in
the
Democratic
ticket
only
emphasize
the
weakness
of
his
performance
as
Mayor
.
In
an
apparent
effort
to
head_off
such
a
rival
primary
slate
,
Mr._Wagner
talked
by
telephone
yesterday
with
Representative_Charles_A._Buckley
,
the_Bronx
Democratic
leader
,
and
with
Joseph_T._Sharkey
,
the
Brooklyn
Democratic
leader
.
As_usual
,
he
made
no
attempt
to
get_in_touch
with
Carmine_G._De_Sapio
,
the
Manhattan
leader
.
He
is
publicly
on
record
as
believing
Mr._De_Sapio
should
be
replaced
for
the
good
of
the
party
.
Last
night
the
Mayor
visited
Mr._Buckley
at
the_Bronx
leader
's
home
for
a
discussion
of
the
situation
.
Apparently
he
believes
Mr._Buckley
holds
the
key
to
the
Democratic
organization
's
acceptance
of
his
choices
for
running_mates
without
a
struggle
.
In
talks
with
Mr._Buckley
last
week
in
Washington
,
the
Mayor
apparently
received
the_Bronx
leader
's
assent
to
dropping
Controller_Lawrence_E._Gerosa
,
who
lives
in
the_Bronx
,
from
this
year
's
ticket
.
But
Mr._Buckley
seems
to
have
assumed
he
would
be
given
the
right
to
pick
Mr._Gerosa
's
successor
.
The
Mayor
declined
in
two
interviews
with
reporters
yesterday
to
confirm
or
deny
the
reports
that
he
had
decided
to
run
and
wanted
Mr._Screvane
,
who
lives
in
Queens
,
to
replace
Abe_Stark
,
the
incumbent
,
as
the
candidate
for
President
of
the
City_Council
and
Mr._Beame
,
who
lives
in
Brooklyn
,
to
replace
Mr._Gerosa
as
the
candidate
for
Controller
.
The
Mayor
spoke
yesterday
at
the
United
Irish
Counties
Feis
on
the
Hunter_College_Campus
in
the_Bronx
.
After
his
speech
,
reporters
asked
him
about
the
report
of
his
political
intentions
,
published
in
yesterday
's
New_York
Times
.
The
Mayor
said
:
``
It
did
n't
come
from
me
.
But
as
I
have
said
before
,
if
I
announce
my
candidacy
,
I
will
have
something
definite
to
say
about
running_mates
''
.
A
wave
of
public
resentment
against
corruption
in
government
is
rising
in
Massachusetts
.
There
is
a
tangible
feeling
in_the_air
of
revulsion
toward
politics
.
The
taxi
driver
taking
the
visitor
from
the
airport
remarks
that
politicians
in
the
state
are
``
all_the_same
''
.
``
It
's
'
See
Joe
,
see
Jim
''
'
,
he
says
.
``
The
hand
is
out
''
.
A
political_scientist
writes_of
the
growth
of
``
alienated
voters
''
,
who
``
believe
that
voting
is
useless
because
politicians
or
those
who
influence
politicians
are
corrupt
,
selfish
and
beyond
popular
control
.
These
voters
view
the
political
process
as
a
secret
conspiracy
,
the
object
of_which
is
to
plunder
them
''
.
Corruption
is
hardly_a
recent
development
in
the
city
and
state
that
were
widely
identified
as
the
locale
of
Edwin_O
'
Connor
's
novel
,
``
The
Last
Hurrah
''
.
But
there
are
reasons
for
the
current
spotlight
on
the
subject
.
A
succession
of
highly
publicized
scandals
has
aroused
the
public
within
the
last
year
.
Graft
in
the
construction
of
highways
and
other
public_works
has
brought_on
state
and
Federal
investigations
.
And
the
election
of
President_Kennedy
has
attracted
new
attention
to
the
ethical
climate
of
his
home
state
.
A
reader
of
the
Boston
newspapers
can
hardly
escape
the
impression
that
petty
chicanery
,
or
worse
,
is
the
norm
in
Massachusetts
public
life
.
Day_after_day
some
new
episode
is
reported
.
The
state
Public_Works
Department
is
accused
of
having
spent
$
8555
to
build
a
private
beach
for
a
state
judge
on
his
waterfront
property
.
An
assistant
attorney_general
is
directed
to
investigate
.
Congress
starts
another
week
tomorrow
with
sharply
contrasting
forecasts
for
the
two
chambers
.
In
the
Senate
,
several
bills
are
expected
to
pass
without
any
major
conflict
or
opposition
.
In
the
House
,
the
Southern-Republican
coalition
is
expected
to
make
another
major
stand
in
opposition
to
the
Administration
's
housing
bill
,
while
more
jockeying
is
expected
in
an
attempt
to
advance
the
aid-to-education
bill
.
The
housing
bill
is
now
in
the
House_Rules_Committee
.
It
is
expected
to
be
reported_out
Tuesday
,
but
this
is
a_little
uncertain
.
The
panel
's
action
depends_on
the
return
of
Representative_James_W._Trimble
,
Democrat
of
Arkansas
,
who
has
been
siding
with
Speaker_Sam_Rayburn
's
forces
in
the
Rules_Committee
in
moving
bills
to
the
floor
.
Mr._Trimble
has
been
in
the
hospital
but
is
expected
back
Tuesday
.
The
housing
bill
is
expected
to
encounter
strong
opposition
by
the
coalition
of
Southern
Democrats
and
conservative
Republicans
.
The
Democratic
leadership
,
however
,
hopes
to
pass
it
sometime
this
week
.
The
$
6100000000
measure
,
which
was
passed
last
Monday
by
the
Senate
,
provides_for
forty-year
mortgages
at
low
down-payments
for
moderate-income
families
.
It
also
provides_for
funds
to
clear
slums
and
help
colleges
build
dormitories
.
The
education
bill
appears
to
be
temporarily
stalled
in
the
Rules_Committee
,
where
two
Northern
Democratic
members
who
usually
vote
with
the
Administration
are
balking
because
of
the
religious
controversy
.
They
are
James_J._Delaney
of
Queens
and
Thomas_P._O
'
Neill_Jr.
of
Massachusetts
.
What
could
rescue
the
bill
would
be
some
quick
progress
on
a
bill
amending
the
National_Defense_Education_Act
of
1958
.
This
would
provide_for
long-term
Federal
loans
for
construction
of
parochial
and
other
private-school
facilities
for
teaching
science
,
languages
and
mathematics
.
Mr._Delaney
and
Mr._O
'
Neill
are
not
willing
to
vote
on
the
public-school
measure
until
the
defense
education
bill
clears
the
House_Education
and
Labor_Committee
.
About
half
of
all
Peace_Corps
projects
assigned
to
voluntary
agencies
will
be
carried_out
by
religious
groups
,
according
to
an
official
of
the
corps
.
In
the
$
40000000
budget
that
has
been
submitted
for
Congressional
approval
,
$
26000000
would
be
spent
through
universities
and
private
voluntary
agencies
.
Twelve
projects
proposed
by
private
groups
are
at
the
contract-negotiation
stage
,
Gordon_Boyce
,
director
of
relations
with
the
voluntary
agencies
,
said
in
a
Washington
interview
.
Six
of
these
were
proposed
by
religious
groups
.
They
will
be
for
teaching
,
agriculture
and
community
development
in
Southeast_Asia
,
Africa
,
the
Middle_East
and
Latin_America
.
Interviews
with
several
church
leaders
have
disclosed
that
this
development
has
raised
the
question
whether
the
Peace_Corps
will
be
able
to
prevent
confusion
for
church
and
state
over
methods
,
means
and
goals
.
There
are
a_number_of
ways
this
could
happen
,
the
churchmen
pointed_out
,
and
here
is
an
example
:
Last
month
in
Ghana
an
American
missionary
discovered
when
he
came_to
pay
his
hotel_bill
that
the
usual
rate
had
been
doubled
.
When
he
protested
,
the
hotel
owner
said
:
``
Why
do
you
worry
?
The
U._S._Government
is
paying
for
it
.
The
U._S._Government
pays
for
all
its
overseas
workers
''
.
``
I
do
n't
work
for
the
Government
''
,
the
American
said
.
``
I
'm
a
missionary
''
.
The
hotel
owner
shrugged
.
``
Same
thing
''
,
he
said
.
And_then
,
some
churchmen
remarked
,
there
is
a
more
classical
church-state
problem
:
Can
religious
agencies
use
Government
funds
and
Peace_Corps
personnel
in
their
projects
and
still
preserve
the
constitutional
requirement
on
separation
of
church
and
state
?
R._Sargent_Shriver_Jr.
,
director
of
the
corps
,
is
certain
that
they
can
.
No
religious
group
,
he
declared
in
an
interview
,
will
receive
Peace_Corps
funds
unless
it
forswears
all
proselytizing
on
the
project
it
proposes
.
At
a
gay
party
in
the
Kremlin
for
President_Sukarno
of
Indonesia
,
Premier_Khrushchev
pulled_out
his
pockets
and
said
,
beaming
:
``
Look
,
he
took
everything
I
had
''
!
Mr._Khrushchev
was
jesting
in
the
expansive
mood
of
the
successful
banker
.
Indonesia
is
one
of
the
twenty
under-developed
countries
of
Asia
,
Africa
and
Latin_America
that
are
receiving
Soviet
aid
.
The
Soviet_Union
and
other
members
of
the
Communist
bloc
are
rapidly
expanding
their
economic
,
technical
and
military
assistance
to
the
uncommitted
nations
.
The
Communist
countries
allocated
more_than
$
1000000000
in
economic
aid
alone
last
year
,
according
to
Western
estimates
.
This
was
the
biggest
annual
outlay
since
the
Communist
program
for
the
under-developed
countries
made
its
modest
beginning
in
1954
.
In
1960
more_than
6000
Communist
technicians
were
present
in
those
countries
.
A
committee
of
experts
has
recommended
that
a
country
's
population
be
considered
in
the
distribution
of
professional
posts
at
the
United_Nations
.
This
was
disclosed
today
by
a
responsible
source
amid
intensified
efforts
by
the
Soviet_Union
to
gain
a
greater
role
in
the
staff
and
operation
of
the
United_Nations
.
One
effect
of
the
proposal
,
which
puts
a
premium
on
population
instead
of
economic
strength
,
as
in_the_past
,
would
be
to
take
jobs
from
European_nations
and
give
more
to
such
countries
as
India
.
India
is
the_most
populous
United_Nations
member
with
more_than
400000000
inhabitants
.
The
new
formula
for
filling
staff
positions
in
the
Secretariat
is
one
of
a_number_of
recommendations
made
by
a
panel
of
eight
in
a
long
and
detailed
report
.
The
report
was
completed
after
nearly
eighteen
months
of
work
on
the
question
of
the
organization
of
the
United_Nations
.
The
Advisory_Committee
on
Administrative
and
Budgetary
Questions
is
expected
to
receive
the
report
this
week
.
The
jobs
formula
is
understood
to
follow
these
lines
:
Each
of
the
organization
's
ninety-nine
members
would
get
two
professional
posts
,
such_as
political
affairs
officer
,
a
department_head
or
an
economist
,
to
start
.
Each
member
would
get
one
post
for
each
10000000
people
in
its
population
up_to
150000000
people
or
a
maximum
of
fifteen
posts
.
Each
member
with
a
population
above
150000000
would
get
one
additional
post
for
each
additional
30000000
people
up_to
an
unspecified
cut-off
point
.
The
three
leaders
of
Laos
agreed
today
to
begin
negotiations
tomorrow
on
forming
a
coalition
government
that
would
unite
the
war-ridden
kingdom
.
The
decision
was
made
in
Zurich
by
Prince_Boun_Oum
,
Premier
of
the
pro-Western
royal
Government
;
Prince_Souvanna_Phouma
,
leader
of
the
nation
's
neutralists
and
recognized
as
Premier
by
the
Communist
bloc
,
and
Prince_Souphanouvong
,
head
of
the
pro-Communist
Pathet_Lao
forces
.
The
latter
two
are
half-brothers
.
Their
joint
statement
was
welcomed
by
the
Western
delegations
who
will
attend
tomorrow
the
nineteenth
plenary
session
of
the
fourteen-nation
conference
on
the
future
of
Laos
.
An
agreement
among
the
Princes
on
a
coalition
government
would
ease
their
task
,
diplomats
conceded
.
But
no
one
was
overly
optimistic
.
W._Averell_Harriman
of
the
United_States
,
Malcolm_MacDonald
of
Britain
,
Maurice_Couve
de
Murville
,
France
's
Foreign_Minister
,
and
Howard_C._Green
,
Canada
's
Minister
of
External
Affairs
,
concluded
,
meanwhile
,
a
round
of
consultations
here
on
future
tactics
in
the
conference
.
The
pace
of
the
talks
has
slowed
with
each
passing
week
.
Princess_Moune
,
Prince_Souvanna_Phouma
's
young
daughter
,
read
the
Princes
'
statement
.
They
had
a
two-hour
luncheon
together
in
``
an
atmosphere
of
cordial
understanding
and
relaxation
''
,
she
said
.
The
three
Laotians
agreed
upon
a
six-point
agenda
for
their
talks
,
which
are
to
last
three
days
.
The
Princess
said
it
was
too
early
to
say
what
would
be
decided
if
no
agreement
was
reached
after
three
days
.
The
meetings
in
Zurich
,
the
statement
said
,
would
deal
only
with
principles
that
would
guide
the
three
factors
in
their
search
for
a
coalition
Government
.
