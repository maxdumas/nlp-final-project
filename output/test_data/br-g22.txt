Does
our
society
have
a
runaway
,
uncontrollable
growth
of
technology
which
may
end
our
civilization
,
or
a
normal
,
healthy
growth
?
Here
there
may
be
an
analogy
with
cancer
:
we
can
detect
cancers
by
their
rapidly
accelerating
growth
,
determinable
only_when
related_to
the
more
normal
rate
of
healthy
growth
.
Should
the
accelerating
growth
of
technology
then
warn
us
?
Noting
such
evidence
is
the
first_step
;
and
almost
the
only
``
cure
''
is
early
detection
and
removal
.
One
way
to
determine
whether
we
have
so
dangerous
a
technology
would
be
to
check
the
strength
of
our
society
's
organs
to
see
if
their
functioning
is
as
healthy
as
before
.
So
an
objective
look
at
our
present
procedures
may
move
us
to
consider
seriously
this
possibly
analogous
situation
.
In_any_event
,
whether
society
may
have
cancer
,
or
merely
a
virus
infection
,
the
``
disease
''
,
we
shall
find
,
is
political
,
economical
,
social
,
and
even
medical
.
Have
not
our
physical_abilities
already
deteriorated
because
of
the
more
sedentary
lives
we
are
now
living
?
Hence
the
prime
issue
,
as
I
see
it
,
is
whether
a
democratic
or
free
society
can
master
technology
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
,
or
whether
technology
will
rule
and
develop
its
own
society
compatible
with
its
own
needs
as
a
force
of
nature
.
We
are
already
committed
to
establishing
man
's
supremacy
over
nature
and
everywhere
on
earth
,
not
merely
in
the
limited
social
political
economical
context
we
are
fond
of
today
.
Otherwise
,
we
go_on
endlessly
trying
to
draw_the_line
,
color
and
other
,
as
to
which
kind_of
man
we
wish
to
see
dominate
.
We
have
proved
so
able
to
solve
technological
problems
that
to
contend
we
cannot
realize
a
universal
goal
in
the
immediate
future
is
to
be
extremely
shortsighted
,
if
nothing
else
.
We
must
believe
we
have
the
ability
to
affect
our
own
destinies
:
otherwise
why
try
anything
?
So
in
these
pages
the
term
``
technology
''
is
used
to
include
any
and
all
means
which
could
amplify
,
project
,
or
augment
man
's
control
over
himself
and
over
other
men
.
Naturally
this
includes
all
communication
forms
,
e._g.
languages
,
or
any
social
,
political
,
economic
or
religious
structures
employed
for
such
control
.
Properly
mindful
of
all
the
cultures
in
existence
today
throughout
the
world
,
we
must
employ
these
resources
without
war
or
violent
revolution
.
If
we
were
creating
a
wholly
new
society
,
we
could
insist
that
our
social
,
political
,
economic
and
philosophic
institutions
foster
rather
than
hamper
man
;
best
growth
.
But
we
cannot
start
off
with
a
clean_slate
.
So
we
must
first
analyze
our
present
institutions
with_respect_to
the
effect
of
each
on
man
's
major
needs
.
Asked
which
institution
most
needs
correction
,
I
would
say
the
corporation
as
it
exists
in
America
today
.
At_first_glance
this
appears
strange
:
of
all
people
,
was
not
America
founded
by
rugged_individualists
who
established
a
new
way_of_life
still
inspiring
``
undeveloped
''
societies
abroad
?
But
hear
Harrison_E._Salisbury
,
former
Moscow
correspondent
of
The_New_York_Times
,
and
author
of
``
To_Moscow_-_And_Beyond
''
.
In
a
book
review
of
``
The_Soviet_Cultural_Offensive
''
,
he
says
,
``
Long
before
the
State_Department
organized
its
bureaucracy
into
an
East-West_Contacts_Staff
in_order
to
wage
a
cultural
counter-offensive
within
Soviet
borders
,
the
sharp
cutting-edge
of
American
culture
had
carved
its
mark
across
the
Russian
steppes
,
as
when
the
enterprising
promoters
of
'
Porgy_and_Bess
'
overrode
the
State_Department
to
carry
the
contemporary
'
cultural
warfare
'
behind
the
enemy
lines
.
They
were
not
diplomats
or
jazz_musicians
,
or
even
organizers
of
reading-rooms
and
photo_montage
displays
,
but
rugged
capitalist
entrepreneurs
like
Henry_Ford
,
Hugh_Cooper
,
Thomas_Campbell
,
the
International_Harvester_Co.
,
and
David_W._Griffith
.
Their
kind
created
an
American
culture
superior
to
any
in
the
world
,
an
industrial
and
technological
culture
which
penetrated
Russia
as
it
did
almost
every
corner
of
the
earth
without
a
nickel
from
the
Federal
treasury
or
a
single
governmental
specialist
to
contrive
directives
or
program
a
series
of
consultations
of
interested
agencies
.
This
favorable
image
of
America
in
the
minds
of
Russian
men
and
women
is
still
there
despite
years
of
energetic
anti
American
propaganda
''
.
Perhaps
the
public
's
present
attitude
toward
business
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
``
rugged
capitalist
entrepreneur
''
no_more
exists
in
America
.
In
his
stead
is
a
milquetoast
version
known_as
``
the
corporation
''
.
But
even
if
we
cannot
see
the
repulsive
characteristics
in
this
new
image
of
America
,
foreigners
can
;
and
our
loss
of
``
prestige
''
abroad
is
the
direct
result
.
No
amount
of
ballyhoo
will
cover_up
the
sordid
facts
.
If
we
want
respect
from
ourselves
or
others
,
we
will
have
to
earn
it
.
First
,
let
us
realize
that
whatever
good
this
set-up
achieved
in
earlier
times
,
now
the
corporation
per_se
cannot
take
economic
leadership
.
Businesses
must
develop
as
a
result
of
the
ideas
,
energies
and
ambitions
of
an
individual
having
purpose
and
comprehensive
ability
within
one
mind
.
When
we
``
forced
''
individuals
to
assume
the
corporate
structure
by
means
of
taxes
and
other
legal
statutes
,
we
adopted
what
I
would
term
``
pseudo
capitalism
''
and
so
took
a
major
step
toward
socialism
.
The
biggest
loss
,
of_course
,
was
the
individual
's
lessened
desire
and
ability
to
give
his
services
to
the
growth
of
his
company
and
our
economy
.
Socialism
,
I
grant
,
has
a
definite
place
in
our
society
.
But
let
us
not
complain
of
the
evils
of
capitalism
by
referring
to
a
form
that
is
not
truly
capitalistic
.
Some
forms
of
capitalism
do
indeed
work
-
superb
organizations
,
a
credit
to
any
society
.
But
the
pseudo
capitalism
which
dictates
our
whole
economy
as_well
as
our
politics
and
social
life
,
will
not
stand
close
scrutiny
.
Its
pretense
to
operate
in
the
public
interest
is
little
more
than
a
sham
.
It
serves
only
its
own
stockholders
and
poorly
at
that
.
As
a
creative
enterprise
,
its
abilities
are
primarily
in
``
swallowing
''
creative
enterprises
developed
outside
its
own
organization
(
an
ability
made
possible
by
us
,
and
almost
mandatory
)
.
As
to
benefits
to
employees
,
it
is
notorious
for
its
callous
disregard
except
where
it
depends_on
them
for
services
.
The
corporation
in
America
is
in_reality
our
form
of
socialism
,
vying
in_a_sense
with
the
other
socialistic
form
that
has
emerged
within
governmental
bureaucracy
.
But
while
the
corporation
has
all
the
disadvantages
of
the
socialist
form
of
organization
(
so
cumbersome
it
cannot
constructively
do
much
of
anything
not
compatible
with
its
need
to
perpetuate
itself
and
maintain
its
status_quo
)
,
unluckily
it
does
not
have
the
desirable
aspect
of
socialism
,
the
motivation
to
operate
for
the
benefit
of
society
as_a_whole
.
So
we
are
faced
with
a
vast
network
of
amorphous
entities
perpetuating
themselves
in
whatever
manner
they
can
,
without
regard_to
the
needs
of
society
,
controlling
society
and
forcing
upon
it
a
regime
representing
only
the
corporation
's
needs
for
survival
.
The
corporation
has
a
limited
,
specific
place
in
our
society
.
Ideally
speaking
,
it
should
be
allowed
to
operate
only
where
the
public
has
a
great
stake
in
the
continuity
of
supply
or
services
,
and
where
the
actions
of
a
single
proprietor
are
secondary
to
the
needs
of
society
.
Examples
are
in
public
utilities
,
making
military
aircraft
and
accessories
,
or
where
the
investment
and
risk
for
a
proprietorship
would
be
too
great
for
a
much
needed
project
impossible
to
achieve
by_any_means
other_than
the
corporate
form
,
e._g.
constructing
major
airports
or
dams
.
Thus
,
if
corporations
are
not
to
run_away
with
us
,
they
must
become
quasi
governmental
institutions
,
subject_to
public
control
and
needs
.
In
all
other
areas
,
private
initiative
of
the
``
proprietorship
''
type
should
be
urged
to
produce
the
desired
goods
and
services
.
Avoiding
runaway
technology
can
be
done
only
by
assuring
a
humane
society
;
and
for
this
human_beings
must
be
firmly
in
control
of
the
economics
on
which
our
society
rests
.
Such
genuine
human
leadership
the
proprietorship
can
offer
,
corporations
cannot
.
It
can
project
long-range
goals
for
itself
.
Corporations
react
violently
to
short-range
stimuli
,
e._g.
,
quarterly
and
annual
dividend
reports
.
Proprietorships
can
establish
a
unity
and
integrity
of
control
;
corporations
,
being
more
amorphous
,
cannot
.
Proprietorships
can
establish
a
meaningful
identity
,
representing
a
human
personality
,
and
thus
establish
sincere
relationships
with
customers
and
community
.
Corporations
are
apt
by_nature
to
be
impersonal
,
inhumane
,
shortsighted
and
almost
exclusively
profit
motivated
,
a
picture
they
could
scarcely
afford
to
present
to
the
public
.
The
proprietor
is
able
to
create
a
leadership
impossible
in
the
corporate
structure
with
its
board_of_directors
and
stockholders
.
Leadership
is
lacking
in
our
society
because
it
has
no
legitimate
place
to
develop
.
Men
continuously
at
the
head
of
growing
enterprises
can
acquire
experiences
of
the
most
varied
,
complicated
and
trying
type
so
that
at
maturation
they
have
developed
the
competence
and
willingness
to
accept
the
personal
responsibility
so
sorely
needed
now
.
Hence
government
must
establish
greater
controls
upon
corporations
so
that
their
activities
promote
what
is
deemed
essential
to
the
national
interest
.
Proprietorships
should
get
the
tax_advantages
now
accruing
to
corporations
,
e._g.
the
chance
to
accumulate
capital
so
vital
for
growth
.
Corporations
should
pay
added
taxes
,
to
be
used
for
educational
purposes
(
not
necessarily
of
the
formal
type
)
.
The
right
to
leave
legacies
should
be
substantially
reduced
and
ultimately
eliminated
.
To
perpetuate
wealth
control
led
by
small
groups
of
individuals
who
played
no
role
in
its
creation
prevents
those
with
real
initiative
from
coming_to_the_fore
,
and
is
basically
anti
democratic
.
When
the
proprietor
dies
,
the
establishment
should
become
a
corporation
until
it
is
either
acquired
by
another
proprietor
or
the
government
decides
to
drop
it
.
Strikes
should
be
declared
illegal
against
corporations
because
disagreements
would
have
to
be
settled
by
government
representatives
acting_as
controllers
of
the
corporation
whose
responsibility
to
the
state
would
now
be
defined
against
proprietorship
because
employees
and
proprietors
must
be
completely
interdependent
,
as
they
are
each
a
part
of
the
whole
.
Strikes
threatening
the
security
of
the
proprietorship
,
if
internally
motivated
,
prevent
a
healthy
relationship
.
Certainly
external
forces
should
not
be
applied
arbitrarily
out
of
mere
power
available
to
do
so
.
If
we
cannot
stop
warfare
in
our
own
economic_system
,
how
can
we
expect
to
abolish
it
internationally
?
These
proposals
would
go_far
toward
creating
the
economic
atmosphere
favoring
growth
of
the
individual
,
who
,
in_turn
,
would
help
us
to
cope_with
runaway
technology
.
Individual
human
strength
is
needed
to
pit
against
an
inhuman
condition
.
The
battle
is
not
easy
.
We
are
tempted
to
blame
others
for
our
problems
rather
than
look
them
straight
in
the
face
and
realize
they
are
of_our_own
making
and
possible
of
solution
only
by
ourselves
with
the
help
of
desperately
needed
,
enlightened
,
competent
leaders
.
Persons
developed
in
to-day
's
corporations
cannot
hope
to
serve
here
-
a
judgment
based
on
experiences
of
my
own
in
business
and
in
activities
outside
.
In
my
own
company
,
in_effect
a
partnership
,
although
legally
a
corporation
,
I
have
been
able
to
do
many
things
for
my
employees
which
``
normal
''
corporations
of
comparable
size
and
nature
would
have
been
unable
to
do
.
Also
,
I
am
convinced
that
if
my
company
were
a
sole
proprietorship
instead
of
a
partnership
,
I
would
have
been
even
abler
to
solve
long-range
problems
for
myself
and
my
fellow
employees
.
Any
abilities
I
may
have
were
achieved
in
their
present
shape
from
experience
in
sharing_in
the
growth
and
control
of
my
business
,
coupled
with
raising
my
family
.
This
combined
experience
,
on
a
foundation
of
very
average
,
I
assure
you
,
intelligence
and
background
,
has
helped
me
do
things
many
well-informed
people
would
bet
heavily
against
.
Perhaps
a
list
of
some
of
the
``
practices
''
of
my
company
will
help
here
.
The
company
grew
out
of
efforts
by
two
completely
inexperienced
men
in
their
late
twenties
,
neither
having
a
formal
education
applicable
to
,
or
experience
in
,
manufacturing
or
selling
our
type
of
articles
.
From
an
initial
investment
of
$
1200
in
1943
,
it
has
grown
,
with
no
additional
capital
investment
,
to
a
present
value
estimated
by
some
as
exceeding
$
10000000
(
we
do
n't
disclose
financial
figures
to
the
public
)
.
Its
growth
continues
steadily
on
a
par
with
past
growth
;
and
no
limitation
is
in_evidence
.
Our
pin-curl
clips
and
self-locking
nuts
achieved
dominance
in
just
a_few
years
time
,
despite
substantial
,
well
established
competition
.
