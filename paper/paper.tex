Beans beans beans. Right! This is a two column layout, so the title here is actually centered on the page.

\section{Introduction}
Introduce our solution to the problem and necessary background information.

\section{The Naive Bayes Classifier}
Explain in exact detail the Na√Øve Bayes Classifier algorithm. This should more or less follow the format of project proposal

\section{Implementation}
Discuss exactly what techniques were used to implement the algorithm. What technical issues/limitations resulted in changes? Figure out exactly what techniques we're co-opting for pos-tagging, lemmatizing, etc!

Talk about the baseline also.

Switched to POS-informed lemmatizer instead of simply choosing lemma with largest count, doubled accuracy.

\section{Analysis}
Discuss here the performance and results of applying the algorithm.

\section{Conclusion}
Discuss here what went wrong, what went right, avenues for improvement, further reading, etc.
